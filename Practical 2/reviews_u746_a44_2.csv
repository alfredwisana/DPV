    Urusei Yatsura is known for being the first masterpiece of Rumiko Takahashi, author of series like Ranma 1/2, Inuyasha and recently Kyoukai no Rinne. Originally her publications started in Shounen Sunday in 1978 with eventual releases, suddenly it was being published weekly thanks to the success it had. This also made it become an anime that was very liked, making it have 195 episodes, 12 OVAs and 6 movies. 
If we compare her work with others, Urusei Yatsura goes more to science fiction, since somehow she mixes things from spiritual worlds that the mangaka adds in her other works; anyways, this story talks about how a girl from another world gets involved with a lusty earthling. 
On the other hand the comedy, along with the romance, are the basis to develop the story that ends up in very surreal moments. 
As the main characters we have Lum, a girl that belongs to the Onis alien race (a mixture of human and ogre that have special abilities, like flying, throw fire, shapeshifting between others) 
She's the princess of her planet. Without much common sense, she looks always extravagant and vivacious in front of any situation, thanks to how uninhibited she can get to be. Contrasting her joyful personality, she has some explosive temperament that is triggered by the jealous she suffers from her love relationship. Naive but smart, loyal and faithful to her boyfriend, are other adjectives to describe her. In addition her beauty, that is enhanced by the animal-printed bikini she always wears, makes other's guys heads turn to look at her. 
Ataru Moroboshi is the male main character of the story. This guy since early age has developed a extreme like for females, that's why he's 90% of the time trying to chase girls. 
He ended up engaged with Lum after defeating her in a battle to prevent the Oni's invasion. Lustful, stubborn, egocentric and ungrateful are part of her personality, But as the story develops, those ""qualities"" weaken while getting more dignifying ones. 
There are other characters that maintain contact with the couple, making Ataru's life complicated since he's always stalked by Lum because he's a womanizer. Every situation ends bad for Ataru, he's usually beaten physically by the girls he chases, specially Lum that has the ability to throw electric charges, Lum's personality can be tedious for the audience (if we compare her to a contemporany character, I'd say Kirino from Oreimo). 
The first episodes are short stories that don't get in too deep, that is coherent to the manga. But as the story advances, the complexity of each episode increases gradually until getting a plot thought to make each episode last the usual time of every regular anime. 
Thanks to this, the characters start to develop. Each one gets new qualities that helps their participation in the anime strengthen. Naturally, one by one, get to transmit spontaneously to the audience their feelings, even in a simple way as the time goes. All define their profiles correctly until they reach the point the author desired. 
This said, the structure gives us a easy-to-digest anime, without many complications, thanks to how light it is (considering the number of episodes), this, along with how funny it can get to be thanks to the crazy situations Ataru gets involved day by day.  
Without a doubt, this Rumiko Takahashi's work is of utmost importance for sustaining the basis that will help her build in other stories posterior to this one. Even if we know that Rumiko tends to recycle elements of her other works, her creativity is capable of create original stories full of charisma. That's how she's recognized all around the world, because of the ""innocent"" comedy that she adds to all her masterpieces. 
Urusei Yatsura is something so singular that you'll hardly find somewhere else. The charisma and comedy are unique and simple. If you enjoyed animes like Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha, you won't get disappointed to get a little Retro and watch this anime.

    Coming in as a big Rumiko Takahashi (creator of Inuyasha) fan, and having never seen Urusei Yatsura (Those Obnoxious Aliens), the pure anticipation of this show was salivating. With so much history, so much anime influenced, and how iconic this show was, this is a show to at least give a good try. However, coming in at 195 episodes, at what pace or how many episodes can one watch before giving some good insight on this show. The decision was made to watch a years’ worth, and that came in at about 44 episodes. 
This was Takahashi’s first work put on screen and it was a huge hit out of the park. Besides the large episode count and age, the other thing that might take away from the modern anime fan is how episodic it is. There are the few episodes that really stand out, but as for a plot... this is not the show to accomplish that. At heart, this anime knows what it is. It is a pure comedy focused around Ataru, the male womanizer, and Lum, the fantastic and adorable alien. Urusei Yatsura is downright hilarious. 
The characters make the show, and there is a lot. Ataru is a womanizer, general social idiot, but very likeable in his stupid antics. He is always causing trouble with his unsuccessful flirting, and generally being unlucky in every situation. Lum, is the cute alien girl whom falls for Ataru. The guess there is how energetic and fun he is? 
Lum alone is a character that lives on today even to the way she ends her sentences with -datcha. With her trademarked tiger striped bikini and go-go boots, she floats into everybody’s hearts in each episode. Even when wearing other clothes, she is adorable, turning heads, and her constant interaction with Ataru makes for a genuine comedy experience. Lum does not show any of the typical tropes that female characters show today. She is incredibly true to her feelings; ranging from the jelousy of Ataru flirting with others to her full devotion to the one she loves. Never does she come across as bossy or a flirt herself. She is always bringing out alien objects that cause for hilarious events to happen, causing chaos for Ataru of course. And, the list could go on and on about how great Lum is. 
Other cast of supporting characters is enormous. Throughout the show, new characters are introduced to spice up the environment such as: Ran (Lum’s childhood friend bent on revenge), Rei (Lum’s crazed ex-fiancé), Sakura (the hot priestess). The only downside is that these characters hardly show any development at all or if any. It is an episodic comedy after all. When it comes down to it, the show is about the constant ridiculousness between Ataru and Lum. Everybody else is there just to help those two out, and that is alright. 
As the series progresses, more music is added and while the art is old, it does not feel old. The character’s expressions are well done, and the characters are always changing looks and clothes keeping a fresh appeal in the show. All these character designs influenced anime for decades. 
This anime is a definite watch. This may give the impression of a harem with the guy chasing women, whom hate him, or just a cheesy comedy. Urusei Yatsura has something in it for everybody for at least a good laugh or two. I mean, I would love for a girl to be as devoted, as cute in tiger stripes, as electrifyingly fun as Lum is in my life. So watch it -datcha (you know).

    i just saw the beginning of the review for this anime saying how this is a classic. now i did not continue reading since it might influence my review of this anime.  now i found it hard to watch this anime because of the character reason a not the fact that it is old. even though it was old the animation did not suffer since i really like that anime style that they use. 
the story of this anime follow Ataru who is the biggest pervert in an anime i have ever seen who marries an alien name Lum because of a misunderstanding of words. after this it then follows the day to day life of Ataru who is has the worst of luck as he runs into aliens everyday. even though i enjoy watch these episode i really wish it would try focus on the development of Ataru relationship with Lum. 
now the character are another thing i dislike about this series as i will be talking about two that i hate the most.maybe they design the characters to be douches cause it worked. first Ataru since he is the main protagonist. now i hate him because of the bullsh#t he pulls. even though i see he has feeling for Lum, he is mean to her in almost every episode. i don't see why Lum would put up with him for so long. he evens try to get  with every girl even though he has Lum who is so Loyal and fateful that it just hurt me to see her with this guy. even though i hate him there were like 4 or 5 time so far where he actually is nice and i appreciate it since it show how there is a speck of hope for this scum. 
another character i want to rant on is Mendo as he is also a pervert but a totally different one that Ataru. now Mendo is more of a playboy who also like Ataru trying to get with all the girls but at least he has some pride. what i don't like about him is his personality as he thinks the is better than everyone else and feels like he too self absorb about his look. 
in the end i am still watching it hoping that it they don't just mess around for 170 episode and then serious at the last 4 episodes. 
overall even though it is a classic as they say i wouldn't say it is the best. 
i give this anime a 8/10

    This is a 1978 romantic comedy anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The story is about aliens that come to destroy Earth by before they do that they select a random person who lives on earth to complete a challenge and if they complete the challenge then earth won't be desroyed. The human selected is Ataru a peverted japanese boy in high school. The challenge is to touch the horns of the alien king's daughter.Her name is Lum.BTW she can fly. Ataru ends up completing the challenge and yells out that he will marry her. Lum thinks Ataru meant her but Ataru actually directed this at his classmate, Shinobou. Lum ends up living with Ataru shortly after and insanity ensues. For the time this plot was really original but now its pretty common. Plots like this are in animes like Tenchi Muyo, To love ru and may others. So this was kind of the first anime for its genre. 
The art is also good for its time. But compared to todays animation standard it sucks. But later in the series the tv episodes reach the 80s OVA animation qualitysince the show was so popular in Japan. 
The music is okay. Some of the songs are kind of catchy. 
And the characters. They are probably the best part of the series. Ataru is so retarded and peverted. He is always hitting on others girls and wants to get away from Lum. But deep down inside he actually loves her. Lum can also be really funny because since she only just came to earth she has the view of a kindergartener. There are also a lot of other wacky and zany characters that you meet later in the series like Ataru's ex GF, this super rich guy named Mendou and a ghost cat that haunts people that don't let him stay in their house(BTW he ends up fighting the dude from Fist of the North Star).  So overall this anime is classic. It may not be considered an anime classic to anmerican anime fans but it is in Japan. If you like Ranma 1/2 you'll love this

    *This is an archive from my Anime-Planet account* 
Critic's Log - Earthdate: July 15, 2012. Review #11: Urusei Yatsura 
If you want to know why I always start my reviews with ""Critic's Log"" and all that other technical stuff, it's because I like the franchise Star Trek, I believe every episode of the show starts off with the captain saying ""Captain's Log, Stardate"" something. I'm sort of making fun of that, I admit it... I am a Trekkie, not only am I a Trekkie, I'm also a Browncoat (fan of Firefly), a Gamer, a Brony (fan of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic), and OBVIOUSLY an Otaku (you know what an Otaku is... A fan of Anime. Duh!) So what does this have to do with this review? it doesn't... This is completely irrelevant to the review I'm doing but this is relevant for an intro to warm up the start of a review of an anime like the one I am about to discuss, here is Urusei Yatsura! 
Ataru Moroboshi is the unluckiest and most lecherous young man alive. When aliens decide to invade Earth, Ataru is randomly chosen to defend the planet Earth by playing a game of what the aliens consider a national sport... Tag. Should he win, the planet Earth will be saved. However, Ataru's motivation is for much far less noble reasons as the one he's up against is a curvaceous alien princess named Lum. The game goes on for 10 days, and on the last day... Ataru is motivated by his girlfriend assuring him marriage (and consequently... A marriage night one can think of) He finally catches Lum, however he gives his cry of joy for the coming marriage that he is assured of, which is misinterpreted by Lum as a marriage proposal, Lum promptly agrees, beginning the two's (quote-unquote) ""Marriage"" together. 
To be technical, the animation was from Studio Deen and Studio Pierrot, but the production of Urusei Yatsura was by Kitty Films. This is an 80's anime and at the time I wrote this review, it is almost been made 31 years ago. This is an anime that was immensely popular in Japan, and this is also an anime adaptation of the first manga that Rumiko Takahashi wrote and drew. This is also an influential anime on some levels, for having a lot of Japanese cultural elements in terms of fashion, events that occur in the show, and even avant-garde artistic expression. If you wonder what the name ""Urusei Yatsura"" even means, it means ""Those Obnoxious Aliens"" 
The animation in Urusei Yatsura itself needs to be excused from grading, this was an 80's anime, so don't expect the greatest animation in Urusei Yatsura, for an 80's anime... The animation is not terrible by all means, yeah it's a little dated but some people might even appreciate the old-school animation that Urusei Yatsura has to offer. 
The music by... Anzai Fumitaka (not a big composer for anime) is okay for Urusei Yatsura but also is appropriate for the show as well, the music isn't at all fantastic and it's not even impressive or even worth listening without the show, it contemplates the show well because the music sounds very zany which contemplates the zany plotlines for 90% of the entire show. The first opening is cute but really zany. 
The Voice acting on the other hand will be a somewhat short topic, the original Japanese cast is not bad at all. The English dub of Urusei Yatsura is atrociously bad... It is so bad that they dubbed a few episodes and stopped because it was that bad. I never listened to the dub but I have read a couple sources saying that the dub was atrocious. It's also interesting to note that Michael Sinterniklaas was the English voice of Ataru (even though the dub didn't last long, he was credited as voicing Ataru in the dub). He had much better roles later in his career. To make a long story short... Urusei Yatsura is only available in subtitled form 
This show also has way too many characters but since the premise and everything that Urusei Yatsura consists of, it is excusable that there are so many characters in this anime. 
If there is one thing that still works is that this show can get really funny when you least expect it... 
This anime really blends some elements well, it has humor, action (in a humorous way), it has comedy, and it has family dilemmas, relationship dilemmas, friendship dilemmas, Japanese cultural references. We can all say that the anime adaptation of Urusei Yatsura has led to Rumiko Takahashi's success and led her to make later titles that most of us already know. Let's face it, she's a very talented Manga artist, and she also makes most of her characters lovable. 
It's also interesting to note that Mamoru Oshii was the director of this anime for Seasons 1 through 8 (The First episode through Episode 106), if you don't know who Oshii-san is, let me give you a hint... Does the anime film Ghost in the Shell ring a bell? Kazuo Yamazaki takes Oshii-san's place for the remainder of the series 
The biggest question is... will everyone like Urusei Yatsura once they see it? the best answer I can give is... it all depends on what the viewer likes in their anime. On a critical note. This is an influential anime even though some people overlook this fact sometimes. 
Urusei Yatsura was available by AnimEigo and it is so out of print, it is also a hard anime to find DVD volumes of. The manga from Rumiko Takahashi was available by Viz Media and unfortunately the manga was cancelled in the U.S. (apparently due to low sales in the U.S. and only 9 volumes of the manga were released in the U.S.) There are several movies and OVA's based off the series and they are also were available by AnimEigo and they are also out of print as well, The second movie called ""Beautiful Dreamer"" was from Central Park Media and the only Urusei Yatsura release not to be licensed in the US by AnimEigo, that movie is also out of print. 
With that said, Urusei Yatsura is a one of a kind classic anime series, it may not be for everybody and I was originally going to not give a rating for this show since I thought that this show can be graded on any number. But since it is considered an influential anime at its time, I really had to think that this was a big show for Japan for the time it came out. This may have not been a big hit in the US and it probably doesn't have to be. But for its influence in animes to come at the time. 
I give Urusei Yatsura a 10 out of 10. In a way... It is a MASTERPIECE! 
Feel free to leave a comment, and guys... beware of aliens wearing tiger-striped bikinis

    This was my very first anime, which I began watching in the early summer of 1983. I figured it would be appropriate to post this here, since this marks my 30th year of anime. I'm fairly certain I was one of the only kids in the States in the early 80's who knew that Japan also made cartoons...oh crap...does that make me some kind of anime hipster?! *sigh* Anyhoo, I'm a huge fan of Rumiko Takahashi, and I'm quite happy that she introduced me into a wild world of fantasy, fun, romance and amazing storytelling. Kudos.

    I know this is going to sound like epic hyperbole, but please bear with me in the course of this review. My life has been subjected to a number of happy coincidences, so crazy in their randomness and so profound and wonderful in their effects. One of them was the one-in-a-million chance in which I met my girlfriend (we kinda ""met cute,"" and now we're preparing to live together), and another was a chance meeting during one summer with someone who would go on to become my first full-time employer, a great help in getting into law school, and a treasured personal mentor. 
Chancing upon AND deciding to give Urusei Yatsura - Those Obnoxious Aliens - was just another such astronomical, happy coincidence. Again, I don't mean to make it sound so overly dramatic, but when I found it randomly flipping through AniDb.net, I was strongly tempted to shrug and move on. I had been serially burning through anime and manga series for over a year, and I needed a real diamond in the rough to rekindle my interest in Japanese media. 
I don't remember what ultimately pushed me to go ahead and actually watch my first episode, but that first episode was all I needed to get hooked. I loved the satirical, esoteric Japanese humor. I felt like I was watching a Japanese Simpsons, and somehow I feel like I've learned quite a bit about classical Japanese culture despite never having taken a class, and surely more than I've felt I learned from previous series. I also loved the general tone of the series, especially in the first hundred or so episodes (directed by Mamoru Oshii), because it reminded me of American cartoons from the '50s and '60s if they had been willing to be a little more daring with their bawdy and scatalogical humor. 
There's a WHOLE ton of stuff I want to say about this series that could span volumes, but I want to make this review relatively brief, so I will simply say that if you want a more in-depth breaking down of my thoughts on UY, please check out my blog, which has a link to my OTHER blog, where I've written a full review. But why, if I've already written that, would I write a review here? Well, there were a couple of thoughts I left out while writing that one, because I was only about 1/6th of the way through the series at the time. Now I'm done with the TV series proper and working on the OVAs and the last couple movies, and I have a few new observations I want to share now that I've seen all 195 episodes. 
Man, 195 episodes. The only show I've ever watched that was even AS long was Friends, and no cartoon series I've watched ever came close! So suffice it to say that my life for an entire month has consisted of Ataru, Lum, Shinobu, Mendou, and the rest of the wacky denizens of Tomobiki. Having finished the series, now more than ever I can say that the characters actually are the strongest factor the show has going for it, despite what many may say about the lack of character development. For a series that totally screwed around with the chronology of the original manga, they manage to flesh out and grow the characters to a surprising degree, all while maintaining at least a loose semblance of chronological progression. And although I hated troublemakers like Lum's cousin Ten or her rival Ran - at first - I was amazed to find that by the end, they had all grown on me. As much as I groaned at how creepy and cruel Megane and Lum's Stormtroopers were in the beginning, I now consider them some of my favorite characters in the entire series. They are hilarious, and UY would not be the same without them, just as much as can be said for its two leads. 
I mentioned in my blog review that one of UY's strong selling points with me was the art style. It's not always consistent (although it does get consistently better over the years), but I found it refreshing, and now that I'm done I can say this with even more certainty. I love shows like Clannad, Haruhi Suzumiya, and Shining Tears x Wind, but I feel like anime art styles have become increasingly homogenous since the '90s. UY's art style grabbed me immediately because it reminded me of the original Dragon Ball, a very nostalgic series for me and among my all-time favorites. And I was not disappointed; from the silly to the epic, the animators proved themselves very versatile, but also very fresh (probably why they burned out towards the end though). If you need a break from modern anime (and don't get me wrong, 99% of my favorite anime was from the last decade or so), I urge you to try an episode or two. 
Also fascinating, now that I've seen the entirety of the main series, is I've realized what a seminal work this is. I know they didn't pull things out of thin air and I'm sure even the original source material was building off of old tropes, but since finishing the main body of the series, I took a break from UY to sample a couple of more recent shows. I nearly died of surprise and amusement as I realized just how many modern anime tropes stemmed from characters, plots, and situations implemented in UY. The ridiculously wealthy family with its own private army and a property containing half of Japan? The Mendou clan. (Semi-)ecchi harem comedy? Willful harem seeker Ataru and every attractive female in the known universe. Magical girlfriend? Why, Lum of course. Moe and tsundere traits in a female lead? Lum again. Bishounen played for laughs? Mendou Shutaro and Ataru both have their moments. It's also very cool to see what I imagine are some older tropes that fell out of fashion after the period during which this series had its run. It's kinda like watching an old time movie, where you can get a sense for an entirely different set of cultural circumstances because the stuff they're making fun of is hardly mentioned in contemporary series. 
Don't get me wrong; this series is not perfect, and not always totally enjoyable. One thing I got tired of pretty early on was the music. Not that the music was bad or anything, and actually there was quite a bit of variety, but that variety is almost for naught considering how many episodes they stretch them out for. Maybe that indicates it's more a symptom of the series being extremely long than anything to do with the music, but take it as you will. There are also definitely points (and unfortunately sometimes streaks) at which the episodes do drag on, because the humor doesn't work or it feels incongruent, or hey, maybe you're tired of Ataru giving Lum sh*t or Lum putting up with his sh*t. Luckily these are usually followed by marathons of episodes that are leagues better, and on the whole I would say UY's enjoyment factor and overall worth is greater than the sum of its parts. It's an experience I will never forget, and to which I hope to return again and again. 
Thank you for reading my review. Please, please watch this series. As another reviewer said, it's a crying shame that otherwise open-minded anime lovers and general lovers of entertainment will pass on this one just because it's older. The modern stuff is great and is sure to get better with time, but classics like these deserve to be remembered and treasured, because 'classic' is a title well-deserved for Urusei Yatsura. Happy (girl) hunting!

    Omfg... Some people are just so fidgety. 
This is the most underrated anime of all time. I cannot believe I did not see it until 2016. This review is for people who have watched and appreciate the show and people who cannot get into a show without a long descriptive review, so here goes! 
Starting off, Urusei Yatsura got me back into Anime after a long hiatus of not watching due to Toonami/Adult Swim's absolutely shitty selection of anime back in 2010ish (I was only KINDA watching Inuyasha at that point, Urusei Yatsura made me re-watch/re-appreciate Inuyasha). After it had a minor popularity spark in 2015-16 due to vaporwave I decided to give it a watch. After the first few episodes I thought to myself ""Eh, this is alright. The concept is kinda good and the animation is impressive for the 80's, but Idk how someone can watch this all the way through"". But then I got bored and watched a few more episodes, and then a few more, and then some more until I was like 50 eps in and could not get up off the floor from laughter. The show is so effin clever and even though the dub was treacherously despicable (and almost ruined it for me), I thought the sub was UNSTOPPABLE for us Americans. THIS is the type of humor we like: A truthful, honest, yet perfectly-exaggerated show about relationships (harem) that did not follow the average guidelines of an anime show at the time. Rumiko Takahashi took a real leap here considering it was her first anime, but the manga got so much attention that she had to make the show. But the fact that she was brave enough to do such unimaginable animations and such weird, weird concepts such as these in the 80's is MINDBLOWING. 
First the story. This is a show about earth post alien-interaction meaning that: it is not so strange to them that various phenomena such as aliens and spirits invade their daily lives. She made this so realistic that she in-fact created alien-races (including the human race) with meaningful, important backstories that play a big role in the overall story itself. It has all kinds of love triangles, guys chasing girls, girls chasing guys, family-issues, friend-issues and all of the interactions are some of the most realistic cause/effect situations in all of anime. I feel like for a lot of anime shows you would be like ""Why didn't he just do this to stop the bad guy? It was right there"" or ""That doesn't make any sense, that would never happen in real life"" NO! Not in Urusei Yatsura. If you watch all the way through, no matter how silly, all your questions are answered and everything kinda falls into place regardless of how weird it gets. In other words, it makes sense why everything on the show is happening. It seems the way that Rumiko Created this show follows physics (exceptions: dying) and the rules of life and love (especially love) except that it's in a possible FUTURE! If you don't think that is a cool concept, then you are just simply wrong. (lol) 
(BTW this is only for the show! I watched the first movie only because I had a gf back then and I dared not watch any more because it was much more fun to watch the movie with her, for they are a lot more serious and deep) (super deep) 
On to art (sry that took so long). Ok just go on Google Images and search Urusei Yatsura. Ok pretty cool right? Now search each character individually. There is so much Rumiko art and fan-art out there because the way the show is drawn is GORGEOUS. Everything's so shiny and perfectly shaped. The colors are outstanding and the animating is far beyond its time. Remember, this is the woman who brought you the masterpiece of Inuyasha, so obviously she had some practice on her early shows from the 80s. The backgrounds, the proportions. They are all so impressive especially considering that she and her artists had to draw *ahem*: Giant alien spaceships, war planes, planets, galaxies, dance scenes, ghosts/spirits, computers, fat guys, short guys, tiny people, fashionable clothing, sexy girls in bikinis, built guys in tight shorts, flying chicks, little baby dude, giant alien overlords, the list NEVER ENDSSSSSSS!!!!! Every episode is unpredictable and you never know what you will be presented with. And the eyes. Jesus, those eyes on every character are just beautiful perfection. Those alone could have gotten a 10 (But a show about a bunch of eyes talking to eachother probably wasn't the best idea, so Rumiko is smart for not doing that) 
Every character is amazing, especially Lum. Lum almost makes the show because of that god damn personality. It's not perfect, but it's bae. Rumiko literally made every dude fall in love with her on and off the show (literally) and so it ended up playing out really well because it almost kinda sorta gives you like... a gf if you don't have one! Or at least the fun/troubles of having one, you know? Regardless, even though Lum carries, the rest of the characters are hysterical and well-thought out especially: Ataru, Mendou, Shinobu, Cherry, Sakura, the parents, the other students, Ben-Ten, Oyuki, the list goes on... 
I was going to give this a 9 and then I just gave a listen to the first theme song once more. There is no way I can give the shows sound lower than a 10. The 80s and 90s did not have the best music, but this show's was CRAZY! Even in 2017! It's all loopy and synthy just the way us 2017ians like it! It fits the show oh so perfectly, and theme songs are just TOO catchy (fair warning, you may find yourself singing one of the songs for the rest of the w̶e̶e̶k̶ m̶o̶n̶t̶h̶ life.) The voices (and again, this is STRICTLY for the subbed version, the dubbed version doesn't exist to me) are spot on for every character. All of the girl and guys voice acting was done so naturally and preciously. I love it. 
Enjoyment. If you are looking for an anime that is as laugh-out-loud funny as say Two and a Half Men, How I Met Your Mother, or Family Guy then please lower your expectations because there are honestly barely any out there... But this happens to be one of them. The humor is just so gosh darn ludicrous (in all of Takahshi's shows including Ranma and Inuyasha) that you will find yourself rolling on the floor, saying to yourself ""that is SOOO true"", and by the end of an episode you are almost guaranteed to have a smile on your face. Plus it is so cute! And if that's not what you are into it's also really fricken cool and badass. You will enjoy this if you want to see anime taken to it's all-inspiring limits and yet be so elegantly simple at the same time. You will not like this if you hate fun, SLIGHTLY-broken storylines (barely fr), and anime. (How could you not like this if you like anime? No seriously, dm me and I will add it because I cannot think of anything else) 
This show is such a good time and SO easy to get into. It brought me hope when I thought there were no good anime comedies (again, dm me if you have sum) and when I felt lonely and depressed. It taught me that being kinda weird and weird things happening is all just normal in the end! It's all just a part of life, and I think that is how Rumiko wanted to portray her first anime.  I wish she brought it back, I watched the Obstacle Course Swim Meet episode and YA it wasn't as good, but she's just a little rusty!!! And besides, the animation and art and humor are still there in it, so it is possible if she wanted to! with a little more popularity and luck we might one day get just that. I hope so because I never want it to end. It is my favorite anime. It is better than Inuyasha, Dragon Ball Z, all of the Hayao Miyazaki films, and stands out the most when I think the word anime. In conclusion, easiest 10/10 on MAL and possibly my favorite show ever.

    Omg this show needs a remaster or a reboot, it's so good, the animation, the expressions, and the humour are amazing.  
None of that modern weird moe shit that's all too common in anime nowadays .  
This is one of the best animes ever made, and probably the first ever rom-com haremish romance comedy ever made. Masterpiece. 
This deserves nothing short of a 10/10 Legendary Edition 
If you're wondering why I gave this anime a 10/10 then let me tell you that this is the funniest anime I've ever seen and any anime that can be this consistently funny over 195 episodes deserves to be called a masterpiece. I promise you, ever other romance anime you watch nowadays, will A)Not be as cute B)Have bland, boring and sometimes outright retarded characters and C)Not funny, and just boring as fuck, after you have watched Urusei Yatsura. The first few eps are a bit of an 8/10 or so as they are just there to set the characters in motion, shit really gets weird and psychological unexpectedly after ep 150, no spoilers tho you gotta watch all the episodes. ONE THING I WILL SAY THOUGH IS THAT: DO NOT BINGE/MARATHON THIS ANIME, maybe 2-4 eps max a day, thats it, no more, or else you're just mindlessly consuming it, which does not do it justice.  
***I also just wanted to add, it's funny how an anime made during the 1980s somehow looks, sounds(OMG THIS SHOW HAS ONE OF THE BEST OPENING AND CLOSING SONGS) and touches you emotions more than anime made these days(Not including KIMI NO NAWA because it's absolutely amazing and gorgeous!). All the characters look more mature, and act more mature, there's no moe shit, or tiny 9 year old girls dressed in kinky outfits, none of that fucked up retarded shit. This is just straight a great ALL ROUNDER anime, it's got everything you want, and all the episodes you want, could I have asked for anything more perfect? 
Characters 10/10  
It's the characters that truly make this anime great as they all just do their jobs so well.  
Ataru: What I love most about Ataru is how I have nothing nice to say about him. There are a lot of other anime with characters who are perverts, but normally these characters have some redeeming quality to them that makes up for their perversion. Ataru has no redeeming quality. He is selfish, greedy, immoral, he'll flirt with other women while on a date with Lum, and he'll even flirt with Lum's mother right in front of her! 
But don't worry because Ataru doesn't go unpunished. Ataru has been shot, electrocuted, exploded, incinerated, crushed, and tortured in every way imaginable, but it doesn't stop him. Ataru can be electrocuted and then two seconds later be back up ""girl hunting"" again only to be electrocuted yet again!  
That brings me to the second thing I love about Ataru is how persistent he is. There's an episode where Lum leaves Ataru alone and for five straight days and nights Ataru did nothing, but ""girl hunt"". Ataru is simply unstoppable. He's more than just a pervert; he's like some kind of demon sent from Hell to terrorize women and it's hilarious every time he gets punished for it. 
Lum: What I love most about Lum is her devotion to Ataru. No matter often Ataru cheats on her, Lum still holds out hope that someday Ataru will change for the better and love her back. However, this doesn't mean Lum doesn't electrocute Ataru or hits him with a hammer each time he even looks at another women.  
However, Lum can be devious as well. There are several episodes where Lum either tries to brainwash Ataru into loving her or forces him to taking her on a date.  
Some other really funny characters: 
Shinobu - who gets super strength whenever she gets mad which happens whenever Ataru flirts with her 
Mr. Onsen - their teacher who they torture for just doing his job 
Cherry - a monk that appears form nowhere and makes whatever situation they're in worse 
Ran - whose constantly trying to make Lum's life miserable as part of her revenge against Lum 
Mendou - Ataru's rival that always tries to decapitate Ataru whenever he sees him 
Story 9/10 
What I love about the story for this show is how unpredictable it is. For example, there's an episode where Mendou turns into a woman, Ataru gets swallowed by a giant amoeba, and Adam & Eve make an appearance all in the same episode! Also, it's funny how some episodes didn't really have a solution to their problem like the characters would just be like ""this is life now"" and somehow everything is back to normal in the next episode.  
Furthermore, I really love how fast paced this show is. There was very little space between jokes and almost every joke is funny. It's really one of those shows that you watch when you want to laugh.  
Sound 10/10 
The voice acting was good, but what I really love is this songs in this anime. I really like 80's music so I of coursed enjoyed the soundtrack for this show, but more importantly it's funny how almost every song in the show is about love and how much Lum loves Ataru. That is hilarious considering just how messed up their relationship is!  
Overall 10/10 
Lum and Ataru are either the worst or the best couple ever. Ataru constantly cheats on Lum, but Lum always holds out hope Ataru will love her someday. At the same time, however, Ataru does love Lum and would never leave her, but he's such a pervert that he can't stop ""girl hunting"". In a lot of ways, Lum and Ataru are perfect for each other.  
These are some of the funniest characters I have ever seen living in a random story with 80's era animation and sound. 
I love Those Obnoxious Aliens :)    <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

    Long series can live or die on the strength of their cast, and Urusei Yatsura has one of the best around. Provided you have the patience to sit through the first twenty episodes, and the endurance to remain interested for the last one hundred and seventy five of them. It's going to take a lot of resilience and nobody is going to blame you for giving up before the end. Yet this series is a highly influential classic and the least you could do is indulge in it a little, even if it's only as an introduction before preceding to the second movie spin-off, the seminal 'Beautiful Dreamer'. 
Urusei Yatsura is the story of a lecherous high school student called Ataru Moroboshi and his alien wife, Lum Invader. The partnership is less than mutual though because while Ataru does care for Lum and even finds her attractive, he is unwilling to settle for her alone. He also struggles with commitment, starting to lose interest in Lum as soon as she starts returning his advances. He's a bit of an archetype, clearly the inspiration behind many a leading harem character. But while many of those characters are 'innocent' or 'naive' young men who find themselves wandering or collapsing on top of perverse situations, Ataru actually seeks these out. What this costs in the audience's sympathy is more than made up for in laughs. We can even respect him more than most harem leads simply because he isn't an utterly spineless git. 
His spouse, while a weaker character, is an even bigger anime icon. Even anime fans who've never heard of Urusei Yatsura are likely to have seen Lum Invader portrayed or referenced somewhere along the line. If you ever catch a character in a tigerstripe bikini with horns or green hair, it's a nudge to Urusei Yatsura's leading lady. She is sometimes said to be the original tsundere, and although that term has become whittled down almost to a formula at this point, in Lum's day a tsundere personality still came across as human instead of robotic. Unfortunately she retains a number of character flaws common in female anime characters: particularly her excessive doting on Ataru even though he does not treat her with much respect. The premise of the show is dependent on this, but even so all the best episodes are those which deviate from it: either by dealing with an entirely separate matter, or in the rare moments where Ataru's feelings for Lum are central to the plot. 
Before Ataru met Lum, he had been dating a girl called Shinobu. In contrast to the docility of Lum, Shinobu is an aggressive girl with an incendiary temper. Earlier episodes focus on Ataru's efforts to continue his relationship with Shinobu, but after some time she finds a new boyfriend: Mendou Shutaro. The eldest son of an exorbitantly rich family, he demands respect at all times even though his behaviour seldom warrants it. Mendou is the strongest member of the cast. Things are never truly 'funny' until his character is introduced, and most of the series humour is derived from his rivalry with Ataru. His vast wealth also provides the opportunity to introduce some ridiculous elements into the show, like his family's private army and castle. It also creates a bit of satire, since for all his pretentions, Mendou is every bit as common as Ataru is. And at least Ataru is aware of his own disgraceful behaviour. 
These are the four leading cast members, but there are many more great characters in the show. Mr and Mrs Moroboshi, who Ataru causes little else but grief, are a good example. Ataru's mother in particular has always got a scathing comment to make about her disappointing son. At other times, Ataru's classmates are brought to the forefront. These are young men who are so dedicated to Lum's happiness, that they force Ataru to continue dating her even though they are in love with her themselves. This is to say nothing of the wide variety of alien characters included. Altogether, they make one of the strongest casts in anime and one would have to look at The Simpsons or King of the Hill to find anything that comes close.  
But what makes the series difficult to sit through if the cast is so good? There are several reasons. Each episode has a self-contained story and the characters develop very slowly throughout the series. This is perfect for just dipping into every once in a while, as you would if you were watching it on television, but doesn't work so well when you watch a few episodes back to back. It soon starts to become a struggle not to get bored with the lack of progress in the story. This problem is acute in the earlier episodes, which are each split into two separate stories, placing even greater limitations on what any individual story can achieve. However these earlier episodes do have one benefit, which is they allow the creators to introduce most of the very large cast relatively quickly. It is not until around episode twenty, when this split episode structure is abandoned and  longer episode format is used that the series really begins to hit its stride. 
When each episode is a self contained story, it's also inevitable that some of them will be better than others. As was alluded to above, the stronger episodes tend to be those which feature the relationship between Ataru and Mendou, or Ataru and Lum as major plot elements. The weakest episodes are  those with a plot involving one-shot characters. Obviously such episodes are always without consequence and are little more than a distraction, or 'filler' if you will.  
Urusei Yatsura was made during the first half of the 1980s, with the spin off movies running all the way into the 90s. During that time period, most Japanese animation underwent a great deal of development and became significantly more ""realistic"" in terms of proportions. For example, compare the 1979 series of Mobile Suit Gundam with the 1985 Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. These two series are roughly contemporary to the start and end of Urusei Yatsura retrospectively and are both from the same series, yet they look radically different. Mobile Suit Gundam almost resembles an American cartoon, while in Zeta there has been a clear effort to make them resemble real people as closely as possible. Such a deviation in style would not seem appropriate in a single series, so improvements within Urusei Yatsura are more modest. Improvements on detail and colouring without tampering with the original, slightly cartoonish art style. 
The animation is also simplified. It's common for endless shounen series like this to feature animation that is less than stellar, and while there's nothing groundbreaking here, at least there aren't many scenes where bad animation becomes a problem. When it does stinginess is usually the cause, rather than laziness or ineptitude. Most of the errors do not really stand out, instead a few details are spared when perhaps they shouldn't have been, or a certain sequence will feel like a cell dragged across a background rather than proper 'animation'. It could however be worse, and indeed most would be expecting worse. 
Urusei Yatsura may be visually unimpressive, but its soundtrack is spectacular. Everything from the opening and ending themes, to the background music, to the little sound effect when Lum starts flying is fantastic. The main themes are some catchy 80s pop tunes, the best of which is technically not from the TV series. The main theme of UY Movie 2: Beautiful Dreamer is ""Ai wa Boomerang"" and it's a thumping pop tune with a slightly melancholic tone, and I often sing it while showering. The background music and the sound effects all work from a similar palette which complements the series perfectly, capturing the sci-fi wackiness of it all by referencing older science fiction shows like Doctor Who and Star Trek. 
Unfortunately there is only so much a good soundtrack can redeem an often enjoyable but overlong and at times slightly tedious anime. Some episodes of Urusei Yatsura are comedy gold, but many of them are just a bit too boring to stomach for long. B nobody said that you must watch all of it, and there's little point in denying yourself something good because of any unhealthy obsession with completing everything you start. Anime is a bit like gambling: you should stop when the fun stops. 
And if you're still feel unsure about starting this show, keep in mind that Urusei Yatsura is one of the most influential anime ever made. If you do not bother to at least familiarise yourself with it, your ability to enjoy anime will suffer slightly: obvious references will escape you; old ideas will seem novel. Your understanding of this medium, which is already difficult to comprehend, will always be incomplete. You'll also be missing out on Beautiful Dreamer, one of the better anime films ever made and the 'true' directorial debut of Mamoru Oshii. Last but not least, my darling, you'll also miss out on a series which at its best, is one of the finest comedy anime ever made.

    Urusei Yatsura is my favorite anime. 
• This isn’t an easy title to achieve with how high my standards for Japanese animation have become, but Urusei Yatsura left a sublimely beautiful impression on me—so much so that I can’t even imagine any other series taking its place. As far as comedy goes, it’s not a bust-your-gut-out-laughing type of series; it’s more dry, tongue-in-cheek humor. My theory on why the BBC English dub of it was so spectacular, while the American dub flopped, was because the British excel at a more dry, witty type of humor than people in the States do.  
• Speaking of ‘obnoxious,’ the title for Urusei Yatsura is a pun. The word ‘urusei’ (うる星)— the character for ‘uru’ (うる) means ‘possible’ and ‘sei’ (星) means ‘good’ or ‘nice’—is a pun on the word ‘urusai’ (うるさい) which can be translated as ‘noisy’ or ‘annoying.’ The title was localized in English as ‘Those Obnoxious Aliens,’ but a more accurate translation would be ‘Possibly Good Aliens’ since the prefix is ‘urusei’—not ‘urusai.’ The title really fits the mood of the series, all of the cast members have a fixation or fatal flaw that ails them in some way or another, which leads to the the screen being flooded with devilishly fun chaos. 
• The protagonist of the story, Ataru Moroboshi, is a diehard skirt-chaser. Despite already having a girlfriend (Shinobu Miyake), Ataru flirts with every girl in town. One day, aliens (the ‘Oni’) wage an intergalactic war on Earth and give them the chance for reconciliation—via competing with their princess, Lum Invader. Of all people, Ataru is randomly selected to compete against her. Ataru plays dirty, by ripping off Lum’s bikini top, and ends up winning. Shinobu had promised that she would marry him if he won against Lum, so Ataru begins cheering about he and Shinobu’s engagement but Lum interprets this as him wanting to marry HER, and accepts the proposal on live television. This turns into Lum’s alien overlord father forcing them together and Shinobu dumping Ataru because she misunderstood what had happened. 
• Initially, Shinobu was supposed to be the deuteragonist but because of Lum’s popularity (due to her iconic, bishōjo design)—Rumiko Takahashi’s editors made her make Lum the main heroine, instead of Shinobu! Learning from her past failure with making her heroine’s rival too popular, Takahashi reincorporated the Shinobu character into Akane Tendō from Ranma ½ and made the Lum character, Shampoo, less likable. Lum became a cultural icon in anime and directly inspired characters such as Lala Satalin Deviluke (To LOVEる) and Yōko (*いぬかみっ!). Adhering strongly to the ‘oni’ theme, each alien is based off of some subset of traditional Eastern lore (Oyuki is a *yuki-onna, Benten refers to *Benzaiten, and Ran is a *hone-onna). 
*Inukami!—*Benzaiten is a Japanese Buddhist goddess who originated from the Hindu goddess: Saraswati. *Yuki-onna is a snow woman yōkai and *hone-onna is a yōkai that is the Japanese equivalent of a succubus. 
• Despite it being an older series, even when episodes aren’t the cream of the crop in quality, the series makes up for it tenfold in its writing, excellent voice acting, directing, and interesting atmospheric takes. Especially when it shows a certain, titular hill at night and there’s eerie music playing with a talking scarecrow. Urusei Yatsura is so imaginative, certain episodes actually feel as if they’re taking you to another world—a world far enough from familiarity to seem foreign, and yet realistic enough to appear in our plane of existence. A perfect blend of practicality and uncanny valley, similar to My Neighbor Totoro. 
• There are three episodes in the series, that take the surrealism a step further, and go inside the minds of *Ataru, *his mother (Mother Moroboshi), and *father (Father Moroboshi). During these episodes, the mystery behind Ataru’s dysfunctional family is slowly unraveled and causes the audience to heavily empathize with Ataru, often, even more than Lum. Spoilers ahead; there will be spoilers for the rest of the essay! You have been warned! It is even revealed, in one of the final scenes of Urusei Yatsura 3: Remember My Love, that Ataru loves Lum infinitely more than Lum loves him but he’s too afraid to outwardly show it.  
*Episode 78: Mijime! Ai to Sasurai no Haha!? (Pitiful! Mother of Love and Banishment!?—Mother Moroboshi’s Freudian analysis episode), Episode 94: Tabi no Yuki Daruma Jōwa (The Story of a Traveling Snow Dharma—Ataru’s terrifying trip, reminiscent of Dickinson’s A Christmas Carol, showing the emptiness of his own desires), and Episode 177: Hoshi ni Negai wo! Ataru Ikka wa Yokubō Panikku (Wish Upon a Star! Ataru Family is Desire Panic—Father Moroboshi’s fever dream of greed and lust). 
• This series peels layers off of its characters and something small is revealed about each of them, episodically, that gradually adds a pieces to the puzzle of their psyche. Because of how subtle these revelations are and how often they are played off as comedy, I consider Urusei Yatsura to have the best character writing in all of anime. After subtle, dark revelations were shown about certain characters—I was left flabbergasted and thinking about those moments for days. 
• Although episodic, the formula of this series expects you watch it in its entirety if you want clarity on your favorite characters. That’s why, even though many people suggest Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer (as a gateway into the series), I think it’s a bad idea to start anywhere except for the beginning. My introduction to the series was a borrowed DVD of the first film, Only You, and it was difficult to enjoy the movie in the way its intended because you need to get to know that characters from the beginning. It’s like getting to know a friend for a long period of time before you can establish comfortable ‘inside jokes.’  
• Urusei Yatsura started common trends in anime, even in the fetish department. Tentacles have always been fetishized in Japan but I believe that Urusei Yatsura started the trend specifically IN ANIME. *Episode 29 has scantily clad, Lum being felt up by a giant gardenia’s tentacles. This formula would later be replicated in Dream Hunter Rem and other series. Another trope that was popularized by Urusei Yatsura was the little sister (imōto) fetish, starting with the introduction of the character Asuka, in Episode 132, who has been sheltered from society and instantly falls in love with any man that she considers a ‘brother’ because of her misgivings on the definition of the word. 
*Episode 29: Kuchinashi Yori Ai wo Komete (From the Gardenia with Love) and Episode 132: Omiai Jigoku! Yoroi Musume wa Bijo? Kaijo (Matchmaking Hell! Is the Armored Daughter a Beauty? Beast?). 
Psychological Analyses of the Urusei Yatsura cast: 
—Lum Invader: Lum is less complicated than Ataru but still has her own quips that make her a fairly interesting character to follow. Lum is a spoiled princess. She has a stable family that loves each other, an exact foil of how Ataru is with his family, and often acts as if she’s the center of the universe because of it. She’s lazy, reckless, and *will often twist the truth to get out of punishment. Lum has common sense, despite being an alien princess, and is often a *good judge of character. Unfortunately, she often misunderstands Ataru because of how well he can mask his own feelings. Lum is steadfast in her dedication to Ataru but is *not above kissing other men to make him jealous; a flagrant contradiction to her own repulsion with Ataru’s cheating—she also flirtatiously refers to Mendō by his given name (Shutarō) to make Ataru jealous, neglecting Shinobu’s feelings, and using him to get Ataru’s attention. She often makes mistakes, given her disposition as an overly playful and idealistic girl, but always has the best intentions in mind. Even if you despise people with similar flaws to her, it’s impossible to not like Lum. She tries so hard to woo Ataru that it’s hard not to feel for her. Lum’s characterization as an impure girl is even canonical—when the Kotobukiya scale figure of Lum dropped in 2014, there was a note from Rumiko Takahashi on the side of the box that said: ‘Lum meets passionate craftsman Shirahige and is filled with the latest modeling techniques and attractiveness of current figures, it is passionate, and the appearance of a pure Lum is also beautiful.’ 
*Episode 18: Hina Matsuri! Ran-chan Tōjō (Girls' Day! Introducing Ran-chan—an introduction to Lum’s childhood friend, Ran, who secretly hates her because she stole the affection of her crush, Rei), the ‘good judge of character’ bit comes from her seeing right through the charades of Shutarō and Inaba, and Episode 178: Kuchizuke Takkyūbin! Dārin Hajimete no Yakimochi!! (Kiss Courier! Darling's First Jealousy!—Lum kisses an alien frog, with the knowledge that he is actually an alien boy that she grew up with, and despite Ataru’s objections, still smooches her childhood friend in front of him). 
—Ataru Moroboshi: Ataru is the ill-fated protagonist who is a womanizer, has a horrible family life, bad grades, and is considered ugly among his peers. Not only is Ataru born on Friday the 13th, but also *Butsumetsu (仏滅), and his name Ataru (あたる) is spelled with characters that mean ‘to be struck by a falling star.’ Ataru is initially flirtatious towards Lum but immediately is repulsed when he finds out that (due to a misunderstanding) he is being forced to marry her. Ataru is most likely repulsed by Lum because her overbearing attitude reminds him of his mother, and in the aforementioned Episode 78, Mother Moroboshi reveals that she has a Freudian sexual attraction to her son, a compulsion to control his life because he’s the only reason she’s married to her unfaithful husband (who has squandered their savings on gambling and women), and, also, resentment towards Ataru because he’s the only reason that she doesn’t leave Father Moroboshi. It’s messed up! No wonder why Ataru is afraid of commitment! The only woman that he shows an open interest in settling down with is Shinobu—probably because she’s a down-to-Earth girl (no pun intended)—but has to stay with Lum because fear of the Earth being wiped out by the aliens. Throughout the series, Ataru begins to fall deeply in love with Lum but is so addled by his phobia of commitment that he refuses to admit it. This might just be Stockholm syndrome kicking in, because she electrocutes (via ‘electric lynching’) him in every episode, but Ataru’s real feelings for Lum seem genuine. Ataru is the type of person who will do something that’s moral and subvert it by acting amoral, just because he doesn’t want his façade to slip. 
*Symbolizes the day Buddha died. Considered the most unlucky day.  
—Shutarō Mendō: Basically a good-looking, wealthy version of Ataru. He’s just as much of a womanizer as Ataru is but doesn’t get punished for it because all the girls in class are attracted to him. Shutarō is in the top 2% of the world’s wealth—his family owns the police, the military, and is pretty much the governance of Japan. Mess with the Mendō clan and you’ll be barraged with soldiers and fighter jets! After Shinobu dumps Ataru, she begins dating Shutarō (naïvely creating a princely image of him in her head; in reality, Shutarō only acts the part to keep up appearances) but Shutarō only agrees to date Shinobu because he knows it will hurt Ataru. Shutarō puts on the guise of wanting to date Lum, but throughout the series, it’s implied that he only lusts after Lum because he wants to steal her from his nemesis, Ataru. The resentment he feels for him stems from that fact that he lacks the freedom Ataru has. Ataru is able to openly be a degenerate but Shutarō is forced to act like a gentleman to upkeep the image of his family’s estate. Little does he know that Ataru’s degeneracy is also an involuntary guise that he uses to protect himself from intimacy. Shutarō does not fit in with his family, in *Episode 185—the Mendō family uses all of the main cast as pawns in a death match against each other, whilst Shutarō objects and is completely repulsed by their sociopathic behavior. Shutarō’s younger sister, Ryōko, is a complete psychopath and only sees humans as things to be toyed with—even if it means killing them. When she *almost kills everyone on a gigantic Christmas tree rocket, she shows no remorse for nearly murdering them. It is implied that Ryōko has gone mad from being a *shut-in, whereas, Shutarō leads a fairly normal life because he goes to public school. Ryōko resents her brother for this and seems to get pleasure out of tormenting him; and, weirdly enough, it is implied that Shutarō reciprocates his sister’s feelings—getting overly protective when Ataru tries hit on her. Despite Shutarō being more normal than the rest of the family, he has a weird obsession with octopi and the number eight, as well as an extreme phobia of the dark—no doubt caused by the Mendō family’s sadistic nature. 
*Episode 185: Shin Shun Panikku! Mendō Ka Ningen Sugoroku Taikai (New Years Panic! Mendo Family Human Sugoroku Tournament) and Episode 79: Mendō Ke - Samā Kurisumasu (Mendo Family - Summer Christmas). Urusei Yatsura did the cute, shut-in imōto trope before Eromanga Sensei! 
—Shinobu Miyake: The most morally righteous and sensible character in the show. She comes from an upper middle class family, is good at piano, intellectually smart, and is kind to a small fox creature (namely ‘Pure Fox’), who has fallen in love with her because of her purity. Like Akane Tendō (Ranma ½), she is freakishly strong but a good person at heart. She dumps Ataru after he agrees to marry Lum (even though he technically is forced to agree to the engagement) and goes for Shutarō, oblivious to the fact that she’s attracted to him because he’s so similar to her childhood friend, Ataru. Since she’s known him so long, she knows that Ataru is a good guy (deep down) but still rages at him for being a jerkass. Unfortunately, after she breaks up with Shutarō, she ends up with another scummy guy (Inaba)—who alters reality to force her to fall in love with him. Poor Shinobu can never get a break. She’s more likable than Lum, in a lot of ways, but because of her comparative lack of screen time, you’re almost forced to sympathize with Lum more. 
*Episode 122: Kitsune no Kata Omoi Koisuredo Setsunaku... (The Fox's Hard Feelings of Painful Love..) 
—Ryūnosuke Fujinami: The progenitor to Ranma Saotome (Ranma ½), Ryūnosuke is a girl who is forced to live as a boy by her abusive father. She yearns to be a girl, but if she refers to herself as female or wears feminine clothing—her mentally-ill father will beat her up and tell her that a ‘boy shouldn’t wear girls’ clothing.’ This is played off for laughs but as the series goes on, you feel more and more sorry for Ryūnosuke’s disposition. She has been conditioned to be male for so long, that she doesn’t even know the basics of acting like a normal girl. She admires Shinobu because, by studying her from afar, she has deemed her to be the perfect example of femininity. Ryūnosuke also has no idea who her real mother is. Her father has a running gag in the series, where he tells a lengthy tale of what her biological mother was like but ends up mournfully calling out a different woman’s name every time! Ryūnosuke has extreme gender dysphoria, even though she’s technically the gender she wants to be—because her father forces her to bind her chest and wear mens’ clothing. 
• Urusei Yatsura is the only anime series that I consider to be a masterpiece. It has excellent character writing (rife with complexities and human error), great designs, the seiyū fit the characters perfectly, the humor is intelligent, and the directing was revolutionary, at the time, and even now! Urusei Yatsura is a game-changer that is full of magic and amazement for old and young minds alike. Unfortunately, Rumiko Takahashi poured all of her ingenuity into Urusei Yatsura and that originality that makes this series so special—is severely lacking in her later works. I think that creations like Ranma ½ and Inuyasha became too commercialized and Takahashi lost touch with what made her work so great to begin with. It isn’t the hollow marionettes, that mime their predecessors—but—the emotional complexity, cycles of the characters repeatedly spiraling into their own hypocrisy, and their faulty human characteristics that brought them to life! Not Ranma ½’s childish romantic fluff, or Inuyasha’s neglect of characters for grandiose world-building, nor is it Kyōkai no Rinne’s vapid amelioration of character inconsistencies that made her first manga so special. It was attention to detail, the realism, the surrealism, and the basic affection for the characters that were lovingly conveyed through their triumphs and flaws. At this time in my life, I doubt that a TV anime could ever replicate the passion put into Urusei Yatsura. And that is why I and the remnants of its diehard fanbase are so taken with this show!

    If you're wondering why I gave this anime a 10/10 then let me tell you that this is the funniest anime I've ever seen and any anime that can be this consistently funny over 195 episodes deserves to be called a masterpiece.  
Shinobu -  who gets super strength whenever she gets mad which happens whenever Ataru flirts with her 
I love Those Obnoxious Aliens :)

    If I were to recommend only ONE show for someone to watch if they were new to anime. I can't say for sure that this one would top the list, but it'd definitely be one of the candidates to hold that spot. 
This show is just one thing: 
""good, old-fashioned anime fun"" 
The show excels at being absolutely random, and absolutely outrageous at some points. It's kinda like the Simpsons but with that fun and exaggerated anime twist added to it. That's why I genuinely enjoyed watching this show, it's just made me laugh at the situations that the characters get themselves into; or what they do to each other. 
The only thing I didn't like about the show is that after you try to marathon thru the show and you watch 10-15 episodes in one sitting.. the show will probably become less enjoyable. I watched all 195 episodes, but it took me well over a year (with on-and-off periods throughout) to complete watching it all. 
Take your time with it, you'll enjoy it!

    Urusei Yatsura (Those obnoxious aliens) was an extremely popular manga and anime series that ran in Japan in the early 80s. Lately, people have been forgetting about these wonderful classics, and so I figured I'd write a review on one that I really enjoyed watching years and years ago, Urusei Yatsura. Urusei Yatsura is Rumiko Takahashi's first work to receive an anime adaptation (ahead of other classics such as Maison Ikkoku, Ranma and Inuyasha). Needless to say, Urusei Yatsura is a true classic that opened the way for future rom-com anime, and all the meanwhile is a wonderful-highly enjoyable story. 
The basic outline of the story will seem really stupid, childish, cheesy, boring and ""unorignal"" at first. But if you take into account that this story was written over 30 years ago, then you'll realize that it was the birthmark of similar stories. And if you compare the anime solely to modern-day shows, then perhaps it won't be one of the best shows you've come across, but Urusei Yatsura set the stone down for these new shows that you enjoy to be created.  
Urusei Yatsura is the comedic story of the tumultuous relationship between the Beautiful tigerskin-bikini-clad alien princess, Lum, and the Earth's most lecherous boy, Ataru Moroboshi. Ataru is a pervert whose constantly trying to  chase other girls around and Lum has to continuously bring him back into line with her raging jealous temper and tremendous jolts of electricity. But the story goes far beyond that. Urusei Yatsura covers nearly all genres, from romance to science fiction to comedy to parody to Japanese mythology to psychological. Urusei Yatsura incorporates it all into a wonderful, enjoyable story. The outline of the story is basically: The alien race is about to take over Earth, but in order to save the human race, a deal was made between the aliens and the humans. In a race, if a human [Ataru] can touch the Alien representative's horn in a race, then Earth will be saved. At first Ataru doesn't want to do the deal, and would rather have the human race extinct than actually do something he doesn't want to do... But that all changes when he sees that the Alien representative is a beautiful girl - Lum. With the idea of actually being encouraged to grab and grope the beautiful alien to reach her horns, Ataru eagerly does the race and succeeds - thanks to Shinabu, Ataru's one true love who promise to marry Ataru if he succeeded. Upon touching Lum's horns, Ataru yells in glory ""I can get married"", which causes Lum to misunderstand - thinking Ataru wants to marry her, and so the entire 175 episodes of the story begins.  
If you're looking to watch a series that intertwines many side events into one large main event, and the story is connected, then this isn't exactly the place to look. The episodes are episodic, and it jumps around all over the place. The story is honestly really random, and at times makes absolutely no sense. But so what? It was always enjoyable and hilarious to watch Ataru try to run away from Lum, Lum chase him down and a whole load of bizarre events unfold. I've seen people compare this show to the Simpsons in terms of how weird and unorderly the story is, but I'd say they have nearly nothing alike. 175 episodes of 1980s comedy-romance, how lovely right? 
The show can be characterized as character-driven, because there is no real plot. There is only characters that create a story each episode because of their love/hatred/annoyance/misunderstanding of each other. The characters are the epitome of your average stereotypical characters. Ataru being the super annoying pervert that he is. Lum being that jealous girl who doesn't want any other girl to be near the guy she loves. And blah blah blah, a whole buttload of other side characters who take their part in the large scheme of things, and then suddenly leave/disappear at some random time because the writers can do that kind of stuff. Throughout the long course of 175 episodes, Ataru and Lum's characters develop a lot-lot, and the audience starts to adjust to their characters, and instead of having a feeling of annoyance towards the characters, the audience develops a sense of bond-love-friendship-understanding with the characters which keeps the entire story not only funny, but captivating and memorable. Sure, Ataru is a pervert who is running away from a innocent, beautiful girl who purely/solely loves him. At first the audience wants him to love Lum back because Lum is so beautiful and innocent, but from Ataru's perverted point of view, why should he love someone if he doesn't actually love her? And Lum... Oh Lum, why must you always shock the poor boy just because he doesn't love you back? It's all just a misunderstanding. Stop stalking Ataru. But over the longass time of 175 episodes, all those thoughts suddenly change-evolve into something like: I love you all. All characters in Urusei Yatsura are annoying at times (like really annoying), but that helps develop their characters into characters that the audience can relate with and like - learn from their annoyance/mistakes. 175 is a lot of episodes. Yes, there are some filler-episodes that help define a character, and yes they can be quite boring at times, but that's the 1980's - long-running series for you. If the load of episodes, turns you off from the show, then poor you, that's your loss. Urusei Yatsura has a quite cast of characters throughout the 175 episodes that you should definitely watch.  
The sound and art of the show was composed/drawn in the 1980s, so it's unfair to compare it to romance-comedy-supernatural stories of today. But compare to other shows of it's time, Urusei Yatsura's art is spectacular, and the music isn't great, but isn't bad either. The music of Urusei Yatsura is more of the cute-innocent girly girl yet has a supernatural-alien pinch of sauce style. Especially the opening which is basically a high-pitched girl's voice squeaking, but it's not like an annoying squeaking sound, but more of a cute love sound. There aren't many times in the show (despite being 175 episodes) where music, soundtrack is being played during the show. The character's voicings were wondrous, I loved them, and normally I'm not a big fan of character's voices in romance stories. The character's designs were drawn up by the great, Akemi Takada who also drew the character's for the great Maison Ikkoku. It's no surprise that Lum is considered one of the most beautiful, and greatly drawn characters in anime history. Lum is in her own way unique and beautiful, and she is like a mother-figure to modern-day beautiful super-natural females. The overall art (cities, animals/aliens, characters) is really old-fashioned (reminder: 1980s) but it really added to the livliness of the entire story.  
All in all, Urusei Yatsura isn't perfect, and it most definitely isn't the greatest classic out there. But Urusei Yatsura is a trailblazer in anime history, and it remains as a mother-figure show for modern-day romance-comedies, and for those of you that have a lot of time on your hands and want to check out a true classic rom-com anime, then Urusei Yatsura is definitely the one to check out.

    Back in my ""Maison Ikkoku"" review, I mentioned that it seems that fans have a tendency to neglect some of the old classics that made the creators they love big in the first place.  Either that or they turn a blind eye to them, seeing as they're ""old"".   I'll probably get some flack for all that, but it's just so prominent in today's anime fandom that the latest things out there are ""the best anime ever"" one day, and when ""one year later"" rolls its way by and/or when the series ends, it would be a thing of the past. 
And the cycle goes on and on.   This is the way everything in the media and life is unfortunately.  But there are still series out there that can still be remembered by the vetran anime fans and are held in high esteem as being influential to many manga artists (Like ""Dragonball"" for example.  Eiichiro Oda, one of the people influenced by DB went on to make ""One Piece"", which is freakishly popular in Japan), and ""Urusei Yatsura"" is no different.  Heck, reruns of it still play on Japanese primetime and the manga gets reprinted constantly! 
The story is about Ataru Moroboshi, who, as normal as he looks, is the unluckiest and most girl-crazy being in the entire universe.  His mere existance attracts unnatural bad luck towards himself and the people around him.    
But one day, Ataru comes home to see that the leader of a race of alien oni is sitting in his  house.  It turns out that he has been randomly selected by computer to race in the major sport of the Oni's planet: the game of tag.   He's challenged to race the leader's daughter, the beautiful, tiger bikini-clad Lum.  Ataru has to chase Lum for ten days and grab her horns, or else the race of Oni aliens will take over Earth. 
This seems easy to Ataru at first...that is, until he finds that Lum can fly, taking the difficulty level way higher than he expected.  On the night before the last day, Ataru's childhood friend Shinobu promises to marry him if he is able to win.  Full of a new burst of confidence, Ataru grabs Lum's horns in the final minutes of the game and shouts, ""NOW I CAN MARRY HER!!""  Unfortunately, Lum misunderstands what he means and takes his victory cry as a marraige proposal to her, which she accepts promptly and starts calling him ""Darling"".   
At first UY may seem like another ""Love Hina"" type of anime, where the show lives to only show fan service and nudity.  Other then some little things and unexplicit nudity, the show's pretty clean, depending on which episode it is (there's only two I know of that featured nudity), but seeing the art quality and film quality making them look less detailed, I doub it'll infect anyone.  Other than that, it's nothing else than what you would see on BayWatch: four alien chicks in bikinis. 
Though it's definitely a good example of 80s anime.   Sure, it's incredibly cheezy and the kind of funny that makes you laugh because of how dumb (in a good way) the show is, but it plays like a dream.   
Another thing I might want to bring up is that some sites cite this series as a ""harem anime"".  Sure, there's a bunch of women in it and a central male loser character, but keep in mind that most of the women in UY hate Ataru.  Despite his barely controlable libido, Lum loves him no matter what.  D'awwwww. 
The story is very lighthearted and wacky, with all sorts of bizzare references to Japanese mythology and cheesy puns on the language.   The artwork is colorful and very cartoon-esqué, but the main target that the show wants is plain fun.   It creates a happy mood for the viewers and freely takes you on a random and crazy ride through all the characters.   
""Urusei Yatsura"" has probably one of the biggest casts out of Rumiko's other stories (next to ""Ranma 1/2"").  We have Lum's fire-breathing cousin Ten, who hates Ataru with a purple passion and will do whatever it takes to make Ataru look bad, Ran, a redheaded alien with a split personality, the noble Oyuki, the motorbiking Benten, and an assortment of many other weird monsters and aleins.   
There's a good balance of humans too, like Shinobu, who can come across as  sincere but can get so angry that she's able to lift ridiculously heavy objects and throw them,  Lum's fanclub at Tomobiki High, consisting of a bunch of nerds that are ready to reprehend Ataru if he commits a misdeed related to Lum, Ryuunosuke, a girl raised to be a boy by her sexist father, the rich and handsome Shuutaro Mendou, and Ataru's (REALLY) whiney parents who do hardly anything but mourn that the wish they never had Ataru.   
Take all these characters and put them in a regular environment, and it's one wacky romance-comedy thoughout all 195 TV episodes, 4 movies, and 6 OVAs.    
But one thing that can strike someone funny is Ataru's character.  He's a far cry from the meek yet determined Yusaku Godai, and Ranma Saotome and Inuyasha, who are characterized with bravery and great fighting skills.   
 However, as much of an idiot and a pervert that Ataru makes himself out to be, he's actually a very caring person, and an intelligent one at that.  His legendary bad luck and resistence to injury has convinced him to be otherwise  and that's the reason why he acts the way he does.  And as much as he dismisses it, he truly loves Lum as much as she loves him.      
With a strong amount of sotries and characters, along with loads of laughs and catchy songs and BGM, ""Urusei Yatsura"" is an anime that is particularly hard series to get bored of.

    As a general rule, people usually forget what has come before.  For anime fans, particularly those who aren’t Japanese, this is all too often the case as new shows are hailed as the best ever, groundbreaking, or original while completely ignoring what influenced them in the first place.  Urusei Yatsura may not be (it's not) the greatest series in the history of anime but it ranks right up there in the top five most influential of all time.   
Urusei Yatsura is the first of Rumiko Takahashi's work to receive an anime adaptation.  It centers on what is today a tried and true anime concept, a beautiful alien girl, Lum, falls in love with a rather ordinary and none to bright boy, Ataru.  While this may or may not have been the first time this had ever been put to film, you can be sure this was the first time it was done so successfully and thus spawning decades of future imitators.  Add in a cast of gorgeous girls and other zany and outrageous characters and a memorably stupid and lecherous leading man, you have the framework for an amusing series. 
However for modern fans a few things that are missing from the show will likely effect their overall enjoyment.  For starters, Urusei is almost a completely episodic anime with absolutely nothing in regards to an overriding storyline.  Once characters have been introduced into the series canon they change little if at all.  Because of the nature of this format it makes many of the episodes completely predictable and annoyingly repetitive.  A basic episode revolves around Ataru chasing girls, Lum becoming angry, followed by Lum electrocuting him.  Additionally quite a few characters are nauseatingly annoying or generally grate on your nerves and outstay their welcome. 
All that being said, when Urusei Yatsura is good, it’s REALLY good.  But any viewer determined to take the leap into this series would be wise to savor it slowly over time.  Over the several years I spent watching this series I found a few episodes at a time was the best I could manage in any given sitting.  I would suggest that pace for anyone as well.  If you are interested at all in the history of anime, UY should be near the top of your list.  While most fans may not be familiar with most if not all of its characters, everyone is familiar with them as they live on today after being pioneered in this series. 
The alien girl Lum remains today even thirty years later as one of the most iconic figures of anime.  It’s pretty much impossible to dislike Lum.  Most people think of her as a tsundere type character but she’s not.  Lum is honest with her feelings and incredibly jealous.  Add her electrocuting powers, she makes for a girl I don’t think any man with a brain would dare defy or cheat on.  Since Ataru is an idiot he doesn't ever learn though.  Despite her jealousy and frequent use of her power she never comes across as a bully or a bitch.  More often than not you find yourself feeling a little sorry for her that she has fallen for such an unfaithful and idiotic man.  Love is blind they say... 
For Ataru, he is an unrepentant louse and womanizer in addition to being a complete idiot.  You might think that because of his personality that he would not be a likable character either but that’s not the case at all.  Despite his odious character defects he remains a charming and likable character throughout the series.  Whether you just like his antics or like watching him in pain or being punished.  While it becomes obvious that Ataru really does care for Lum, his womanizing and rejection of Lum's advances seem to be out of a desire to not be tied down or in liking being chased.  Even though he is completely and totally unsuccessful in wooing any woman other than Lum he never seems to give up. 
The supporting cast is enormous, as one would expect from a series of this length.  The results are mixed.  Because many characters have extreme personalities I often found that they became annoying if they were featured too often.  Shinobu starts as Ataru's girlfriend and vies for his affections in the early parts of the series.  She is one of the rare exceptions to change over the course of the series.  I was glad to see her not pine over Ataru for the entire series though she took a rather strange turn from being an ordinary Japanese girl to being a super strong girl.  Mendou also shines as the super rich boy who is adored by all the girls, except the one he most wants (Lum).  But in actuality he is just as much of a womanizer as Ataru is.  He makes for an excellent foil.  Others like Jariten, Ran, and Megane are generally amusing but tend to get on your nerves if they get too much screen time.  Cherry and Ryuunosuke's father are ALWAYS annoying and generally made me swing from the desire to punch a hole through my television and projectile vomiting. 
From an artistic standpoint, due to its success it’s likely to have influenced character designs for an entire generation and eventually lead to what we have today.  I think you can probably trace the origins of ""moe"" back to at least this series as the thin, lanky, and elegant body types of the 70's give way to younger, chubbier, and cuter looking ones.  Despite its age though and the peculiarities of animation from this era its still looks fabulous.  The characters are extremely expressive and have enough dissimilarity that they are easily distinguishable from each other, with only a few exceptions.  
The seiyuu performances are first rate and each brings out their characters to perfection.  Whether it be Lum's anger or Ataru's perverted giggling you can’t help but be drawn into Urusei's universe.  The series features many different OP/ED themes that vary from your standard J-Poppy tunes that wouldn't be that out of place today and the very dated engrish disco tracks.  It’s old enough now that you may just have some 80s nostalgia. 
I my opinion everyone should give this series a watch.  While it certainly isn't an easy viewing experience, getting through it will give you an appreciation for the history of animation in Japan and an insight on Japanese pop culture.  Not to mention it's also pretty damn funny.

    There are going to be some spoilers of the movie in this review, so be warned 
Gundam. The name barely requires any introduction, this monstrosity of a franchise, that has been kept itself relevant throughout almost 40 years, and in present times has, as far as I know 3 currently airing series. This film occupies a special place in this monomith, being an attempt to finally get the satisfying and conclusive resolution to elements from 3 previous seasons, especially the legendary rivalry between the franchise most popular and beloved characters, char aznable and amuro ray. The successes and failures of this movie is what I will be discussing at length in this review. 
Let me start with the aspects that definitely did not work. Its introduction of new characters and said character plotlines. I could put a lot of effort and talk about each new main character in detail, but it would make no difference, the truth is all new character sucked. Like really weak motivations that constantly change for no reason, barely any personality, completely irrational in their decision making process making they look dumb as fuck, no chemistry or interesting interactions those guys complete the checklist for bad character writing. That would not be that much of a problem, if the movie did not spend an insane amount of time trying and failing to stablish this characters, and how this character by the end of the story barely achieved anything meaningful mostly serving to die in anticlimactic ways. Talk about a complete waste of time. 
From its worst to its best aspect, the visual presentation in this movie is spectacular second best looking 80s tv show I have ever seen. And when the first place is akira be sure this not little praise. Past gundam series like zeta have this distinct high quality for its time animation, but the movie one ups all previous installements in the series in that regard. The battle sequences are in general breathtaking, from its memorable mech designs, its attention to detail, fluidity and dynamism of movement, it was all on point in this movie. I also really dig the character designs; such hyper realistic style really suits gundam the best. 
The clash between amuro and char is the most important and perhaps most divisive aspect being really a mixed bag in general. The direction they decided to take char in this movie is criticized by lots of fans a comprehensible perspective. A lot of things in regards to char’ character, especially in his ideals and the way of achieving his goals, none of the events and what lead him to change to his mind is ever openly shown to the audience. But there are several hints that explain what happened to him. The show heavily implies that the burden of finally assuming and taking his heritage as the leader of Zeon, after finally following the footsteps of his father he feels both obligated by his father memory and to his duty as a son, to prove and finally act upon his father’s ideals, such desire, is what finally makes him, abandons the passivity he showed at zeta and his general unwillingness to commit and be a major agent in the evolution of mankind. A believable and even understandable in my ways development for the character. This war is not only ideological for char though, he has a personal reason to be invested in this conflict, his other desire is to finally enact revenge towards amuro to the point he himself sometime questions if that is not the more important reason for whole thing. Although a little more showing would be better char’s character and final resolution completely works in this movie. I wish I could say the same for amuro. Not much about his character is actually revealed, his motivations besides his pacifism are fairly obscure, important topics like what char may mean to him are not even hinted. What we have here is a way more concrete and well realized character, fighting against one that is sadly lacking, but to be fair amuro at least intellectually challenges char, at least the clash between highly different and valid ideals about how to enact change in the world works, not only on paper but in practice. 
I am on purpose omitting the fact this movie was designed for failure. Look at how grandiose of a plot this has, with 5 main characters, 3 of which have never been established in this franchise, a complicated political backlog with several factions, and a large scale confrontation, regarding the future of mankind, and tell me was a movie length worth to do justice to all of that? No this has clear signs of being planned originally as a 13-episode series that was forcefully put as a single movie. More time could do wonders to improve the product that we got, like the aforementioned terrible characters closely reminded me of characters’ types I found in earlier entries of the franchise like zeta. And although in there the characters were also annoying the fact we got the time to know and understand those characters’ mentality, is what ultimately made those work, and the character in here to do not. I am not saying they could not have made this as a movie, it is not like there are not dozens of good ways to streamline this. 
SO would I recommend this movie? Eh…. Sure it mostly works only as a cool what if scenario regarding the insane amount of possibilities this could have, and I would be dared to call anything in this great outside of its animation quality, but heck just goes for it. Char and Amuro’s characters are a big part of what made the UC gundam so special their final moments and struggle gain importance by that alone and deserve to be seen by all gundam fans.  As all good things come to an end so did that important aspect of gundam, a shame it was not the satisfying ending it could possibly had been.

    Recipe to finish a great rivalry: 
1. Focus on the two rivals at hand. 
2. Raise the stakes for each rival higher than ever before. 
3. When the conflict is over, make sure the rivalry has a clear END. 
Is there a rivalry in Anime more storied and legendary than that of Amuro Ray and Char Aznable? A rivalry so big it could only end in a feature film. Rare thing for Anime. ""Char's Counterattack"" is the culmination of everything a Gundam fan could want in this story. The Earth in peril. Favorite characters (and new ones) in a fight for the ages. Both sides with legitimate arguments to support their cause.  
The story itself is fairly basic. Antagonist from space wants to attack and destroy the World... (Insert Raul Julia ""OF COURSE!"" here) The protagonists want to save the Earth and the countless lives on it. They do battle in space with mobile suits, etc. But it's the chess pieces on the board that make this generic story special. Amuro Ray, Bright Noah, and the Earth Federation vs. Char Aznable and Zeon. Don't get much better than that for a Gundam fan. 
The mechs themselves are pretty awesome. Nu Gundam is a superior piece of hardware with it's technological superiority and classic all-white look, it is the perfect suit for Amuro Ray. Char Aznable counters with the intimidating and (of course) all-red Sazabi, that just screams ""The Red Comet"". The rest of the mechs do well and we all get lots of that sweet, sweet, 'splosion porn.  
Sub vs. Dub is a big win for the Sub. Char and Amuro's final act can only be played out by the two who have been doing it the longest, Shuuichi Ikeda and Toru Furuya. Both actors deliver the finest performances of their careers as these characters. Art is very good for it's time and the sound effects still hold up well even today. 
As a massive Mobile Suit Gundam fan, I wasn't able to catch my breath much. And by the end credits, I was literally in tears. If there was a better ending possible for this rivalry, I certainly couldn't think of it. Gundam fans- you have to watch this (after the original and Zeta, of course). I wanted to end this review with something catchy like, ""Parting is such sweet sorrow"" or ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" but honestly, just watch the film for yourself.

    I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  I loved the original 0079 Gundam and the character of Char Aznable.  However, I did not like this movie.  Two thing i need to mention before i start the main part of this review. First of all I have NOT seen zeta or zz gundam, only the 0079. Second, IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MULTIPLE        *******SPOILERS***** SPOILERS****** SPOILERS******SPOILERS*****, you have been warned.   This movie, to me was extremely confusing and annoying.  The annoying parts of this movie largely come from the girl Quess.  Quess gets in the way of the main plot which should be centered around Char and Amuro.  She is the equivalent of Selphie from Final Fantasy 8 in Gundam except much worse.  She bitches about everything, hangs on Char's shoulder and has no purpose in this movie other than to fill time.  Time that could have been used to develop Char and Amuro.  When she dies there is no emotion and the viewer will be happy to have her gone.  The confusing parts of this movie come from an over abundance of characters who are not explained in this movie. Most of the characters might be explained in z or zz Gundam but, this movie should still be accessible to those who just want to enjoy it.  Also this movie has the most confusing and bullshit ending i have ever seen in an anime feature.  The asteroid which Char has sent on a crash course toward earth is moved away by human will power or some other magical bs and both Char and Amuro drift away into space and die.  One of them should have been the true winner of the conflict like in 0079 and the other should have died.  Instead they will both die in space with each other.... a pathetic and sad ending especially for Char...  Maybe i need to go watch z and zz Gundam then come back to this movie to better understand it.  However, i do not think even that will fix my problems with this movie ( Quess, lackluster ending). Although i will say that two good things about this movie were it art and sound which were both spectacular.  The mecha designs look great and the song at the end is good. In addition, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who is not familiar with Gundam because they will be completely lost.  I watched the original and still felt like i was way in over my head.  In conclusion, while i can see a hardcore fan of Gundam enjoying this movie, casual fans like myself and those not familiar with Gundam will not be able to enjoy or understand this movie due to its: over abundance of characters,  a mediocre plot, and a very annoying side character (Quess).  This movie was alright but could have been amazing like 0079 and i was very disappointed with it overall.  6/10

     The Mobile Suit Gundam franchise gets its first ever movie in the form of Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattck. Released back in 1988, it was directed by franchise creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino. The movie sees the return of One Year War veterans Char Aznable and Amuro Ray back in action. If you're interested in watching it, I recommend watching Mobile Suit Gundam and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam-- even Gundam ZZ, if possible-- first to get a better understanding of the plot and characters. Anyway, let's get into the review. 
 U.C. 093, six years after the events of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Char Aznable emerges from hiding. This time, he wages war against the Earth Federation with his Neo-Zeon army. Of course, Earth Federation retaliates and rival pilot and One Year War veteran, Amuro Ray, is looking to settle the score with Char for good. The story is well-told and kept me interested. However, it doesn't really explain much about what happened to Char and Amuro after Zeta Gundam and how did they get the positions that they're in. Also, it would have been nice to see characters from Zeta and ZZ such as Kamille and Judau make some form of an appearance. Nevertheless, the story is engaging and kept me hooked. 
The two main leads Amuro and Char are back and it's great seeing them duke it out again. Captain Bright Noa takes a supporting role and it's great seeing him back. New characters include Chan, mechanic and Amuro's girlfriend; Nanai, Char's second in command; Hathaway Noa, Bright's son who's caught up in the action; last and least, Quess, a green-haired Zeon pilot.  I felt that for some reason the movie wants us to focus on Hathaway and Quess for some reason. both came off as boring than interesting. Hathaway comes off as naive and irritating at times. As for Quess, she takes annoying to a whole new level. Constantly going on and on about how awesome Char is (he sure is!), she just felt unnecessary. Honestly, it would have been better if we got more Amuro and Char screen time than this. 
For a late 80's film, the production values hold-up well. The animation and designs are fits the style of the Gundam universe. Additionally, The show's main mobile suits, Amuro's Nu Gundam and Char's Sazabi are both well-detailed and are looking good. I've watched the dubbed version of the movie and I have to say, it was alright. If I recall correctly, Char's Counterattck was dubbed before Zeta Gundam, so it's natural if the voice cast sound different. The soundtrack is spot-on. A lot of the tracks fit the tension and action sequences and was a nice to listen to. 
I have been anticipating to watch Char's Counterattck for a while, and after watching it, it didn't disappoint. Despite some lack of backstory for some characters, I still found the story to be engaging. The fights were thrilling to watch and it was great seeing Amuro and Char back in action. The presentation is nice and still holds up well by today's standards. Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack is a must-watch for fans of the U.C. Gundam timeline.

    Well admired director and creator of Mobile Suit Gundam, with Bandai, Tomino brings the first Gundam film, Char’s Counterattack. If going into this without seeing the previous installments: Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta Gundam, this movie is still good, but the full enjoyment will not be there. Now, if the viewer has seen the previous Gundams, Char’s Counterattack is the best Gundam ever. 
Pacing and story are all set up well. As in with most anime movies, a proper backstory in between the past to the “present” is lacking, such as where Char has been up until now. All other characters, new and old, play important roles to the overall plot, so there is no wasted air time. Basically, this goes back to its roots with Char vs Armuro, Red mobile suit vs Gundam taking place 14 years after the original one year war. Character and costume designs are updated to make all the old characters seem more mature. For example, Char is given a more dignified muscular look. 
All art and music is top notch for 1988. It is not all militaristic as it has been in the past, but gears more towards a classic space opera type that really sets the mood across each battle. Battle scenes are choreographed amazingly well, and really match up with the music perfectly. There is never a sense of disorientation in space compared to past space mech battle seen in Votoms for example. All the mech designs maintain that gritty moving gears appeal as well. 
For the actual story, Char is an angry old war veteran who has come to the conclusion that the people in space, aka “spacenoids” will carry humanity on while the “parasites” on Earth must be rid of. His plan is to coordinate a giant meteor to crash into Earth causing all life on Earth to be “reset.” What actually happens at the end is up for interpretation. 
In the end, this is The total Gundam anime. It has everything a person wants in a mech anime except a series.

    Char's Counterattack is the 4th Gundam animation production. It's a 2 hours long movie, not a series. This movie focuses more on wrapping things up for Amuro and Char. 
Story: 8 
Story is good, it manages to do so much in just 2 hours time, though sometimes it felt a little rushed. Story is simple, Char finally got fed up with people whose souls are being tied down by Earth's gravity, and decided to make Earth inhabitable to force humanity to move to space, therefore promoting human evolution into Newtypes. The only thing that stands in his way Londo Bell, an Earth Fedration's special forces. It still shows some conflicts, and some political issues, like how Gundam series has always been, though not very much because it's only 2 hours long. Now some people said that there's a lack of back story here, we don't get any explanations on how things get the away it is. Well actually many of the back story is implied throughout the movies or in the previous series, you only need to watch carefully. All in all, the ending is the best possible conclusion to end Amuro and Char's rivalry, Tomino does a great job here. 
Art: 8 
The animation here is done well. As usual, still loses to recent works, but still done well. Mecha design is very good. Units like Nu, Sazabi, and even the grunts like Jegan and Geara Doga are nice designs. This movie has many funnel type units, like Nu, Sazabi, and the 2 Jagd Dogas. Expect a lot of funnel actions in this movie. Character design is still good, as usual. Characters from previous series can still be recognized even if they got older. 
Sound: 9 
One word for the soundtracks: Epic. Really, most of the soundtracks are very epic songs. It's quite different from the previous series. I even cried when listening to the song played at the last scene. (Hell, I even almost cried when writing this and remembered the scene.) Not much differences in the SFX thouh, still the same old Gundam SFX. 
Character: 8 
Characters are mostly good, though some side characters doesn't get enough attention, but overall it's still good. As usual, characters here is pretty much driven only by their own ideals. Which is a good thing, I like seeing characters with good ideals like Char. Tomino really made a good cast of characters. I find myself getting emotional feelings towards many characters here, whether it's like or hate. Sign of a good anime is that the characters can draw many emotional feelings from the viewers, which is what this movie did well. 
Enjoyment: 9 
An enjoyable movie for me. Though if you want to enjoy this you need to be a Gundam fan who have watched the previous series before this. Story progression is enjoyable, I can't explain much since it will just give spoilers. Mecha battle is typical UC battles: Great battles. Nu vs Sazabi is pretty much one of the most reckless battles I've ever seen. Recent Gundam works are too weapon dependent, while here they even use fists and kicks, they don't care when their weapons got destroyed, as long as the unit can still move, they'll fight. This makes a very interesting battle. 
Overall: 9 
A good conclusion to Amuro and Char's rivalry, this a very good watch for any UC Gundam fans out there. Highly recommended to watch if you have watched the previous series.

    Quick and simple: The characters other than Amuro and Char are annoying and pointless. The introduction of new characters especially the new girl drove me crazy. There simply wasn't a need for them and, in the end, no one cares about them. The story doesn't flow well but that plauged the original gundam as well and by the end it all makes sense so I guess I can say it works in a way. The most important part of the movie is the conclusion between Amuro and Char. It delivers and is worth it completely. If you are into there rivalry between them there is no doubt that you need to watch this movie. I believe it could have been far more epic if they focused more on Amuro and Char but when it did it was great. Oh yeah, also the ending is satisfying so no worries there. Watch it!

    Mobile Suit Gundam: Char’s Counterattack was created to serve as the finale in the ongoing rivalry between notable Universal Century mecha pilots Char Aznable and Amuro Ray, as the former now leads the remnants of the Neo-Zeon faction and plots to launch a meteor into the Earth to trigger an ice age on the planet in defiance of the Earth Federation. This being said, I strongly recommend viewers watch up on the older Gundam titles before watching this movie as it is made in mind for viewers who have watched through Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even Gundam ZZ. 
For the most part, Char’s Counterattack does a great job at getting into the heads of Char and Amuro as the final events leading up to their climactic battle play out. The radical motives that Char has planned for Earth may seem sudden compared to earlier depictions of his character. But considering the Gundam franchise has depicted the Earth Federation being just as corrupt as the Zeons in certain facets and the ignorance that those on Earth have to the prejudice faced by Spacenoids, it’s kind of hard not to blame Char for taking on a more jaded and cynical outlook to the ongoing conflict between Earth’s citizens and Spacenoids. The film explores the conflict between Federation and Neo-Zeon factions from both Amuro and Char’s perspective, with both clearly being weary and hostile toward one another due to their differing ideologies on the situation and being justifiable in whatever actions they choose to pursue against one another.  This makes the final fight between the two all the more satisfying as it mirrors how their final fight in the original Gundam series played out and with the film being directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, what results from the finale is very fitting after things are said and done. 
While the conflict between Char and Amuro is nice to see unfold, it does carry one major issue in the form of new character Quess Paraya. Her character appeared to be an attempt by the film to show how a child could be impacted by the perils of war. However rather than come across as a sympathetic victim, Quess comes off seeming more as a selfish, self-absorbed, and sociopathic little brat who is too obsessed with seeking romantic affections from either Amuro or Char, going so far as to try killing those who get in the way of trying to earn her affections for one of the two mecha pilots. Regrettably, her situation gets a decent amount of focus throughout the film as it takes screen time away from focusing on the main storyline of Amuro and Char’s conflict. The later release  
The visuals to Char's Counterattack amazingly still hold up rather well today for a 1980s anime film, featuring plenty of clean, smooth details and subdued color tones in creating the settings of the movie from the inside of space colonies to the intricate details inside a space battleship. This same effort also went into the designs of the Mobile Suits used among both Neo-Zeon and Londo Bell forces who engage in plenty of fluid and intense battle scenes with one another throughout this film. This is also the first title in the Gundam franchise to make use of CG animation in a brief shot of the Neo-Zeon's Sweetwater space colony. Character designs appear to be adapted from the style in which they were made from the original Gundam series yet they are better polished for this movie. The music for Char's Counterattack does its part to enhance the fierce battles taking place onscreen, as well as highlighting tense moments between characters.  
While the film does have its occasional hiccups in quality thanks to the presence of Quess, Char’s Counterattack still makes for a fitting end to the story of Char and Amuro’s rivalry within the Universal Century timeline with the film’s focus on exploring how both respond to the final conflict between Federation and Neo-Zeon forces. It’s not the best entry in the Gundam franchise, but  is still worth watching if you have watched any of the older Universal Century Gundam titles.

    I am Japanese. 
Here, I describe a background of an anime film which is not known in a foreign country. 
-------------------- 
Ⅰ-Until Char's Counterattack is made 
Tomino Yoshiyuki creates a social phenomenon by Gundam and Ideon through  
Mushi Productions era, Triton and Zanbot3. 
Gundam is the anime which followed the Science fiction. 
We should watch the fact that the televising day of Gundam[4/7/1979] is after half a year since Japanese release of Star Wars[7/1/1978]. 
Star Wars is the masterpiece with which the imagination of Hard SF and the dramaturgy of entertainment were united. 
The Eastern anime director absorbed the latest movie technique in the world 
by George Lucas. And, he added Robot design, War movie, Violence and a social satire to his work. 
By chance, This situation resembles the relation between Tezuka Osamu and Disney. 
The 80s were the Tomino Yoshiyuki era. 
By his strong influence, A lot of SF-anime and new drawing technique and various 
dramaturgy was made. moreover, the market of new media such as Original Video Animation and new plastic model culture was established. 
He made economy of rising generation anime. Tomino Yoshiyuki announced one work after another. Xabungle, L-Gaim,Dunbine, Z Gundam, ZZ Gundam... 
But, he was solitude. 
because, The makers of First Gundam were independent each and have left from him, and people did not evaluate him. 
He was going to overcome himself further. Nevertheless, he was angry to the fact that he can't get excellent creator. 
Ⅱ-A revolution called ""Char's Counterattack"" 
Char's Counterattack is the best masterpiece in Tomino Yoshiyuki's work and Japanese movie history. 
This anime is like documentary. Two Characters which exist inside him fight. and, his very destructive political awareness is reflected in this anime. 
In this story, a hero is Char Aznable. He is a military man of the enemy who was a rival  of Amuro in the first series. He mustered the remnants of Zeon army and commands the Neo-Zeon army. He does declaration of war to the Federal Government. For reasons of political corruption, he decrees human race purge and global cooling. then, he dropped the asteroid in Tibet. The independent unit ""Rond Bell"" in which Amuro belongs battles them. but, a little before, Neo Zeon captures meteorite city ""Axis"" by political negotiation. 
Char challenges the last battle with the government and Amuro now. 
Apparently, The composition of this movie is justice vs. evil. Neo Zeon of the evil which ruins the earth vs. Rond Bell of the justice which stops a meteorite. but, the actual story is very complicated. 
This movie is explanation insufficiency and unkind. Especially, I can't value the hint of  ""Phycho frame"" of second half. 
You couldn't understand this movie if you saw for the first time. because, even the Gundam fan can't understand. 
I watched to this movie 50 times. Still, can't understand completely. 
but, I can make you understand at once. why is this movie unclear? I found that reason. 
The character of this movie was telling the lie, it's Char !! 
Usually, an anime character does not tell a lie. An anime character speaks about having thought honestly. it is such staging method. but, All the anime changed staging method by this movie. 
Char despises the subordinate of one's own army and never real intention. He agonized. His true character is not known by himself. He cries for real intention in front of Amuro which killed own sweetheart. We recognize him to be a realistic human being. 
He was in despair, though he finished the revenge to Zabi family. He has a complicated thought to the dead sweetheart, Amuro, and human being. He is a hero and is a lonely man. it's two  silhouettes overlapping. 
He is a life-size character which tells a lie, has a sexual desire and cannot arrange own idea. 
A supporting role and minor characters are also the same. In a battlefield, a superman does not exist. Everyone is moving about desperately. 
The special feature of the Tomino work always has important point in a civilian's existence. Tomino designs a complicated battlefield. For example, the problem which arises between the Federal Government and Neo-Zeon is whether Neo-Zeon possesses weapons of mass destruction. Neo-Zeon gets ""Axis"" from the Federal Government on condition that surrender. And, by surprise attack, Neo-Zeon is gaining total control in the military base of the Federal Government. 
By comparison, watch also at the scene of Rond Bell. The scene of the strategy meeting in ""Ra-Cailum"", all the member's age and a race and cloths are different. 
This situation shows what kind of unit the Rond Bell is. 
A superman does not exist there. Even Amuro is a simple soldier. 
The last scene is symbolic. 
""ν-Gundam"" which pushes a meteorite ""Axis"" is nothing but a ordinary human and one machine. However, when a lot of ordinary human beings collect, ""Axis"" which is a symbol of the Char's idea is pushed back. 
I said first that this movie was Tomino's documentary. 
Tomino repeats the same theme with the past work. In this movie, two silhouette with idea of despair and ordinary human does fight. Tomino continues shooting one's own conflict dispassionately. 
Tomino showed the realism of anime and meta-fiction of self-expression. The movie challenged about the ability of the animation to show a serious theme. 
Figuratively speaking, it is ""Apocalypse Now"" of future war. 
Ⅲ-What inherits Tomino's will. -Char's counterattack and the 90s.- 
But! this movie was not evaluated! 
The misfortunes of this movie are that it is anime and a sequel to the Gundam series. Anime is strong in the optimistic impression. So, it has evolved as a children-oriented advertisement. Moreover, Gundam tends to be regarded as the genre for a robot fan. Nobody thought this anime to be a war movie. 
Although Tomino releases a masterpiece also after this, he is treated coldly. 
At last, Tomino's health broke down from mental damage. 
However, in fact, only one person had the man who understood ""Char's counterattack"". 
The name is ""Anno Hideaki"". 
He made one fanzine in the previous year when ""Evangelion"" is made. 
The name is ""Char's counterattack Users Group"". 
In this fanzine, he encourages anime directors.  
Much original anime of the 90s started from ""Char's counterattack"". 
Life-size character which tells a lie, has a sexual desire and cannot arrange own idea, and meta-fiction gave influence strong for the important anime of much 90s. 
For example, ""Evangelion"", ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"", ""Escaflowne"", ""Clamp's work"", ""Oshii Mamoru's work"", These are the representatives. 
I can see those animes like the reply to Tomino's anime.

    Char's Counterattack should not exist. 
This movie was a slap in the face to those who enjoyed Zeta Gundam and Char Aznable. I'm shocked to see many users here giving this movie such a high score when it really doesn't deserve it. Spoilers ahead, You've been warned.  
Let's start off with the plot, with no reason given nor hints during the entirety of Zeta Gundam and it's sequel ZZ (which Char never appeared in), we see that Char Aznable, the man who gave that great speech to ward off the titans from Earth, is now the leader of Neo-Zeon. Char's goal is to wipe all life on Earth by dropping an asteroid on it. Yes, the same Char who refused to join with Haman Karn in Zeta who also had a similar ambition (dropping colonies in ZZ) is now trying to kill all of Earth's inhabitants. Why and how did this happen? We saw that Char got over the death of Lalah in Zeta, yet here he is in this film complaining to Amuro that Lalah could've been his mother. It's almost like that ""MARTHA"" meme from Batman v Superman. Does this movie at least take the time to explain why he's doing this? Barely. His motive for doing all this is to get back at Amuro for killing Lalah, when he actually teamed up with him during Zeta without even a hint of a grudge against him. Again this all doesn't make any sense. 
Do you see a pattern in this review? It's like Yoshiyuki Tomino and his writers wanted to undo Zeta Gundam's story when it's actually one of the best stories from the U.C. 
Another gripe I had with this film was the characters, there was barely enough time to get to see characters like Amuro and Char. Instead screen time is given to characters like Quess and Hathaway, and let me just say, if you thought Reccoa was a bitch, wait till you see Quess. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, you'll come to wish Bright came out early to slap the shit outta her. I was actually cheering for Chen when she killed Quess but that turned into disappointment with Hathaway acting even worse than Kamille or Amuro's tantrums by killing Chen. I almost felt bad for her but then I realized it was Chen's fault that one of the key crew members from the Argama, Astonaige dies due to her recklessness. A pointless death that wasn't given any mourning or impact. Just a quick boom, he's dead. Just like how Tomino cared for Zeta when he wrote this movie.  
I wanted to see some of the characters like Astonaige and Bright react to Char's sudden change of character, but instead we're given a sappy side love triangle/square between Quess, Gyunei, Hathaway and Char. What for? At least 3 of these characters end up dead anyway. Another thing that I would've love to see are characters like Sayla and Kamille show up. Remember that crappy ending with the Newtype Psychic wave that covered the Earth? I would've loved to see Kamille and Sayla sense and feel that wave. What did we get instead? An old grandma and some animals reacting to this wave. Not even a cameo from those two. I guess Kamille and Sayla missed out on this shitfest. I think the movie would've been slightly better if we had them show up in some way to remind viewers that those characters still exist. I would've loved to see Kamille and Sayla just try and ask why Char is doing all this exactly like I was when I saw this movie. 
The ending was a WTF moment too, did Amuro and Char die? Did they just disappear out of thin air? The last thing we hear from Amuro is a ""aughh"". We didn't even see the cockpit explode or the asteroid explode either. It just moves away from the Earth. I guess I'll have to watch Unicorn to find out. I'm getting a lot of mixed messages on this ending.  
I read some background information on this film and found that Tomino actually based this film on a novel he did. So basically this movie was all just a cash grab to get his novel to sell but most of the stuff he writes turn outs to be the exact opposite of what actually happens in the anime so I guess this time we didn't get so lucky. (He originally wanted Amuro dead in the original series and in Zeta, he wanted Kamille to commit suicide after killing Scirocco.) I think we should be glad that someone is forcing him to change these endings around but I guess since he was allowed the reigns to do as he pleases in this film, we got such a sad and pathetic sequel. 
Trust me, I wanted to like this film, this was hyped up among the Gundam fandom for being the thrilling conclusion between Amuro and Char's rivalry, but instead I left disappointed. This was as much as a negative whiplash to me as Tenchi Muyo's OVA 3 was. Both this film and Tenchi OVA 4 required reading outside source material that never left outside of Japan, leaving viewers like me just confused on this whole film. This film probably would've been a lot better if it was another TV series instead of a movie, that way we might understand these new characters better. For now, this movie really blows. 4/10

    Before saying anything, I’d like to mention a few changes that are gonna happen to this marathon, one good and one bad. The good one is that thankfuly the Gundam X Review will not end up being delayed. The bad news are that I’m pushing 08Th MS Team all the way back to August due to me wanting to use it for a completely different marathon. If you wanna know why August and why 08Th MS Team, check the cast list. Anyhow, onto the actual review: 
As any Gundam fan should know, Char and Amuro were originally gonna appear in ZZ, however Tomino eventually decided to instead let Judau and the gang have their own little adventure and leave Char’s whole subplot for another story. While working on ZZ, Tomino was also writing a Novel called Hi-Streamer. After the movie was greenlight, however, he rewrote the novel into a new one called Beltorchika’s Children (Relax, Hi-Streamer still exists and you can buy it in most bookstores… so long as you live in Japan) with the intention of using the rewritten version to be adapted into the movie. However Sunrise for some ungodly reason decided to adapt Hi-Streamer instead. Unfortunately Hi-Streamer was so ungodly long that Tomino had no choice than to completely axe out the entire first half of the Novel. 
To many Gundam fans, this movie is considered one of the highlights of the franchise. Most fans will tell you that this is the best Gundam movie and a fitting end to the storyline started with 0079. Indeed, the fanbase loves this movie. Unfortunately, I am not the collective unconscious of the fanbase. So here I am, with my flame shield up as I prepare to defend myself from the rest of the fanbase to explain why this movie was a massive disappointment. 
Story: 
I’m not gonna harp too much on the fact that this movie starts In Media Res as that’s frankly something I don’t mind nor do I disagree with. It’s a good idea and does give off the feeling of being thrust into the middle of an ongoing conflict. I’ll also admit than whenever Amuro and Char’s rivalry is focused on, the film finally gets going. The two’s interactions are generally well written, as even though they hate each other, there is an odd feeling of respect around them. 
Unfortunately not only does the movie not focus on that enough, but almost all plot threads from previous series are never mentioned. You’d think Tomino would bring some of them back, but bar a few minor nods, almost nothing is done with that. In the end, even though the film is meant to have a feeling of finality, it doesn’t due to how disconnected it feels from the rest of the universe. You could literally skip Zeta and ZZ and miss almost nothing bar a few minor nods to the events of those series, and emphasis on minor. 
Also, as stated before, what’s supposed to be the main focus of the movie, Char and Amuro’s rivalry, isn’t touched upon enough. Instead, you have a series of plot points that, while connected, don’t have much thematic weight behind them. Part of the reason why is the characters, which I’ll touch upon later. I will say this though: The ending was cool. It was a fitting end, and I’m glad Sunrise hasn’t resurrected Amuro or any crap like that. 
Characters: 
This is where the fun part begins. Now, as the end of Amuro and Char’s story, you’d think they’d bring back old characters to give this all a sense of finality, right? Well, you’d be wrong! The only returning characters are Bright, Astonaige (Who is unceremoniously killed off), Cameron (Mirai’s wimpy fiancé from MSG) and Hathaway (And only as a technicality as he barely had any personality before this movie). Aside from them, no one came back. Why did they do this!? Where’s Kamille? Where’s Fraw Bow? Where’s Mirai (Bare her super minor cameo)? Where’s Sayla? WHERE’S EVERYONE!?  
At the very least they could’ve brought Kamille and Sayla back, as they are one of the few characters to have personal connections to both Char and Amuro (In fact I’m pretty sure Sayla was in one of the early scripts, however Inoue You was yet again unavailable and since Tomino didn’t want any recasts, she was written out of the plot entirely. Beltorchika’s Children instead gives her role to the titular Beltorchika, which, while not as effective in my opinion, I can see why her given that she and Amuro did kinda have a thing going on back in Zeta Gundam), but nope! I’m not even asking them to pilot a Mobile Suit or anything, I’m just asking them to see them react to what the hell is going on. 
As for the characters that did come back, Amuro has shown some growth since Zeta Gundam, having gotten over most of his trauma due to Lalah’s death, and Bright is as great as always. It’s Char whom I have issues with. I don’t mind that he was turned into a bad guy again as it is a natural progression from his character in Zeta Gundam. My problem is that not only do we not see his sudden change in personality, but we aren’t even told why he has changed. I’ve seen multiple explanations in the internet and they all make sense, but we’re never told that in the movie proper. 
As for the new guys, I don’t like them. The role either Sayla or Beltorchika was meant to have (Being Amuro’s love interest) was given to Chan, and she’s basically Sayla except half as interesting. Hathaway and Quess are annoying, which is a problem as a good bunch of the movie is focused on them, so this naturally lessened my enjoyment of the movie. Oh and Astonaige has a girlfriend now, but she was so bland that I can’t remember anything about her. This is not a good cast to say the least. 
Animation: 
Thankfully, as you’ll see, I have next to no complaints about this movie in the technical side of things. The movie looks amazing, easily the best looking Gundam material at the time. Its fluid, has no stock footage whatsoever, and overall just looks fantastic. The fight scenes in particular are great, with a lot of strategy being involved in both sides. There’s also some minor CGI used for the Space Colonies, but it’s thankfully not too noticeable. 
The Mecha: 
There are three in particular worth talking about. The first is the RE-GZ, which is basically a mass production version of the Zeta Gundam and looks great. Then there’s the Sazabi, Char’s new MS, which definitely is a microcosm of his whole character. Finally is the Nu Gundam, which is amazing, and definitely Amuro’s definitive MS (And also the bane of Banpresto’s budget as they keep spending all of it on this one MS). Also, since I’ll never get to mention them again, the Hi-Nu Gundam and the Nightingale from Beltorchika’s Children are both fantastic and I love them. 
Sound: 
The soundtrack is great. Multiple tracks are sure to stick to your head, and all of them fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Also, massive props to the movie’s main theme, “Beyond The Time”, one of the best songs in the whole franchise. 
Voice Acting: 
We’ve got one hell of a cast here folks. As you would expect, Furuya Tooru, Ikeda Shuichi and the Great Late Suzuoki Hirotaka return and do a stellar job as always, with this easily being their best performance as these characters. But they’re not alone, as a bunch of then newbies join the fun. I mean, we have Sasaki Nozomu, Adachi Shinobu, Kawamura Maria, Ikure Kazue and the one and only Yamadera Koichi. So yeah, this is one hell of a cast. 
Overall: 
Yeah, this movie was not one I enjoyed. It had so much potential, but it squandered all of it into pieces. I know this movie is a fan favorite, but it just wasn’t for me. That said, the beautiful animation alone does at least make it somewhat worthwile, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t at least somewhat enjoy myself here. So overall, not a bad movie, but far from a good one at the same time. 
Final Score: 5/10

    [Edit] This marks the end of the original UC plot. Thus, I recommend you to see MS Gundam and Zeta (do not see  ZZ, for more, see my review) before you see Char's Counterattack (CCA). I`ve given a lot of thought before I wrote this review because I had mixed feelings with this OVA, despite liking it. See my thoughts below and take your own conclusions. 
Story: After the monumental disgrace that is ZZ Gundam, you are treated with a fine Gundam story with CCA. The shows come back full force in this OVA, with political intrigue, character development, a little dark tone to the background and the definitive end of the original UC arc. Overall I think that the story is satisfactory. By now you are familiar with the main protagonists such as Char, Amuro, and Bright - hence finally seem them in action in their decisive battle. Although the idea of the plot is interesting, with Char finally taking control of Neo Zeon and making his final attack on Earth by trying to cause a new Ice Age and making all humans go to space (don't worry that's not a spoiler, you know this by the first 10 min), I felt that something was off. By what exactly? Everything seems to fit in the background and Char's motivations are fine, same for Amuro. After thinking I discovered what was off. Part of the core of this OVA, and by core I mean ""major plot instigator"" is the story of Quess. And Quess side story is lame. Quess is the rotten apple in this OVA. She introduces a sort of stupid romantic subplot, together with weird motivations that are completely out of the essential element of CCA. This is the final fight between Amuro and Char, and you have this annoying girl coming from nowhere, with ridiculous motives and pathetic script and she kinda drags the story down. I have no problems with romantic subplots when done right, and I`ve mentione some I like in my review of Gundam Unicorn, but this one is just terrible and out-of-place. Finally, I think that the ending could be like...A LOT better. It is cool, but nowhere near what it should be. You will surely enjoy, but there are some bumps here and there. 
Art & Sound: Art is amazing, better than Zeta, but the OST lacks in variety and it has no ""memorable"" music for the final fight or major events. For something important to the UC as CCA, they should have worked on the OST. 
Character: Char, as always, steal the scene. Amuro, this time, steals as well. He shows a brilliant maturity for his character. That made me so happy because you follow Amuro since the beginning, and in here you see him as basically a grown man, focused and dedicated to his cause. The interaction between Amuro and Char are perfect. You can see these two characters have a long history together and want to close this conflict once and for all. However, in parallel with this brilliant and awesome writing, you have to deal with Quess. An immature, uninteresting, lame, obnoxious, irritating and spoiled girl. Why? Why was she needed? I could totally see the story without her. Amuro and Char didn't need a new spark to fight, they have enough baggage to fight each other. Quess is a drag to see and a drag to the story. Aside from her, all secondary characters are good too. Forget Quess and everything else is on point. 
Mechas: As a lover of mechas and Gunplas, I am always trying to get more of the mechas. This time you have the Nu Gundam, that kind looks similar to Gundam RX-78 MK II from Zeta - which was kind of a letdown, but his gunpla showed me otherwise. Man, the mechanical aspects of Nu Gundam are awesome. Char gets the Sazabi, with a cool design that is similar to the Zakus, but more elegant. Jagd Doga, piloted by Gyunei is extremely lame. Looks like a bird Gundam. I was disappointed with the MS in CCA because I had higher expectations for the MS which would fight in the final clash but there is nothing wrong with them. 
Overall: A great closure to the original UC arc. Seen the interaction between Amuro and Char is worthy enough to see CCA because is perfect. The story is compelling, but they could had worked on a more epic fight and a better ending. Quess is a terrible addition but ignore her and you should be fine. Don't miss seeing this OVA because is very good.

    After viewing Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta Gundam I figured I finish off Char and Amuro&rsquo;s story in UC.  I&rsquo;ll admit I was quite disappointed by MSG and Zeta however, Char&rsquo;s Counterattack did not disappoint me as the previous UC Gundam titles.   
Char's Counterattack throws us right in the middle of a major conflict between the newly reformed Zeon and the earth federation.  Char, who was missing since the events of Zeta Gundam has resurfaced and is the head/founder of Neo Zeon.   
First the bad.... 
What was the point of introducing the 13 year old Quess?  She serves no real purpose and only detracts from what the viewers really want, Char and Amuro.  Even worst is that she is an annoying and immature brat.  Due to such immaturity she is unable to comprehend her actions in the battlefield and believes its all a game.  Amuro said it best when he sensed an enemy that was more playful than hostile.  Hathaway was similar in respect to Quess but didn't have as much screen time.  You would think after the events in Gundam 0079 and Zeta Gundam that pilots that aren't mature enough shouldn't be send out into the battle. 
Where the background!?  Char's Counterattack threw is right in the middle of a major conflict without telling us how they got there from the previous Gundam titles.  Thus, Char's Counterattack requires you to have seen the pervious Universal Century Gundam titles to understand the characters.  While it does spend time developing the story, it spend way too much time on the new characters and not enough as to how Char and Amuro got to where they are now.  Apparently in Gundam ZZ Char or Amuro didn't even show up. 
Now the good.... 
With Char's Counterattack, Gundam finally focuses on one of the most interesting and longest rivalry in UC, Char Aznable and Amuro Ray.  Their final battle is easily the most intense and memorable battle in UC.  Not only that but the other battles were also well done.  I&rsquo;m not really into giant robots however, I made an exception for the Nu Gundam that Amuro pilots.  The way he pilots the Nu Gundam is simply awe inspiring.    In general, they were some of the most well choreographed action scenes I've seen in a long time.  These battles are also heighten by the strong personal involvement of the combatants.  Unlike the pervious titles, I feel that Char's Counterattack finally gets balance of battles and characters right.   
The BGM is also quite nice and very fitting.  This is how &quot;space opera&quot; music should sound like.  In addition, it isn&rsquo;t too in your face as in Zeta nor very 80&rsquo;s as in MSG. 
Of course how can I forget about Amuro and Char?  Char's Counterattack has an unfair advantage since they feature establish and well known characters.  To get full enjoyment one must watch MSG and Zeta to fully understand these character and get full enjoyment out of this movie.      
Char's Counterattack, focuses on one of the most interesting and longest rivalry in UC, Char Aznable and Amuro Ray.  The mecha battles are well choreographed and intense, thanks to a combination of characters, music and animation.  Too bad Char's Counterattack looses too much focus due to unnecessary secondary characters.  Not only that, some of the secondary characters are simply annoying and unlikable.  Also, they don't spend enough time showing the back story.  There is simply too much of a gap between previous Gundam titles and this one.  To those that have seen MSG and Zeta this is a must watch.  There are some flaws, like lack of focus but, it is made up by the final climactic battle between Char and Amuro.

    TL;DR: A well animated very bad written movie that doesn't deserve to exist. 
Now, let's see where we are, shall we? 
We've seen Gundam 0079, an interesting show that suffered due to budget constraints and a comittee that did not understand what kind of show Tomino and his team wanted to make. However, things changed for good. After the succesful run of the compilation movies everyone and their mom went crazy for Gundam, so Tomino pretty much had a way bigger budget and a green light to do with the next show as he pleased. 
So, he made Zeta Gundam, an amazing anime with impactful stories and characters, truly one of the best shows in all of Gundam history. He used both the original and new characters to develop meaningful emotions and grow his cast with a not common complexity in anime. 
...Then everything went downhill. ZZ Gundam happened, and god knows we don't talk about ZZ Gundam.  
So, let's recap, the original show introduced us to the Amuro/Char rivalry. These characters went from enemies to comrades to even some sort of friends in Zeta Gundam.  The last thing we knew about Char was how he blew up fighting alongside the AEUG crew against Haman Karn and Neo Zeon, trying to save the earth against plans of mass destruction. So, it totally makes sense that when we meet Char again in this movie suddenly he thinks genocide isn't so bad, he somehow became the leader of Neo Zeon  and is 100% ready to drop massive things onto earth like a previous baddie he fought did. *cough Haman Karn cough* 
If you think this doesn't make sense, well that's the entire movie, my friend. 
The story is total nonsense, there's no character development for any of the old characters or even the new characters, It's not consistent for previously established events or straight up doesn't care. The pacing is horrible. This is the movie for you: There's a space battle at the beginning, then characters talk for a bit. Then there's a new space battle, then characters talk for a bit. And then there's another new space battle and suddenly the movie ends. 
That's not the worst part, pacing issues would only be trouble to a certain extent, making the movie mediocre at worst. But no, there are many things more. They only needed to show us the final showdown between Amuro and Char, and what led to it. But instead we got this 30%-40% screentime dedicated to Quess Paraya and the other idiots in this ""love"" triangle. Hathaway and that other imbecile whose name I already forgot. They serve no purpose to the plot, they serve no purpose to the thematic elements, they serve no purpose to anyone's character development. They just waste precious runtime in a movie that's already way too long and needed more time to flesh out other way more interesting aspects, like Mirai's struggle trying to survive in earth, which just as it is doesn't add anything to the movie and is totally wasted. 
Then there's the ending. Oh god what an awful ending. At first i thought it was going to be a nice ending that the movie did not deserve, as I'm someone that enjoys melodramatic events that may not make sense or seem chessy but help drive an emotional message to the viewer, and I thought Amuro dying pushing away Axis with the help of other units was a good end to the character and a fitting message of hope and sacrifice that the film was not worthy of. But then he just sparkles the shit out of everyone and the meteor, we have a brief montage of people on the earth reacting and suddenly the movie ends. There's no actual end to the conflict. Neo Zeon still exists, they just ruined the plan they had in mind. There's no aftermath or closure to talk about. It just stops dead. 
This movie does not deserve to exist. It serves no purpose other than being the first Gundam film. Nothing leads to the events of this film. We gain nothing. We've met so many characters thru the first 2 shows. But seems like nobody in the production team cared about them. Char's sister Sayla? She's nowhere to be found. Kamille? No. Apparently all the relationship they developed together during Zeta was not worthy of even being mentioned. So much for being his mentor and father figure I guess. But Quess throwing tantrums about having a crush both on Amuro and Char really deserved the screentime I guess. 
I'm starting to think Tomino is just a bad writer/director who just got lucky when making Zeta. 
But hey, at least the mechs are cool.

    Have you ever hated someone with your very existence yet at the same time, respected them as an equal? The Gundam Franchise is a lot of things: a treatise on war, an epic about human inability to truly connect to someone else, and, most importantly, is Kamille a man’s name? But at its core, Gundam is about a rivalry between two men, Char Aznable of the Principality of Zeon and Amuro Ray, of the Earth Federation. A battle of ideals, of clashing wills and a battle for love. This epic rivalry has spanned the decades and has become a defining part of anime culture as a whole. Char’s Counterattack is a film where the decade-long grudge between Char and Amuro reach a conclusion. Now is this finale worthy of ending the decade-long rivalry between two of the most iconic characters in anime history?  
  Char’s Counterattack takes place several years after the Gryps conflict in both Zeta and Double Zeta Gundam. Char Aznable uses his immense political influence garnered in Zeta to take control of the Neo-Zeon movement but make it more in line with his father, Zeon Rem Daikun, ideological vision. In order to counter this insurgency, the Earth Federation creates a task force called Londo Bell with pilot Amuro Ray and former commander of the White Base, Bright Noa, at the helm. The iconic rivalry is sparked once again as Amuro and Char fight for the fate of the Earth. 
  Unfortunately, the grandiosity of the premise is lost in this two-hour long movie. There are so many problems with the writing, more specifically the pacing. We are introduced to characters at a breakneck speed, not being able to truly learn about their personality and their motivations. Moments that are supposed to be emotionally impactful are merely glossed over as the film callously transitions to the next scene. The editing of this movie is very poor, to say the least. Every scene transitions at something of a frantic pace where it becomes very easy to lose track of events occurring.  
  A large portion of the movie is dedicated to exposition. I would estimate around 40 to 50 percent of the film is just characters recounting events. As opposed to showing us what happened to Char during his five-year retreat, we are told what happens to him. Anime is a visual medium first and foremost. As opposed to a character telling us what happened, we should be able to see what happens in the form of flashbacks or some imagery associated with the dialogue. The lack of visuals during these sometimes emotional exposition scenes creates an emotional disconnect with the events that preceded the film. This, in turn, makes any changes that the characters go through due to those events lacking gravitas.  
  The only thing that saves this film from being a total disappoint, has to be the last 20-30 minutes of the film. In typical Tomino fashion, the finale is packed with emotional resonance, drama, tension, and despair. The fight scenes are well choreographed, the music suiting each scene. The finale is arguably the clearest and concise part of the movie. It felt as though it is the only part of the movie that Tomino really got to convey all the themes of Gundam in a grandiose yet poignant conclusion. It is a shame that this level of talent was displayed in the other portions of the film. In the end, this felt like a movie of compromises as opposed to someone’s unfiltered artistic vision. 
  The animation is beautiful and still holds up remarkably well even today. There were no reused scenes like in most Gundam series and it maintains a very crisp look. I appreciate the character designs even more when compared to how goofy some anime characters look today. The battle scenes were phenomenal and truly captured the chaos of the battlefield.  
  I would argue that the worst part of this film has to be the inclusion of new characters. None of them are remotely interesting and represent the worst of the archetypes scene in Gundam. Quess being the most flagrant offender in all of this. Her character seems so erratic that everything she does isn’t based on any logic and is rather done on a whim. She has no strong convictions and when the film tries to proclaim she does, it comes off as shallow. She has no moral framework for any of her actions and behaves with reckless abandon for everything and everyone around her. There isn’t enough time for the film to establish her character so she becomes a bland and more revolting outline of Reccoa from Zeta Gundam. A character who, without an in-depth look into her personality  would have been the ultimate dramatic contrivance. Quess succumbs to that fate.  Gyunei is basically Kamille with all the interesting contradictions and personality removed. He adds nothing to the film and is just a stand in for Kamille. 
  Some people take issue with how Char has been characterized in this film. Frankly, I think his character is the glue that holds this film together. Nothing Char does is out of character when you look at his past behavior in other series. Char has always been selfish and manipulative. What he does in this film is nothing different from the norm. There are moments in this film where we are able to look closer into Char’s mind than ever before. We get to learn his true feelings on Amuro, Lalah, the war and his responsibility to maintain his father’s legacy and how it weighs down on him. All the series combine and result in the complex layering of Char’s character that is present in this film. It is a shame we do not get enough time with the product of all this development and characterization. I can understand why people have an issue with Char’s seemingly radical change in character. It is because we do not see what led up to him rekindling this conflict.  This disconnect is what makes people think that Char’s character was defiled in some way. The tragedy of this is, if there was a build up to him establishing Neo-Zeon there would not have been an issue.  
  This film is a major disappointment. This is not a worthy send-off to the most iconic rivalry in anime. The only thing saving this film from utter disaster is the finale and even that cannot erase the entirety of this film. If you are a fan of the Gundam Series, more specifically the Universal Century line, you will be immensely disappointed. However, I would still recommend this film so there can be some semblance of closure.

    Another of the UC Gundam seires is in review. When I was first introduced to Gundam I saw this movie right after the Oringinal Gundam series. Of course this is another sequal to the Char verses Amuro saga, and the last. The great fighting duo make their last stand in this movie and it's all that it should be. 
UC 0093, and the AEUG has defeated the Neo Zeon's leader Haman Karn. A new person comes and takes place of the Zeon movement, and it's none other than Char Aznable, the real son of the Zeon Zum Deikun. Also Amuro returns to the broken Federation forces, and is transfered to the Londo Bell team. Now they both fight for honor and a place in this world. 
Char wants to complete his fathers dream by bring both spacenoids and the people of the earth together. But Char has a theory that all the souls of Man are weighed down by gravity and the only way to unite them with spacenoids is for them to feel the power of space. What Char means by that is by droping an asteriod on earth and creating a nuclear winter. Amuro will do anything to stop Char now, and this is his last chance to settle the score. 
Like many of Tomino's work, it does not ceases to amaze me. If you are a fan of either Char or Amuro this is the movie to see. The end to the great Zeta War.

    The movie is mediocre. 
On the side of the plot, there is no previous set up for the events, leaving the background like a big black hole gap behind. Plus, the antagonist's motivations are so stupid that is a pitiful to see: 'we must save thi planet of the human vermins and pollution so let's dump a massive amount of spacial trash and nukes to make then leave'. True is that even in aeug times the objetive was pull out humans... right into space, but it was a ecologist organization too, protecting earth by destroying it is well... bullshit. 
The characterization is a real piece of fiasco. No more than a collection of 'already seen characters' 'The kid that was brought with the sole purpose of staging something REALLY stupid' 'the cyborg new type idiot ludicrous woman' and so on, there is no a single bit of intelligence nor endearing or originality in the original cast. 
Not satisfied with a mediocre original cast, plus, the Char's characterization is preposterous, representing an involution in all respects. Not only in his motivations but personality too, demised to not much more than an upstart brat playing around with heavy weaponry. Leaving us with a pale reflex of old good times, when a mature epic veteran in 80's fashioned sunglasses still was there. At least Amuro was really fine and matched quite well.  
In the trash box we can pick up some edible rice grains in the form of some nasty good pieces of battle stage music/sounds. Not really impressive though (well, may be by the time). Included with a really joyfull pace rhythm and the enjoy of something gundam like are the only reasons for save the score of total fall off the cliff.

    *Spoilers for Char’s Counterattack* 
A harrowing tale of love, betrayal, grudges, death, and faith, an epic battle to save the world, and a final battle to settle one of fiction’s greatest rivalries and conclude an epic saga that has spanned an entire decade. This is final chapter! This is Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack! 
Much like Char’s plans themselves, this movie didn't quite pan out as intended. Instead of the gripping and somber finale to an iconic rivalry, the film is more of an exhibition of how stupid people can be and how a lack of foresight can damage a saga, film, and finale. The epic conclusion to this legendary and awkwardly managed saga somehow doesn't utilize the saga's canon very well, resulting in a misfire as tragic as its characters' fates. Let's find out how, shall we? 
0093 Universal Century Calendar. A plan has been initiated to drop Axis onto Earth by none other than Char himself. Why Char is doing this is beyond me thanks to the fact that not only was he never remotely like this, but there was no progression from any Gundam series to this point. Either way, this has gotten the Earth Federation panicking, especially since whenever they try treaties, he backstabs the hell out of them and blows whatever forces are near him to kingdom come. None take it worse than Amuro Ray, the ultimate rival of Char, and thus, the rivalry begins again. Sounds like an interesting premise, don't it? If you made it so that Char’s plan is in line with his typical actions and how he is as a person (since they aren't), this would be totally kickass. That said, you'd also have to give a good justification for why he went back to being an awful person considering how he was in Zeta Gundam. On top of that, you'd need to justify why these two would butt heads again, and the film's attempts at this aren't very compelling. Already, this film fundamentally fails. 
Speaking of reasons this film fundamentally fails, we get the introduction of 3 characters: Gyunei, Hathaway, and Quess. I'll talk about how fucking retarded these pieces of shit are later, but let’s just say that their stupidity and actions are very...intrusive, to put it kindly. Two of them are the subject of bad heel turns and all of them have terrible romantic aspiration subplots that start up for no legitimate reason, and the amount of time spent on them simply bogs down the movie. They're not the only ones with romance subplots however since not only has Astionage gotten himself a girlfriend named Kayra, and Amuro and Chan have banter before sharing a kiss in the middle of the movie. Both go nowhere but I have to ask: did something happen between Amuro and Beltorika? They aren't in ZZ, and we never see that they split in either this or Zeta Gundam, so what happened between them that Amuro is now single and ready to kiss a girl? This movie doesn't say anything, making this subplot rather badly written in terms of implications. For Astionage and Kayra, he wants to cook her a pasta but in battle she dies, causing her to mourn over her corpse about the pasta he earned to make for her. Honestly, it would've been more impactful if we see him making pasta before the news got to him. Regardless, let's move on. 
Even with all that, there aren't many plot holes or many other inconsistencies in the film, but then we get the Axis drop and Amuro’s attempt to stop it...along with a team of mobile suits from the Federation’s 88th fleet outta nowhere just to try and make a deus ex machina, which initially seems to fail but then, out of nowhere, Amuro’s Nu Gundam starts shooting our green particles after a morality sparring match with Char and this is enough to get Axis off course and deflect it entirely, with the fate of our two rivals left unknown, and then the movie abruptly ends after this deus ex machina. I don't need to explain how bad this writing is, right? I mean, it doesn't kill the movie, hell, the plot wasn't all that great to begin with thanks to bad character subplots and decisions but this was just the final nail in the coffin. At least, it would be, but the final nail actually turned out to be how this film doesn't have any stable chronology with the previous installments, as nothing built up to this. To be fair, given how not much left over from Zeta properly carried over to ZZ, it's no surprise the same happened here. What is surprising is that where ZZ resorted to retcons, this one is disconnected from ZZ almost entirely. The only thing connecting them together is a throwaway line about the failures of the main antagonist from ZZ who made her debut in the final stretch of Zeta Gundam. As if this film needed more reasons why it just doesn't work on a basic level. 
For the returning case, luckily Noa and Amuro are basically kept intact, even despite how agitated they are in this crazy new crisis. Char meanwhile...let’s say that his biggest flaw is the extremes of this new plan since this is basically the product of progression that we never got to see since he was never remotely thinking of this kind of action in Zeta or the original Gundam, so what happened that made him truly hate humanity so much? Aside from that and how decidedly uncharismatic he is now given his main antagonist status, he’s kept intact as well. We never cared about Astionage, and Mirai is barely even present throughout this movie.  
Now to what really tanked here: the new characters. Let's start with one of the most hated characters in Gundam history, Quess! Aside from being an emotionally manipulative bitch, she, for no reason, tries to stake claim for both Amuro and Char and hated people close to them for “getting in her way” and really shows what a spoiled brat she is. The fact that she becomes to willing to kill anyone and everyone makes it worse since she’s already a flip-flop character, an inconsistent pancake that just flips and flops all the time because she’s a selfish and manipulative whore that has nothing else concrete about her! Gyunei initially to want to study her as a way of improving himself as a Cyber Newtype but then, out of nowhere, he falls head over heels for her and is ready to do whatever it takes to destroy Char to win her over. Why he would fall for a 13-year-old when he is seemingly a lot older is beyond me by it just happens abruptly without any reason as to why. The jackass doesn't even get to die properly because we never actually see him die outside of his mech getting blown up. You'd think for such a notable character for the film they'd at least show him in the process of dying.  
I'm aware that Hathaway isn't actually exclusive to CCA, but like Katz, we only get to see him do things and have a personality that affects a narrative in his somewhat grown-up appearance, which is here in this case. For the most part, he seems like a decent kid, even though he falls for Quess. However, late into the movie, he loves her so much (for no real reason other than they went on a date, we don't even see him having a crush on her beforehand) that after Chan kills her to save his life, he outright blasts her to death. Is the main message of the movie supposed to be that love makes you stupid? If so, there are better ways and settings to show that message without having such badly written as intrusive characters on display, and all of these guys have ample screen time and relevance to major scenes in the movie, just to make matters worse. Anyone else in this film is one-dimensional and basically worthless to the narrative other than Nanai (who is only really notable to me for delivering a deliciously satisfying slap to that bitch Quess) that I'm not gonna waste any more time dissecting this overall pretty terrible cast of characters. 
Studio Sunrise and Studio Hirabi to make this film, and if nothing else, the film looks gorgeous. The action and mech animation shows off the best of what the 80’s were capable of, with such crisp and smooth animation and detail with every bit of action and movement, making the battles brilliant to look at. The Nu Gundam and the Sazabi have particularly great mobile suit designs and all of the other new mechs look pretty neat too. The almost angel dust-like sparks coming from every shot fired from a blaster rifle and every explosion make this film just majestic to bask in when it comes to seeing the fight scenes, and the character animations and designs look great as ever. The only gripe I have is in one of the colonies having egregiously dated CGI that also fucks over its frame rate. I never knew that was possible in the 80’s and it was a disconcerting experience to be sure, though it hardly takes anything away from the glorious visuals of the film. Honestly, the visuals are so good that some viewers might just be able to brush the writing aside and enjoy it as an action spectacle. That's all this film is good for, honestly. 
Sadly, almost none of the tracks in this film are memorable, which is a real disappointment, especially considering how good Zeta's soundtrack was. There is only one track from one of the earlier scenes that sounds pretty good and I wish there were more pieces here that sounded actually cinematic and memorable. None of it is bad music but nothing sticks, not even the ED. It's not the worst soundtrack in this timeline, but not one of the better ones. The dub is also rather meh, barring Brad Swaile’s great returning performance as Amuro and Michael Kopsa as Char Aznable, who despite a few weak moments, sounds pretty good and has a really booming political speech at the midway point. Everyone else is rather so-so, some being worse than others but even then, the dub never sounds overall bad, but these two basically saved the dub from absolute mediocrity. 
Like with some of the worst anime Gundam installments out there, good mech action isn't enough to make a good Gundam series. If an action show or movie wants to have a story as its focus, the story it tries to tell actually has to make sense and the drama has to work without being an intrusion on the product and our enjoyment of it. Unfortunately, Char's Counterattack fails at all of this, so you either enjoy it as a spectacle, or you get a headache out of frustration. Despite trying to cap off one of the most monumental sagas and rivalries in the industry, the film can't justify its own existence. The more Studio Sunrise uses this film's events as a lynchpin for dodgy future titles, the more headache-inducing these failures become. There's a reason I say this timeline dies with the end of Zeta Gundam.

    Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack, by the well-known Gundam creator and director Tomino Yoshiyuki, is the first movie to enter the Gundam franchise. Watching this definitely requires the viewer to have at least seen Mobile Suit Gundam and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, because otherwise you will simply not get the full enjoyment out of it. With that being said, the film has some great aspects and memorable moments, but there are a couple disappointing flaws that weigh down its score. 
The biggest flaw lies in the story. And not in the plot, but in the back story. The plot is a fairly basic tale in the UC Gundam universe that pits long-time rivals Amuro Ray and Char Aznable against one another again, but the background is a little foggy. Char is now the leader of the new Zeon army, and Amuro is back in action alongside Bright Noa, just like old times. This is all great and it sets up a nice story, but we get absolutely no explanation as to how these things came to be. Between Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ, the predecessor to this film, and CCA, there is no telling of how Char, who went missing after Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, climbed the latter to become the Zeon big dog. Likewise, there is no telling of how Amuro, who was also last seen in Zeta, became a star fighter of the Federation again. 
But aside from the poor lack of background, the story that we witness in the movie is fairly good and nicely played out. It has a decent mix of saddening situations and epic moments, as expected of Tomino and the Gundam franchise. 
Now the art and animation, when taken into account dates back to 1988, is something truly stunning. The mecha designs look so much more detailed and the battles have wonderfully animated choreography, resulting in some pretty impressive action. Adding to the action's intensity is the well apt music, which has the classic space opera vice to it, once again suiting the atmosphere very well. 
The quality of character is a little debatable. Mainly because there were some new supporting characters that made appearances that were a little unnecessary. The attraction and large amount of screen time to these small co-stars took away some of the focus on the fierce rivalry of Amuro and Char. And really, these two adversaries are who we want to see the most out of here. These two men are prominent stars of the Gundam metaseries, and we want to see them in all their glory. They deserve all the screen time is the point I'm basically trying to get at, and unfortunately these small fry that are introduced in this film steal the spotlight just a bit too much. 
In the end though, this is still a thoroughly enjoyable watch for any Gundam fan. The rivalry between Amuro Ray and Char Aznable is truly unforgettable and one of the best in all of anime, and watching this undoubtedly caters to those who want to see more of it, even if they get a tad sidetracked along the way as I've explained above. Overall, this is a pretty solid movie and it deserves its place in the Gundam franchise.

    Well, I personally felt that this movie was conclusive, but felt more like a conclusion or some extension to the original series, and not really that well connected to Zeta and Double Zeta. Then again, this was the intention but I felt this movie could have used some of the main characters from that series or give us an update on Camille, Fa, and Judau, though there are other materials out there exclusive to Japan on what happened to them. Since the movie really has no direct connection to Zeta or Double Zeta, I don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s really required that you watch those series, but I recommended you watch the Mobile Suit Gundam trilogy to understand the foundation of the rivalry between Char and Amuro. Resuming characters that play a significant part are of course Captain Bright, his son Hathaway, Bright&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s former fianc&eacute; Cameron also plays a part as well. New additions for this movie are Nanai Miguel, Char&rsquo;s right hand woman and Quess Paraya, the daughter of a Federation politician who has teenage issues and has erratic newtype abilities. The movie is reasonably paced and the characters all have their use. Granted the new characters do stand out, I just don&rsquo;t think they were worth sacrificing some other characters over.  
In addition to this movie going back to its roots with the Char and Amuro rivalry, the style and design of the mobile suits, specifically the Nu Gundam, Nu being N-U gives that impression as well. The current Gundam&rsquo;s style goes back to its roots with the more blocky design rather than the aerodynamic frames that were present in Zeta and isn&rsquo;t really as heavy packed as the Double Zeta. A notable difference is that it breaks the tradition of the red, white, and blue color scheme to a black and white one. With the Nu Gundam comes a new kind of material that is meant to go with the newtype abilities called the Psycho Frame and the addition of funnels also gives Amuro the chance to use those abilities at their fullest potential as well.  
The suit Char has this time is the Sazabi, also reverting back to his iconic red scheme. The Sazabi is more cylinder like and kind of goes back to the bulkier and bloated design of the Zakus. The battles are more intense than ever with the heavy fire power and the potential of nuclear weapons being deployed by the Neo Zeon. There is more of a risk factor to the fights that make it more realistic and reasonably paced, but yet exciting. The character designs for the most part are still in tradition and faithful to the original, but presented in a new quality of resolution that really compliment the updated costume designs. Char&rsquo;s design is quite unique. He&rsquo;s more muscular looking and he&rsquo;s more dignified, but yet still recognizable.  
Well, the roles of Amuro, Char, and Bright are still respectively reprised by their respective seiyuus throughout the lifespan of the franchise and still pull off their roles as if they never aged a day. Anything I had to say about their roles in previous installments can be said here as well. For the dub, this came out before Zeta got licensed in America so some of the roles are reprised by the dub actors from the TV series as well such as Brad Swaile is still Amuro. I personally thought the dub was excellent in its own right.  
The music is constantly intense. Not really as militaristic as Gundam soundtracks, but enough to pull you into the battlefield of space. The ending theme Beyond the Time also truly reflects the nature of the ending of the movie.  
 I wouldn&rsquo;t call the movie fan service, but is truly meant for fans of Gundam because it&rsquo;s really what I may call the symbolic ending to the original Gundam series. I wasn&rsquo;t really that disappointed with Char&rsquo;s character, but I think they could have built things up much better. But I guess I have to find other material that is either in manga or game form to get what I&rsquo;m looking for. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I do feel delighted this movie does pay homage to the original Gundam in its own right, but I felt they could have done some other things with it to make it more complete and balanced with the other series, but I guess they really wanted to make this movie distinctive with the newer cast.

    I watched this anime when I was still in Elementary. It was one of the best shoujo anime that time and almost every girl in my school loved it. 
Story: 8/10 
The plot is good and unique (especially during that time). It was something that most of us are dreaming about - Going on a different world, meet cool friends and go on a journey with them. The start of this anime was good but at the middle of the series it became annoying because of Miaka.  
Art:  9/10 
For an anime of that time, the art is good. 
The characters are good looking. Although sometimes they look weird. 
Sound: 10/10 
The opening and ending song are one of the best. 
The sound effects and background music are also great. 
Characters: 8/10 
Miaka: can be very very annoying and useless. She wanted to help but she mostly do nothing but just get in the way and it's annoying how she think of nothing but Tamahome. 
Tamahome: Although he is amazing at the beginning of the series, he also became annoying but it was also because of Miaka. 
There are lots of interesting characters but the story focused on Miaka and Tamahome. So they were forgotten and didn't get the attention that they deserve. 
Overall: 8/10 
Despite it being annoying, it's still very entertaining.

    If you like bishounen, romance, love triangles and humour then Fushigi Yuugi has it all.  
It has plenty of characters all different and with their own goals but all share one common goal.  
Once I began watching this anime, it easily had me hooked. 
Both dubbs are good in my opinion :). 
Miaka can at times be a bit dense but her character makes up with the silly but amusing humour. 
I would recommend if you like romantic endings. :)

    Fushigi Yuugi was one of the cartoon shows I watched in AXN when I was a kid. It was fun to watch but now I'm older, I have a different perspective. The art and animation was ok. The fighting scenes are ok as well but the problem lies within the main character of the show. 
Miaka Yuki: 
She is greedy, stupid, coward, crybaby. Everytime when she wants to rescue Yui, she always thinks of Tamahome. She keeps saying ""Tamahome! Tamahome!"" many times until I got tired of it. Just like characters keep saying the name of a person who he or she loves like Yuka Minase from 11eyes, Orihime Inoue from Bleach. She also becomes vulnerable in situations and becomes the damsel in distress. She always do not want to accept the difficulties in life and she easily cries all the time. 
I really just don't understand why the characters like Miaka. 
So because of her, she screwed the whole show for me and I am not going to watch it again. As a note, I really hate whiny and crybaby anime characters like her. If you enjoy the series, that's cool. But I just couldn't dwell in it.

    I am truly saddened that this amazing anime is like ranked 722?! This anime has so much that is missing from a lot of current anime that deal with similar themes. It really has great character development and stories, that I feel many anime in the same category lack. The plot may seem typical reverse harem romance stuff, but it's quite deep dealing with various issues such as bisexuality,betrayal, sacrifice, tragedy, etc. also, this anime is hilarious! this is the full package for all u adventure and romance anime lovers. For it's time and even now, Fushigi Yugi is a classic, definitely way better than some of the anime that's out now.

    This anime lead me to tears, happiness, and butterflies in my stomach (Tamahome & Hotohori!). This anime has about everything; Action, Romance (I'm a sucker for romance), drama, comedy, martial arts, fantasy and more. I watched 22 episodes in a day! The characters are very loved. (One weird thing is I'm trying to become a writer and I wondered how it would be like to be in a book so I thought I'm gonna write a book about that happening. Then I saw this anime! It wasn't exactly like my idea but it was close enough). This is one anime that you don't want to set aside for another day! Watch it now! You will be happy you did!

    This anime is my all time favorite. It is definetly worth watching because I thought that it really sets a standard for other shojo animes (not saying that it is like sailormoon-- that's much more childish). This anime had times that made me laugh like crazy and some parts where I really cried, but I watched entirely the WHOLE series, OVAS and all. Fushigi Yuugi is absolutely worth watching.

    Even after reading the summary, I didn't know what to expect of this series, so I was taken on a surprising ride back to the mid-1990's era for anime with this under-hyped and overshadowed work of art.  
What I wasn't expecting, though, was how I saw several parallels with ""The NeverEnding Story""- I won't go into too much detail in order to avoid minor spoilers, but as a start, both titles involve a mystical book that connects someone from the real world with a fantasy world in another dimension, and if the viewer wishes to see it this way, it could be a huge metaphor for human fantasy in general. The plot of ""Fushigi Yuugi"" is like if the author of ""The NeverEnding Story"" decided to write a story with the reverse harem romance shoujo formula we still see today. However, the result was way more surprising and complicated than that. In my opinion, what makes ""Fushigi Yuugi"" good is how despite the more conservative time period it was conceived in, it took bold risks with the shoujo-typical themes it had, turning them darker than what you might see in other shoujo anime of the same time period (such as Sailor Moon), and I mean into almost adult themes, so this anime is not for the weak of heart. Fortunately though, it has plenty of fluff scenes and comedy to balance that darkness out with.  
Overall, if you like reverse harem romance and can handle dark themes, the canon ""Fushigi Yuugi"" story is definitely worth the watch.

    Fushigi Yuugi is one of those shows that you either love or hate. Being an older show, it has it's own cliches, but aside from that this anime has been completely addicting for me. However, it's definitely not meant for people who can't stand characters dying, complete betrayals, continuous plot twists, and ""never ending love"", all with a side of slap-stick humor. If you're picky about those things, then all I can say is watch it and judge it for yourself. I'm normally really picky, but I loved it to the last episode.

    If you are looking for a lighthearted romance, this is not for you.  Seriously, find something else.  The cornucopia of drama, tragedy, angst, and violence leaves you unsatisfied with the ending.  I couldn't watch the OVAs after the 52 episode series, despite being someone who hates leaving things unfinished, because I just couldn't take any more. 
However, for the time period, the artwork is very good.  It references a lot of its contemporaries, such as Sailor Moon, Inuyasha, and Dragon Ball.  But unlike Kagome in Inuyasha, Miaka is pretty useless.  She's worse than early Usagi (Sailor Moon) even.  As a main character, it's hard to root for her. 
Honestly, I'm so frustrated with this anime that I need a hug.  Don't venture forth unless you're prepared to fall down a slippery slope into depression.  It's not Gakuen Alice's manga depressing (is anything, really?), but it'll make you want to table flip here and there. 
That's my review (cautionary tale).  If you love this anime, my apologies.  I'm happy for you, really.  But while I don't hate this anime and think it's decent, I don't ever want to watch it again. 
The end.

          Looking back now this anime is very cliche in the shoujo anime world, however when it first came out it was different and it was a new concept. 
       The story follows a girl named Miaka who picks up a book that sucks her into a Ancient China literally. Her friend Yui (yuck) is sucked in as well. The two of them meet Tamahome and a love triangle is born. Later on it becomes a love pentagon, but that is besides the point.  
      Also Miaka learns that she is the priest of Suzaku and must gather all seven of the Suzaku warriors in order to save the world she was sucked in. This anime is probably the founder of all typical shoujo anime. 
       The art was a different feel as well. If you compare this show to other 90 hits like Escaflowne and Yu Yu Hakusho the art is more personalized Japanese. The guys in this anime are way hotter and crazy color hair is born! This anime is probably also helped shaped the art and look of anime today. 
        The sound was not bad for a 90's anime. It was clear and interesting. Soundtrack wise the songs almost always fit the mood. My personal favorite is Hotohori character song Dengon. It has a elegant and gallant feel to it like a warrior. You can check it out here>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMIUeH7Hyd4 
         I enjoyed this anime series to the point I find myself re watching it. 7/10 
WARNING THIS REVIEW IS ONLY ONE PERSON OPINION. FOR BETTER OR WORST CHECK OUT THIS ANIME!

    I decided that this year I will go back and watch the good old anime, the classics. From then I will move to the new ones which will hopefully be completed.  
What is there to say about this show? Oh yeah, this show it's hard to pinpoint a favorite character and a least favorite. Most are decent. But I guess my favorite will be Nuriko, yes, gotta love the abnormally strong, beautiful cross dresser ;) second goes to Amiboshi, he seems like a nice dude. Yui did awful things to her best friends Miaka, the protagonist, but if you were in her shoes and had that brain washing influence you can't really blame her, she just seems, a bit extreme. Nakago, source of the Suzaku Seven, Miaka, and Yui's misfortune, somehow I can't hate him either. If the story was told in his view, he would be one of those misguided heroes/villains like Light or Lelouch. If I have to pick a least favorite, umm... I'd say... King of Seiyu? An insignificant character but all the main and sub-main are quite likable.   
Something that annoys me is how often the Miaka falls! That girl is always tripping at crucial moments! Learn to run properly , lol! She is too much like the stereotype magical girl character, head over heels with a bishounen dude, gluttony, stupid, a crier, etc. A lot like Usagi from Sailor Moon but Miaka has more will and whines a lot less. 
I would give this anime a 7/10 good, has its tear jerking moments packed with action, has its drama but it seems a bit cliche, maybe because it's old? 
Its biggest flaw is that Universe of Four Gods was written in ancient Chinese and while Yui and everyone else can read it but Miaka, maybe because they are smart and Miaka is kinda stupid, but it was written in ancient Chinese so why when Miaka got transported inside, she speaks Japanese and everyone can understand her, even having Japanese names and names of the cities are more Japanese than Chinese, same with the gods. At one point, Miaka wrote something on the window in kanji but Amiboshi knew what she wrote. This other time, Tamahome wrote her a letter and she read it, she can read the letter but not the book? Besides the language flaws, there arent really many other flaws.

    Riding on my recent wave of nostalgia, I decided to re-watch this anime classic. I first dove into this series in the late 90s, while I was still in high school. It was my introduction to mainstream anime, outside of the offerings on network television. I remember being enthralled by the story, characters, and animation. Compared to what I had been exposed to previously, FY was an experience. After re-watching however, I don't feel it was able to stand the test of time in most areas. I actually took down my overall numerical score by one point after this re-watch. 
One area this anime still holds up in is the characters. Now some of this feeling might be based in my nostalgic past, yet I still feel the anime holds true in character development, at least when it comes to the secondary and semi secondary characters. Even back then, the anime did a fantastic job in giving each character no matter their standing in the story an individual background and personality. Everybody's motivations and thoughts were distinct unto themselves. 
I fell in love with my previous favorites all over again. Nuriko, Hotohori, Nakago, Amiboshi, and Tasuki still hold as fantastic, well-rounded characters that have installed their ways into my heart again. Even ones that I could have done without years ago like Soi and Suboshi I could grow to appreciate given a more mature outlook while re-watching this series. 
Yet, I also see the glaring flaw in an aspect of this area, watching from the point of view of a middle-aged woman versus a teenager. That area is Tamahome, Miaka, and their cluster *beep* of a relationship. I seem to remember even back then being irritated by their whole relationship drama. Now, decades later, it's to the point of being unbearable. There is absolutely nothing admirable in Miaka's character. I have no idea why so many characters fall in love with her or want to have sex with her. Point blank, she's an idiot and in no way admirable. Their whole shouting matches at each other is irritating, so much so, that I fast forwarded through every exchange. If they were having a lovey-dovey seen, I skipped it. 
Story wise, I think you have to keep in mind the timeframe this manga and anime came out. The whole Japanese teenager traveling to a different world stick wasn't as commonly done. Unless there are relatively unknown 70s and 80s manga or anime out there I'm not aware of with this storyline, I think FY might have been among the first to introduce it. So keeping that in mind, I feel the story in this series is pretty strong. There's a lot of growth, conflict, and emotional turbulence to go through. I felt the series kept audiences engaged with plenty of obstacles to overcome and maturing characters. This aspect, I feel, has held up against the test of time. 
Again you have to remember this anime is on the older side when it comes to the art. For the time, some of the artistic techniques were revolutionary. When you compare FY to other contemporary titles like Sailor Moon, you'll notice that fight scenes and general animation flow stand out. Colors are bright and fight scenes draw you in, especially when tied in with the high emotional content of this particular title. Yet, when compared with anime from today, one can say the art doesn't stand the test of time. It's obviously dated; though emotionally driven, fight scenes can appear clunky and sometimes facial structure gets boxy. If I was someone new to anime and this was my first title, I might not notice the now substandard art. However someone who's been around the anime block now and then will definitely notice. 
Sound I felt was fairly good, especially the opening theme. There's just something about that opening number that gets you excited for the upcoming episode. It's just so iconic and doesn't sound like anything else I've ever heard. Maybe that's a bit of the nostalgia talking; yet, I can't help but be revved up by that opening number. Whoever put this musical score together also knows how to use music for emotional moments. For an anime that has as many tragic moments and emotional turbulence as this one, that's a key point to success. Other sound effects like for fighting and other exchanges are fairly common, like most other anime. Nothing too awesome stands here. 
Even after 20 years, this title still holds a special place in my heart, despite it's now more glaring flaws. Even with the dated artwork and the whole freaking Miaka/Tamahome thing, I still felt myself enjoying FY again. Thankfully some of those aspects that are irritating now I can fast forward through. I was still moved by the other characters, their trials and fates. I think an even score of seven is about right. FY will always hold a place as an anime classic, despite its many issues. It's a part of my personal anime history so stands out for me. Whether anyone else will find enjoyment out of it, I think they'll need to just keep in mind that this series is an older one. I think with that thought percolating in the back of anyone's mind, this title could still be enjoyable to anyone.

    This anime it's amazing! The world they create it's so well constructed, that I can star believe that one day it can happen to me when I can go to my library. 
The love between the main characters it's so well expressed, that I don't even know if it's possible to love somebody like that. 
The people who like love stories they MUST see this anime!! 
Even if it's a old production, it's a classic that the anime lovers have to watch and enjoy. 
I already re-watched 3 times but I can continued watching again, again and over again, without getting sick of this characters, this love, this world, the battles, so on!

    This is the kind of show that you can come back to anytime to watch again and never be disappointed! The plot is outstanding with amazing characters that you become attached to throughout the show.  
The PG-13 rating is very accurate as the show contains non-graphic nudity at times, but other than that it is extremely enjoyable. You can really tell that a show is good when one of the characters die halfway through and you just think  ""I don't think I want to watch this anymore"" or ""This show will never be the same without him/her"". 
The art is unique to the time period that this anime was written in, so if you're new to anime then I wouldn't let that put you off, it's well worth the watch! There is amazing character development  and hilarity throughout; It is both the most hilarious yet enjoyable show that I have ever watched, with times of seriousness, laughable encounters etc.

    I can't believe I went through all the effort to re-watch this anime after 8 years and I still dig the opening, ending and the story of the anime. 
If you really liked anime that talks about romance and hardships then you shouldn't miss this one. It may be little long by today's standards but it's well worth it. 
it's an anime filled with all kinds of feelings and surprises. It's very emotional especially when it gets to the sad part so be warned.

    This was the first anime I ever watched with more than 14 episodes. It is really good, and enjoyable. I remember being at school and just thinking about what could happen next and then I would watch it for hours. Even though the story is very good some parts did annoy me a little bit. For example; the main character Miaka Yūki either gets kidnapped or attacked every single episode. Which leads to Tamahome (Main Guy) to shout ""Miaka!"" about a million times through out the episodes. But hey ho i still loved it!  
It has everything really; Action, Romance and it is very very funny at times :)

    Fushigi Yugi's considered the most famous of Yu Watase's works. Considering I got a good amount of enjoyment out of her later work Ayashi no Ceres, I decided to give Fushigi Yugi a shot. However, the series proved to be rather underwhelming with me considering the number of cliches common in a shoujo anime that this series gives off. 
This series is loaded with plenty of melodrama revolving around the romantic developments with Miaka and Tamahome, the tensions between Miaka and best friend Yui and the ongoing conflict between the Seiryu Seven and Suzaku Seven as they try obtaining the means they need to summon their country's respective beast spirit. Attempting to exaggerate the issues faced by the characters also come along with their state of mind not making much sense at many points. Characters are shown rather frequently to make foolish decisions to put themselves at risk despite knowing the dangers they get caught up in, this predicament regularly happening to Miaka and needing Tamahome to save her from any sort of danger. This problem also arises with characters who become aware of obvious facts with the questionable moral issues of the side they take up and not questioning whether they made the right choices, this regularly shown with Yui's hostility towards Miaka for her assumed suffering despite knowing of facts concerning the nature of the book she is whisked into and the questionable morality of many of Nakago's actions. The show's efforts at also having you feel for the personal losses of major characters (shown prominently throughout the show's second half) also suffers to an extent due either to sloppy writing in the logic of events or limited depth on said prominent characters. If you're not a fan of melodrama, this series will regularly push your buttons throughout its run. 
Outside of the melodrama, Fushigi Yugi also carries a number of the cliches common in a shoujo anime with Miaka pretty much put in a reverse harem scenario with the multiple bishounen that make up the Seiryu Seven, several of whom develop romantic interest in her and fall under different character types. The show makes attempts to toss in comedy to relieve the title's more serious moments, but these attempts mostly fall flat. The series also tends to get in a bad habit at many points of having the old ""conveniently saved in the nick of time"" cliche come up whenever a character is in a life-threatening situation. Also, it appeared the series had quite the limited budget for its visuals considering the choppy frame rate for animation, washed out backgrounds and occasions of off-model character designs. 
Despite my constant complaining though, the series does do some things right. The characters that are reasonably developed enough get enough background where you do care for what happens to them and are rather likeable, despite the show's melodramatics making their serious moments look silly at a number of points. Also, the world of the book that is a regular setting in the series is based on actual mythology and elements of astronomy followed by the Chinese such as the Four Symbols and 28 Mansions, that make for interesting study and comparison to those interested in learning more about Eastern cultures. 
Overall though, I feel rather indifferent towards Fushigi Yugi compared to Watase's later work on Ceres. The series dips into too much cliches and melodrama common in shoujo anime for me to get seriously invested into the title's plot and characters, as well as having moments of sloppy narration and writing as a result of said melodrama. Unless you're a big shoujo fan, I think Fushigi Yugi may be getting more praise than deserved from older fans.

    Althought the majority of cast are males this is still one of my favourite anime out there. 
It has a really good story plot which is similar to Inuyasha in some way where girls trapped in some place they don't know about and was saved the main hero. There are no ecchi stuff in this anime at all and it is fan-service free. 
although this is a very old anime its still worth a watch if you are a romance-die hard fan, this anime seriously provide all that romance stuff and it will make you cry more easily if you are a girl. Although it can be a pain to handle the amount of whines/complains of the main character. but still its a really great anime that alot of people should watch if they are looking for a good romance anime. 
this is a master piece.

    Back in 1996 as an in coming freshman in college I was an anime fan but all I watched in high school were mecha shows: Macross, Robotech, Gundam, Macross Plus etc.... I discovered the Anime club during the 1st half of my freshman year and my Anime life changed forever.  
What was playing there was an array of very different things: Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Marmalade Boy (which I loved), Maison Ikkoku and this gem of an anime. You see I was never into the non-mech ones but sitting down as part of the Thursday night club viewings I discovered Anime was more that just giant robots shows. 
Sure the story now would be considered cliche Alice in Wonderland story but this has a special place in my anime viewing heart. The characters are all fantastic, funny and you really care about them. There is Drama, action, comedy and even a dark tinge to it at times. This anime also had the greatest cliff-hangers of anything I've ever seen.  
You knew it was about to go to credits when the music would start in the background and then leave you there hanging. The collective AWWWW COME ON as it would it end would happen every week. You can probably chain watch all 52 now pretty easily but then on SUPER-VHS TAPES and getting only 1-2 episodes at a time it gave you this sense of anticipation of more episodes to come.  Set in a fantasy ancient china backdrop, this one has something for everyone. I will always rate this a 10/10

    【 The following is a review of : Fushigi Yuugi, Fushigi Yuugi (manga), Fushigi Yuugi (OVA), Fushigi Yuugi: Dai Ni Bu (OVA),  and Fushigi Yuugi: Eikoden (OVA) 】 
Fushigi Yuugi is like if The Neverending Story was a melodramatic soap opera. It literally has the same precurser to The Neverending Story: two girls go to an antiquated library and then get rabbit holed into a magical storybook, but in this variation, it isn’t a high fantasy world, but a mystical version of ancient China. This series would have been much stronger if Yu Watase could write a story without leaning on the same old, tired reverse harem tropes. 
• As far as the characters are concerned, there are a multitudinous amount in this series. There are seven Celestial Warriors to protecting the priestesses of fate from the opposing factionsーthe warring territories of the Gods: Suzaku & Seiryuu; exactly like the rivalry between the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth in X/1999 (CLAMP). Unfortunately, I found the main two love interests DREADFULLY annoying.  
• The main girl, Miaka, is an air-head who’s only talent is eating and having a pure heart―and since this is a shoujo manga, the “mary-sue” trope makes the female lead the most desirable to all of the male characters, even if she does nothing to earn the power of priestess and her main superpower isn’t kicking ass, but rather, whimpering about her boyfriend and turning down other men who make advances towards her. Admittedly, she does develop a little bit as the story goes on and becomes a little less whiny when the war causes families to be slaughtered and leavess villages in ruin, but through 95% of the series, all she does is whine about Tamahome (the first person who saved her when she was transported into a celestial Chinese world).  
• Tamahome, on the other hand, is more likable, I guess? He at least has a motivation for his actions: he’s greedy because he’s feeding his impoverished family. That’s great, but he’s a really terrible boyfriend to Miaka, breaking up with her and repeating the same old, tired Twilight tropes of “we can’t be together” and then dramatically leaving Miaka to swoon in her overly-dramatized heartbreak. They had as much conflict as a couple as Inuyasha and Kagome; one of them is being seduced by another person, OH NO, but it turns out that it’s just a huge misunderstanding or the character is brainwashed and they get back together.  
• I’m not a huge proponent of stories having a good “message,” because I personally feel that a story should be able to stand on its own without shoving some kind of “life lesson” propaganda down your throat, but when there’s an elderly lady narrating the beginning of every episode, talking as if this is a story that has merit because of the character’s strong and tenacious spirits, then I expect a female lead would dump a male protagonist who gets brainwashed and cheats on her, while beating the crap out of her and breaking her arm, AND she still whines about it instead of getting pissed, even though she doesn’t even KNOW that Tamahome is brainwashed. It’s like the lonely James Cameron, Titanic fantasy of, “I’ll always wait for you,” because that’s apparently what docile shoujo heroines are supposed to do―sigh and stare out the window until their long-lost love returns.  
• Two particularly likable characters in this series is a trans-woman named Nuriko and one of Miaka’s love interests, Tasuki; Tasuki was refreshing as suitor because he actually focused on his duties as the protector of the priestess and wasn’t pinning her down on a bed and confessing his love to her every other episode, not until the OVA at least. Nuriko is a badass who has super strength, but still manages to stay feminine and refined. She also is still an incredible best friend and protector of Miaka; despite the man that she’s in love with, Hotohori, having the hots for her friend. After watching and reading, Fushigi Yuugi, I wanted Nuriko to be my friend! 
• There’s an interesting dynamic with the war between Suzaku and Seiryuu; during the last half of the series, it is revealed that two identical twin brothers were chosen to be on opposite sides of the war, it was something that was supposedly decided by fate and I thought that plot twist made a better statement towards to cruelty of pre-ordained destinies than the other chipper warriors. The series focuses on this with another twist that’s revealed, but I won’t ruin it the people who want to be surprised about it later. The most irritating thing about this series is that the “plot,” for the most part seems to accommodate romantic tensions and drama rather than focusing on the actual horrors of war. It’s more like the two factions are houses in the Hogwarts dormitory, rather than soldiers forced to risk their lives in battle, for the vague motive of having the priestesses’ wish granted by the Gods. 
• Overall, Fushigi Yuugi is an iconic series of its generation, but it has so much contrived drama that it’s hard to take seriously. I have nostalgia of plugging my earbuds in and listening to the MIDI version of “I Wish” on the way to school, but I believe that this series is a relic that only the young could enjoy with all of the juvenile stereotypes laid into its framework; unless you’re an older person with the tastes of a prepubescent who’s constantly tormented about their unrequited love and sniffling into a tissue somberly while writing a fujoshi fanfiction about twincest. I honestly think that Yu Watase’s best work was Ayashi no Ceres, Fushigi Yugi never made me get emotional, but Ceres did. Volume 8 of the manga made me sob like a baby when I was fifteen. I liked her other “dark” series, Alice 19th, as well, but I felt like it was short-lived and could have been more than what it was, since it was invoking a Kaori Yuki style of dark dreamscapes.  Fushigi Yuugi is admittedly better than ONE other series in Yu Watase’s mangaography: Absolute Boyfriend, which is a reverse harem version of Chobits and pure terribad trash. Overall, Fushigi Yuugi is like an animated fanfiction, I give the TV series a 4/10, the two OVA(s) a 3/10 because of feeling that they were unnecessary after the series’ conclusion, Fushigi Yuugi: Eikoden a 1/10 because it’s filler trash, and I give the manga for Fushigi Yuugi a 5/10 because Yu Watase has pretty art and the Miaka’s whininess doesn’t have a voice.

         This is the most tragic love story imagined by the human mind.  I first watched this show when I was young, and decided to rewatch it again recently, since I never officially finished it. 
     Yes, I gave every single category for this show a 10/10.  I love this show, and I believe that any person who is a fan of romance anime should definitely take the time to watch this series.  You can also learn a lot about actual love from this series; the way you should treat your significant other, the way you shouldn't, etc..   
     Honestly, I can't think of a proper way to review this show, other than saying I strongly recommend it to anyone.  The art is very detailed, each character has something special about them in their own way, the plot for the show is outstanding.  I wasn't born at the time that this show was made, so I don't know if it was ever a mainstream anime for the time, but I believe every anime fan should at least give this show a try.

    I like Fushigi Yuugi but I don't really love the series... If I want to compare, I love Akatsuki no Yona much much more... Why? Because the heroin is not reckless as Miaka in Fushigi Yuugi... 
Miaka always do something without thinking of the consequences... At most of the time, when that happens, she involves other members of the Suzaku seven to save her... they had to fight because of her recklessness... I know Suzaku seven exists to protect the Suzaku priestess... but if she is more aware of her position as the priestess, she might be able to avoid bad situations... On the other hand, I love Hotohori and Nuriko... They are cool... 
The art resembles Saiunkoku Monogatari's...The plot is okay... Not boring since there are many ups and downs... It is fun too...Though, sometimes I felt tired watching so many tragedies... By the way, I like the ending... If you like historical fantasy anime such as Akatsuki no Yona, Brave 10, and Harukanaru, you probably like Fushigi Yuugi too...

    This anime is amazing! It keeps you always entertained. You always want to watch it. I have watched this anime for FIVE DAYS straight. The characters in the anime are so great! I don't even know how to describe them. All the characters have so much will power to protect one another. The story line in the anime is very entertaining as well. Since the anime was from the 1900s, the art style may not be so good. However, the storyline is amazing! So much love and so much friendship. The sound quality of this anime is not bad for an anime from the 1900s.

    Honestly, this is the anime that started it all for me. Although I believe the first anime I've seen has to be Pokemon. This was the first title I've actually seen through to the end (and 3 OVAs after). I really should have rated it higher, but as of now, that I'm reviewing it from memory, it would have probably been a disservice or filled with Nostalgia Points.  
Story-wise, it really was unlike anything else my young impressionable self has seen. But it also probably geared me away from harems in general. Whenever I look back on it now, I just realize how messed up it kind of is. But that's not for this review to disclose. It's a wild ride, definitely, so you better get settled in. The characters are unforgettable. Years and years after watching this, the characters are going to be what sticks with you. Their quirks, their personas, really. More than just the lead couple themselves. If you're new to anime or if you're a young viewer, they should serve as your primers to the different archetypes you'll be dealing with in other anime shows. Other characters from different shows might not be as vibrant or as exaggerated though.  
Of course, the sound, too. It was distinct enough that whenever I hear of the OP and ED, or even anything that sounds remotely like it, I just start thinking back to those days where I watch and rewatch and obsess over this show. They're really great.  
I am unsure whether I will enjoy this series as much as I did back then when I was still new to the whole anime scene. But for the nostalgia factor alone, I rated it with 8 points for enjoyment. It definitely has the comedy down pat.  
Maybe I should give it a rewatch and revisit/revise this review when I have the time?

    Fushigi yuugi is not a piece to be underestimated.  
It's a pretty clear reverse harem anime, so it is expected to be loaded with drama. The beginning is very light, but still captivating, which definitely counts as a factor to keep watching. In the end, it's well worth. It has several messages, some of them a little hidden, and some of them more obvious. The fact that it isn't very long, but not too short, is very good. Mainly, this is a very solid anime piece and I do recommend it to fans of romance, adventure and drama. it's based on four old Chinese beast gods and their correspondent constellations, so fans of fiction and mystical anime would enjoy it too.  
The characters have a very good design - I admit, I do have a preference on nineties anime designs - not only in physical means, but also in psychological. I think there's truly a match between the characters looks and their own personalities, that were very well traced! 
In the end, it's a very solid anime and a very, very good one. 
It's really to sigh and cry for, and i highly recommend it, regardless.

    Initially, I thought this anime would be one huge chick flick focusing solely on romance and relationships. I am glad I stuck with it and continued to watch, because boy was I wrong! It has a very good balance of romance, drama, comedy, and action. I enjoyed it very much the entire way through. Most of the characters are very compelling, and you find yourself growing attached to them--especially Nuriko and Chichiri (Ya know?). The only reason I didn't give it a pure 10/10 rating is because a few times, the plot seemed to take some ridiculous turns--some good, and some not-so-good. I won't spoil them. Everything ended up working out anyway, and it wasn't cliché. The ending was one of the most beautiful endings I've ever experienced in an anime. The ending is the entire reason I decided to write a review. (Usually I just rate anime I watch, not spend the time writing up a review.) But this anime is definitely deserving of this review.

    I started watching this because I loved Inuyasha and many people said that Fushigi Yuugi is similar.  
Story(7): It's not the most original plot, though at its time it must have been pretty good. Even so, I love this type of plot. The story doesn't lose the original plot as it goes on, which is a good thing.  
Art(8): It's good. Though I don't understand why most girls have short hair and most boys long hair.  
Sound(6): I don't remember any special soundtrack. The opening and ending themes weren't too great either. 
Character(5): This si probably where the anime fails the most. The main character, Miaka, is an idiot. Seriously. I mean, yeah, the funny and klutz type of main character is more popular in animes, but they should at least develop as the anime goes on. Miaka doesn't. She always makes decision on her own and doesn't think about others' feelings, thinking she protects them. She may seem too kind for her own good but, honestly, she never learns! She runs away and when she's about to be injured or killed, she yells or thinks ""TAMAHOMEEE!"" thinking he would always come to her rescue. Sometimes he does but when he doesn't, others do. She will only be useful at the end where she (FINALLY) does something good. 
Also, every fucking character falls in love with her. God.. 
About the love story between she and Tamahome.. I don't find it too real. She falls for him in a blink of a second and, surprisingly, he falls for her too. But again, she's stupid and always makes stupid decision which will affect Tamahome too. I'm angry with her even more because she can only think about Tamahome in some situations where she shouldn't.  
The other characters are fine, but I think they didn't get the importance they should have been given.  
Enjoyment(7): At first I watched the the first five episodes and stopped. After a month, I started watching it again. There are some predictable and some unpredictable moments, it was fine. I tried hard to watch the last ten episodes, I felt like the anime wouldn't end. 
Overall(7): It was a good anime, but if the main characters wouldn't have been so useless it would have been much better. The manga Fushigi Tuugi: Genbu Kaiden had a stronger lead so it was a lot better.  
If you want to know if it's worth watching it.. I think it is. There are some funny scenes that will make you laugh. Give it a try. 
Feedback is always welcome! :D

    I began really liking this anime, and was ready to give it a big ol' ten, alas... 
I feel I may give away SOME of the story line so read at your own risk. 
(Yes it's true, I don't doubt for a second Inuyasha is based off this, so I thought this could be the stronger of the two and I think initially it really seemed that way.)  
Story:  
Later in the series I realised something so forgive me for getting a bit spoilery but, the girls are under the constant threat of rape, that really started to grate.  
Another pattern which was a common theme is that the couple kept getting separated for no good reason, which was true of another anime released around that time and as a fan of romance it drove me crazy. I feel if less time was focused on them running away from each other focus could've gone on what I think would've made this series stronger. Parts of the story did use the rinse/repeat method so we see our heroes make the same mistakes and it gets pretty frustrating to watch. 
Also a point I found lacked lustre is one of the main sevens power seemed like a good plot device to aid the gang. Only so little of them was seen that it came increasingly apparent this was not an option.  
I really thought as we were little by little introduced to the rest of the seven they'd become a merry gang, using their special powers as if they were a tag-team, for me I'd have found this more enjoyable, but it was not to be.  
Again closer to the ending of the series the heroes are faced with great peril and unless I missed something, despite the threat having the upper hand just seemed to go 'meh' and leave them be. Some other little things around that time aren't explained very well. 
Art: 
Pretty good, no complaints. 
Sound:  
Great theme song. VAs were good. One in particular must of been the inspiration for aforementioned anime. 
Character: 
Eh... 
So they're the band of seven...only about two of them are given next to zero screen time after their introductions and another increasingly less. I thought this would be remedied later in the series after some circumstances, but not so. One in particular just ends up being sort of there. 
I also found it odd that initially Miaka seemed pretty spunky and seemed a physical match against the average joes who attacked her. Only, increasingly she became the damsel in distress, so for me she lost her appeal. Though she did show her strength in other ways.  
The main villains motives were only explained in the last few episodes so in one way it really turned things on their head, in another, for the most part they seemed really one dimensional. 
The characters we did see more of were really loveable and a joy to watch. You're made to really care about those characters and that's what made this series so compelling, in spite of everything. 
Enjoyment/Overall: By all means it wasn't all bad and I'm glad I stuck it out as I did consider dropping it. Though I realise I haven't sold it well... I enjoyed the ending enough that I may grudgingly watch the OVA's.

    Fushigi Yuugi gets some passes because of it's age and because of the nature of the shoujo genre in the 90's.  
This being said, the main character is still utterly stupid and unacceptable. The characters are a real shortcoming in this anime. Miaka is not a heroine. She is a cipher for the viewer to place themselves in. Even when she finally attains the ability to defend herself she ends up being AWFUL at it. Her main jobs in the anime is to serve as a global taunt for the enemies, eat food, and be the cipher/object of the reverse harem's affections. This is literally all she does for 50 episodes. It blows me away how characters like Bella Swan are so rejected and torn apart by most fandoms but characters like Miaka are acceptable.  
The characters I found most interesting weren't even the ""good guys"". Yui had the potential for MASSIVE development in the series due to her experiences but she was never really given any chances. She's vastly ignored for a part of it and ends up getting defined by one bad thing that happened to her. At that point, she isn't really a person, as much as she is ""That girl that had the bad thing happen and now she's bad too.""  
Also, if you're a victim of sexual assault, I suggest staying away from this anime. I dropped the series a couple times throughout because of how poorly and insultingly that subject is dealt with. Unless you like it being implied that you're damaged goods.  
If you're looking for a lighthearted ""girl out of place"" type anime, I suggest trying something like Inuyasha and staying far away from this. It has not aged well.  
Story: Has real potential but gets totally botched by bad characters.  
Art: Fine. I with there had been more animated combat.  
Sound: Fine. Nothing stand out as good or bad.  
Characters: ...Awful.  
Enjoyment: While I did complete the anime, I would hesitate to say I ""enjoyed"" it. More so I was hoping the heroine would redeem herself for 50 episodes of shame. She never did.  
Overall: Mediocre

    First Anime I ever watched and I have to say that it was a simply amazing first experience with anime. Although many would say that the style is either outdated of the sound to muted, but both make the series a completely different experience from any other anime I have ever seen. 
Rating: A++ 
I would recommend this anime to ANYONE, both guys and girls!

    Just finished this yesterday. I was completly hooked on this show since episode 1.  
I am not usually into older anime. i am very picky when it comes to art and romance. I try to avoid drama.  
This is the oldest anime i have ever sat down to watch, and one of the best one's i have ever seen. 
 I LOVE how it isnt a repetitive story. alot of shows have something crazy happen by the next show, they act as though nothing has changed. This show stuck to one story, one goal, and never repeated the same fights.. always something different.  
The romance was nice and i felt satisfied with it. it was pretty funny in some parts as well. :)

    Story-  
Okay this is the reverse harem genre and the whole idea of the girl being lost in a magical world has been over-used by now, but this is what somewhat started it all (yes this is BEFORE Inuyasha). I'm proud to say that even though I've seen other animes that have taken off from this idea, this still is able to maintain this freshness throughout. The story for the most-part is pretty predictable. Even though is tries to through some ""OMG"" moments of twists and turns, the show does not execute it well enough to make it as truly powerful as it could've been. The story is laced with comedy and alot of drama and from my understanding is pretty enjoyable for most the viewers. The story is good but definately not perfect.  
Art-  
The art and animation for this show is a double edged sword. Since this was released it has been a good 14 to 15 years. So I wouldn't expect it to be up to par animation-wise. Fights include speed lines and flashes (bleehhhh seizure) during those ""Pwnage"" moments. Typical of something released long ago. The art is able to maintain this amazing classic feel while also being incredibly intricate. It can go from this to SD/ Chibi in those comedy moments. The art is translated well from it's manga counterpart. The only problem I have with the art is that the men(some of them) often have the same facial features as the next ie; Tamahome to Nakago. The quality can from good to barely average. (honestly the art does not tend to bother me because of how engaging the story is.)  
Sound- 
The sound is good as well. Not normally my come of tea and i felt it could've had a little more effort put into it. It includes alot of synthe and somewhat cheap attempts to fill the void of the moment. The romantic songs often left me with the impression of being with a ""magical unicorn"" (what would you expect from shoujo though lol) It sounds like glitter (if that really has a sound) It sometimes incorporates some rare instruments to pair with the intial vibe of the show ex-Saxophone. It also has some traditional instruments that get more engaged with the magic of it all. I think the mixing of the instruments are to mix the idea of the real world and the world the story takes place in.  
Character-  
The characters are VERY cliche. Not that's bad it's just very expected and average. Miaka the lead is often annoying and needy (atleast how i see her.) Typical of shoujo though for having her wait for her knight in shining armor. Tamahome is also very typpical of his suspected role ie; overly protective, compassionate, always is serious about loving Miaka Blah Blah Blah. But of course almost all the male leads want to ""have their way"" with Miaka....OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT!!!! I wish they could've been more original with this idea....  
Enjoyment-  
Overall I really liked this series having it's hiccups here there it's still a good solid watch. Nothing ground breaking but something plausible enough to be memorable.   
Overall-  
Good Points-  
Original storyline (at the time)  
Engaging Story  
Solid listen in both languages  
Good Humor 
Solid soundtrack  
Bad Points-  
Predictable Story  
Animation could've better  
Story often can have some pacing problems   
VERY Mellow dramatic

    Its almost impossible for me to express how much I love this anime just in a review... This anime was and is very inspirational! The plot had me beyond the edge of my seat! The characters are all so colorful and different, they make you laugh and make you cry. Speaking of crying, I could raise the sea level back up with the amount of tears I shed for this anime. But I laughed so hard at so many of the scenes! Every second of this INCREDIBLE anime was worth while! I'd say that this anime has all the elements of what makes a great anime great. The story line is just so unbelievably addicting!!! I might sound a bit over enthusiastic but you know how (almost) every anime fan has that one anime that they just go crazy for? This is mine. And oh my gawd am I CRAZY for it. :) WATCH IT!!!

    this is a really great anime to watch. Even though the whole concept of having a time traveling protagonist, the warrior guy versus the oji-sama, having rivalries between the protagonist and the best friend that ends up as an antagonist because of hilarious love triangle, and some weird characters that appears in the midst of the story. 
 But still for me there are lot of off spins that happened in the story. Of how they manage to go back to the real world and how the love story of miaka and tamahome ended. The sound was really great.  
And also the OVA is some how really hard to get ( the flow of the story) if you don't watch it!

    Fushigi Yuugi was the first Anime i ever watched and in the four years since then have watched it nearing on fourty times. This Anime though at the begining seems a little average and you will most likely think ""ive seen it all before"" is actually amazing! The further the story goes the more you love it. You fall in love with the characters and will cry, laugh, and no doubt you will be moved by this anime.  
The story becomes more and more intricate and every time you think its all going to be okay it takes a turn for the worst. This anime keeps you gripped all the way through the two series, and while i must admit the second series is much better the first series is definately not to be missed just because it is still funny and you need that time to get to know and understand the fantastically thought out characters. 
Do not look over this anime it is astounding and ever since i watched this i have become hooked on anime well and truly.

    this anime is an anime with a lot of unexpected things that happened in the end,but like most/all animes they end up with a happy ending.this story is full of shoujo,comedy,romance,action,adventure and a little bit of suspense.its based on the 28 constellations,the 4 gods,4/2 students/girls that found a mysterious book with a different world inside of it and each god that has 7 celestial wariors that guards their priestess in order for their priestess to be granted 3 wishes by their god,but mostly in the anime series it is mostly all about the 2 girls named yui and miaka that found a book leading them to a different dimension where they fought war,found love and friendship,but most importantly they learned how it feels to lose the people you loved most. 
but in the end they understoosd each other and found peace in their land.yet,their is more to come....at the beggining of it all.

    I went into this anime not expecting much and I think that is why I enjoyed it so much. If I had to sum it up; if this seems like the type of anime that you would dislike, then you will dislike it. If it seems like the type of anime you will enjoy then you won't necessarily enjoy it. 
STORY- 6 
It's a very typical story for this kind of show and it doesn't really do anything outstanding. One thing that really spiked my enjoyment for this show is how it handled it's cliff hangers. I think they were timed perfectly, I just had to watch the next episode, despite it not really being that mindblowing. 
However! What the show does, it does well. It's satisfying to watch and I personally never really felt like it was wasting all that much time. Although the middle was a bit more boring than the rest of the show, the show never really gets back to square one, nor does it have any arcs that don't have anything to do with the main plot. 
One thing that was almost funny was the show's fanservice. Sex is very much a thing in this show and it is discussed at length, (it can be a bit insensitive at times for today's standards) with one of the plot points being the main character's virginity status. But this definitively isn't a hentai or even an ecchi really, it truly is fanservice for its target audience: young teenage girls. 
ART- 4 
The weakest part of the show. But, to be perfectly honest with you, sometimes I just want to have something on while doing other stuff. so the lack of pretty visuals REALLY didn't bother me... This was the perfect show to just have on in the background, look at the screen once in a while, while doing homework and other tasks. 
If anything, it is refreshing to watch an older show once in a while, if just for a change of pace. 
The art isn't good. But I wouldn't have it any other way. 
SOUND- 7 
I actually liked the soundtrack. Again, it might just be the change of pace with this being an older show, but the opening and ending are enjoyable to listen to and I never really felt the need to skip them. The show has a tendency to play character songs, which you know.... It never really does make the sad moments sadder. 
I will listen to the soundtrack later on youtube to see if I like it separately, but it again is nothing special. 
CHARACTERS- 5 
Here we get to the part that might be a deal-breaker to many people. Miaka, the main character, she is well... annoying. I personally did not find her that annoying, but I know that is how many people describe this type of character. The closest comparison would be Usagi (or Serena, whatever floats your boat) from sailor moon. I think those two even share a voice actor, that's how archetype-y Miaka is. 
She is a glutton, lazy, dumb and a damsel in distress, who just needs to help out despite not being able to contribute, because damnit, we need to further the plot somehow!! But she has a heart of gold and always does her best to do the right thing. Yeah... that kind of character. 
I personally don't find this type of character to be that annoying, because... yeah, I am like that too lol. And I really don't think she is the worst that this archetype has to offer, but you should stay away if this kind of thing bothers you. 
I think that Yui Hongo is WAAYYY worse of a character than Miaka, but I'd have to go into spoilers as to why. Let's just say that the story doesn't do her any favours; she isn't allowed much room in the role the story assigned her and it makes her actions seem unreasonable. 
The villain was mediocre. 
The best characters were definitively Miaka's brother and his best friend, they were pretty funny. 
All the other characters are OK I guess, no favourites here. (Although Hotohori is definitively better than Tamahome, just saying) 
ENJOYMENT & OVERALL- 7 & 6 
Enjoyable is the best way to describe this show. I enjoyed it, it was nice to have on in the background, but it is not really a favourite nor is it good enough that I would go out of my way to recommend it to people. I think you definitely need to have a taste for this kind of show to enjoy it and if you don't think you are that type of person, then I would stay away.

    I can understand why so many people gave low ratings to this anime while some gave higher ones. It mainly depends on your preferences as well as your gender. This is a shoujo type anime. If you're not into shoujo - fantasy romance, then don't watch this, or you'll only get annoyed. 
Okay, so personally, I am a shoujo fan and I absolutely love reverse harem type series. So I definitely enjoyed reading the original FY mangas and when they've announced it was going to have an anime adaptation I literally flipped. I was so excited! 
The series started with Miaka, the MC getting sucked in a magical book and became the main heroine who needs to find the 7 celestial warriors of Suzaku (all handsome men) in order for her to save the world. I know, i know! this sounds really cliche as there are thousands of other animes right now which all have a similar theme. But as a series that was published/ aired during the early 90's - I could say it was somehow Fushigi Yuugi that started it all.. this anime (for me anyway) was definitely fresh.  
It's every girls dream - the absolute fantasy for normal highschool girls to escape the highs school cramming life and live in another world surrounded by hot men who' are all dying to be with you. I mean, come on! Let's be honest here, ladies!  
Alright, so although the MC and her love interest Tama can get a little annoying sometimes with their lovie-dovie scenes, the story was actually quite good. the fight scenes were entertaining, and the setting was beautiful. What made me stick watching this anime though were not the main characters but the side characters... they are all extremely likable (even the villains), and they are the type of side characters that mattter in the story line.  
The art was breathtaking as expected, it is created by Yuu Watase after all. Her works are definitely my fav since I was 15 and now that I'm on my late 20's her works are still number one in my book. As a shoujo mangaka, her characters are too perfect you can't help but fall inlove with them. The music in the anime were pretty good for its time too. Wakatte-ita hazu was my personal favorite, younger kids nowadays might not appreciate these types of tracks now but back in the day this was nearly the epitome of shoujo themes. 
If it's your first time watching this show, I would suggest watching the original japanese voice dubs, the english ones are a bit annoying. I do admit, I started watching the english dub myself and then watched another round with the japanese ones & trust me, it definitely made a huge difference. There are just some dialogues that sounds really CHEESY in the english dub but not in japanese. Also, the humor in this series is a lot funnier in japanese and just a major EUGH in english.. it annoyed the hell out of me.  
Overall experience, I loved it! It's the best shoujo anime I have watched all my life. Even now that I'm older, re watching it again still gets me all pumped up and excited each episode. I've always been a fan Yuu Watase's works, her Universe of the Four Gods fantasy lore though takes the cake as one of the best reverse harem fantasy shoujo stories ever. Now if we can only get an anime adaptation of her Genbu Kaiden then my life would be complete! ^_^

    I do not know what anime is until watching this. It was tele-casted in ANIMAX in India, every Saturday from 11:00 AM to 12:00PM during year 2001. At that time I was studying degree and I started bunking classes for watching this anime. To reach home from my college I have to take a bus and it would take lot of time to reach home. Thus I used to get home by an autorikshaw by paying whatever amount the autodriver asked me, only to watch it. 
The story starts with two friends miyaka and her friend lui went to a library where miyaka accidentaly opens a book and both of them get drawn into the other world that is inside the book. 
      I got fascinated by the story itself. It was first time for me to see a fantasy story. What I liked the most was how well each of the characters helped one another. But I was just little bit worried why all of the characters are falling for Miyaka. I was so thrilled when Miyaka's brother also guides her from outside of the book. I liked the way the story ended. My personal favorites are prince hotahori, tomahome and the sage ( I forgot his mane though). Moreover this is the anime in which I felt sympathetic towards nakago. Its admirable on part of the writer to  show the other side of a villain. It makes one to understand that a villain is not made by whim of impulsive actions rather than by the circumstances or bitterness built up in him because of  negative circumstances in his early life. 
     Its been more than 12 years but still I remember some of the names well.  The title song and the ending song too were amazing.  
In an equation if I have to describe this anime is "" 
fuhigi yuugi = fantasy+adventure+love+friendship+perfect ending. 
I can say that this anime is mother to inuyasha kind of stories.

    This was my first manga book that I truly enjoyed, I got it when I 15 (now 16). When I found that there was an anime I had to watch it and I wasn't disappointed at all. It was all so gripping and my emotions were taken on a rollarcoaster because the anime was that good at bringing out the empathy in me.  
My favourite character was Tamahome because he is so brave and dashing, and my favourite leading lady is Miaka of course, because she reminds me so much of me.  
I think Yuu Watase did a wonderful job on the story and the artwork on paper and its amazing how those black and white pictures became so full of life and I could hear what the characters were supposed to hear like.

    personally I thought this anime was absolutely fantastic! however, I think it's the type of anime you're either going to love or hate because it's shoujo it has a lot of romance, comedy etc and I'll admit the romance can get a bit repetitive at times but that's the reason I enjoyed this anime. In my opinion Fushigi Yugi is an anime where the viewer can at least fall in love with one character if not all because I think their characterisations are so accurate to real life.  
As I've said above this anime would be a strong recommendation if you are into that fantasy, romantic and comical genre!

    I watched an episode of this a week when I was in college with a group of girls in our dorm rooms, and every week, we were amply entertained by the insanity of the story. The story is so wild, the characters so over the top, everything just so outrageous, that So Bad It's Good and Go Big or Go Home both equally describe this anime. 
I assume it was pretty groundbreaking and unusual at the time of it's creation and inspired many anime's after it, so for that reason alone, it's worth checking out. But the balls to the wall story is honestly another great reason to watch as well. 
No, I would not say this is a well-written anime. But boy was it a lot of fun.

    This is a story about a girl who is chosen to be able to change the world she is in and go to ancient China. there she meets a man named Tamahome whom she falls in love with. But, everything that happens to her in Ancient China happens to her best friend Yui. Although I haven't watched everything of it, I love it!  
Story: 10/10- The story is unique and filled with humour and romance. The main character gets transported through time with her best friend at first but then she is left all alone in an unknown world. When her best friend gets sent back to the present world she begins to read a book. Everything that she reads in that book happens to the main character. 
Art: 6/10- The art work in in no way shabby, it's just not modern. it is obvious that this anime art style is from the 1990's. But even though its old it is still clear what is happening on screen. 
Sound: 6/10- The voice acting can sound a bit sarcastic at time due to how the voice actors are trying to sound shocked but it isn't to bad. I hardly notice the music in the background but it is appropriate and good. 
Enjoyment: 10/10- This anime was definitely one of my favourites! It is hilarious and has romance! It is my ideal anime to watch. 
Overall: 10/10- I definitely recumbent this anime to you! I think you will have a great time watching it!

    My opinion on fushigi yuugi is that it was a very good anime to watch. The plot was a very good plot with a good romance triangle between miaka, tamahome, and hotohori. Personally I think that miaka could have been given a better power and actually do a little more fighting and defending her self a little bit more because the suzaku seven where always fighting for her even saving her. but that is just my opinion. Overall I loved this anime it must be one of my most favourite animes off all off the ones i have seen so far (and i can tell you now i have watched a lot).

    I found this anime to be very romantic and adventureous at the same time. Not many anime could pull this off but Fushigi Yuugi did. The Main character Miaka Yuuki seems annoying but this made the stroy more enjoyable in a strange way. Thamahome and Hotohori is the guys Miaka loves, They both are eye cany for those girl that like anime men.The story also tells the bond between two childfriend miaka and yui Hongo. 
I love this anime becuase of the well develop characters and the love that develop between both people from two different world.I would recommend this anime to both romantic and adventure lovers.

    In a way this Anime reminds me of InuYasha, falling in to a ancient artefact of some sort and then ending up in a historical world. One episode wasn't enough I wanted to watch more, there were moments when I was on the edge of my seat, there were times that I was on the ground laughing and sometimes I was in tears of joy and sadness. Just finished all of the episode and OVA and now it's over. If you like action comedy with dramatic moments that you would think ""Oh My God!"" with a huge smear of romance, then this is the show for you.

    Brought to us by the same guy who made Ayashi no Ceres, and basically following the same formula to the point I will reuse text from the review I made for it. It another one of those sappy melodramatic shows that made some impression at their time but were otherwise forgotten fast after several other better shows came about. 
Romance is a very specific genre. There is not much variation to how “boy and girl meet” and usually everyone expects the exact same thing to happen in the conclusion. That is why to spice things up, the conditions under which the boy and the girl meet or the ordeals they are going through need to be different each time, in order to at least make the world around the otherwise one-track romance to appear interesting. 
Take this series for example. We have quite the usual fuss. Naive good girl meets mysterious pretty bad boy and falls in love with it 0.13 seconds after they first meet. Why? Well, she is naive, he is a boy, he is pretty, and apparently being bad is quite fascinating if you spent your life pampered and see this as a way to get wild before you grow old and wither away in boredom with some fat, bald poor business man who cares more about football than you. Ok, I understand; it’s been like that in most corny shoujo and it still sells today no matter the stupidity of the whole deal. For more information, check out the success of frakking Twilight . 
STORY SECTION: 6/10 
Analysis: Premise 2/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 2/2 
But that is now and this is, what, twenty years ago; a time when romances were to the most part not happening in space, in the past, or in magic fairylands. Very common today, very rare back then. This anime did not receive its fame because of its romance, which to be honest is following the book of corny romances to the letter. It is about the world around that romance. 
-Let’s have the girl being the reincarnation of a celestial maiden, whose mystical powers can control the forces of the world. 
-Let’s have her knight in shining armor be a super warrior in a magical land and part of her elite followers. 
-Let’s have her best friend tuning out to be her worst rival, because fate requests it and because the villain in the show exploits her emotions. 
-Let’s add a hundred other people trying to exploit, survive or just have fun with all that. 
-Let’s add flashy superpowers. Lots of them. 
-And tears. Lots of tears. 
-And let’s always end the most important episodes with a cliffhanger. 
Yeah, sounds great already. 
So I’m not going to lie, the premise of this anime is amazing, despite being so old. You can focus on different aspects to it instead of just seeing it as yet another corny romance (which it is by the way). 
But let’s try to see a bit deeper than that and check out some things most fangirls … err… viewers don’t notice. The pacing for example has always been the most overlooked aspect of most stories, being left alone to read books home while bijinism and extravagant are out partying like crazy all night with naivety and suspended disbelief. If this poor champ would be noticed for some weird to imagine reason, he would tell you that this series (as well as most others for the same matter) is suffering from tuberculosis. It has a very formulaic way to present its story, some parts are damn boring, some others are hardly affecting the overall, and the finale is a five year old writing Tolkien fanfiction on a napkin… with its mother’s crayon. 
Of course, nobody ever listens to poor old pacing as the fang… fans of such shows are too busy yelling “Kyaaa, Tamahome is so dreamyyyyy!” This example can expand to pretty much any romance by the way, with the only difference being the name yelled. But in some alternative reality of the multiverse where his voice is heard, everyone would agree that the way the story unravels is far from “as dreamy as Tamahome”. 
-Most side stories are hardly affecting the overall plot and yet they are there to slow the pacing. Just imagine four teams of warriors, each one having seven members and yet only one or two in each one matter. And the way the fated couple keeps copping with their ordeals looks too silly at best. 
But it’s not like the story is complete boinkers either. Its main idea expands further beyond the main duo and shows how circumstances can turn an average person to a savior and charismatic leaders being manipulated by shady people to do things they never intended. It is also full of emo characters with colorful personalities and sappy personal drama along with supernatural fights in the likes of Naruto or Bleach. And to its core, it is still a romance, ideal and corny enough to follow with your ears gone out of order because of the constant screams of those fang… fans of romances. 
Bottom line, it is a good story with a messy presentation. It may sound epic at first but it plays out like a soap opera with magic, slapstick humor and mediocre fan service. I consider this anime the forefather of The Twelve Kingdoms, which a decade later managed to gain far more fans by having far more mature presentation (it is was sadly left incomplete). 
ART SECTION: 5/10 
Analysis: General Artwork 1/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 1/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2 
Yup, the visuals are as weak as a harem lead next to a pair of panties. All the attempts at showing cinematics seem poor even considering the age they were made. And the character figures have quite simplistic anatomy and facial structure, being separated only by their hair color or clothes. Of course, this being a romance most will probably only care about how pretty the guys and the gals look (or better say the same guy and gal with different wig and uniform) and won’t give a frakk about the awful way they move… or don’t move at all and stay frozen with a flapping mouth. The manga version could get away with its fluent lining and rather stiff body positions but the anime version is guilty as charged. 
SOUND SECTION: 7/10 
Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 3/4, Sound Effects 2/3 
This part is rather ok. Voice acting is fine (considering how annoyingly sappy the characters are meant to sound) and the songs are ok to listen to many times without feeling fed up with them. At the same time, there is nothing amazing about it either. 
CHARACTER SECTION: 7/10 
Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 2/2, Catharsis 2/2 
The cast is actually quite interesting on paper as there is a plethora of different people with different goals and demeanors and most of them do change or mature or simply get killed. As far as variety goes, there is lots of it and their behaviors are very well excused through their backdrop stories. 
What ruins it is the way they mature / develop, etc. It feels generic in the least and eventually it is all about following what the priestess said. A monologue by some good guy is enough to change one’s worldview immediately while inhuman villains try to look sympathetic to us ten minutes before they kick the bucket. I’m sorry; it’s too sudden to mean anything. As it is with all those characters who seem to matter for one or two episodes and afterwards become nothing but stunts in the team and stall time in the battles. 
Some minor bickering can be said about the main characters as well for being to the most part irritating stereotypes. They do eventually develop of course but considering the amount of air time they get, it feels slow and vein popping to the most part. 
-Miaka for example has nothing special to remember her about. She is aloof and frail when it comes to some hunk near her. She either gets saved by pretty boys or gets super powerful when they are not around; so she survives no matter what happens. She also has a real problem in staying dressed or not being chased around by rapists every ten minutes. And lol at her superpowers going away if she is no longer a virgin; this alone guarantees her purity remaining intact for the whole show. 
-Tamahome is to the most part the stereotypical hunk the heroine is after from the first second they met. He is simply so blunt in whatever he is doing and even most of that has to do with running after Miaka or desperately trying not to deflower her although he really digs her ass. 
-Yui is basically the evil side of Miaka, manipulated by the villain who is basically an evil Tamahome. That’s right, the main antagonists are the dark counterparts of the heroes. What, you expected something more? Anyways, Yui is also a blockhead for becoming her best friend’s nemesis for something she never did. Furthermore, how much of an idiot can you be for not knowing if you got raped or not? 
VALUE SECTION: 3/10 
Analysis: Historical Value 1/3, Rewatchability 1/3, Memorability 1/4 
Um, not much. It is ok the first time you watch it, with those cliffhangers constantly making you yearn for more. But the second time you will most likely skip most of it, since to the most part it plays out as a corny shoujo with corny shounen action. And the premise in general has been used numerous times in later shows with better animation; so tough luck even there. 
ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10 
Analysis: Art 0/1, Sound 0/2, Story 1/3, Characters 0/4 
Good concept, bad pacing, bad animation, irritating personalities. Gets 1 out of 4. But if you are one of those Banshees, you will like it a looooooot more. 
“Tamahomeeee!”

    You'll notice I rated this anime a 6/10 which I know is lower than what most other people rated it, but that's only because I don't think Fushigi Yuugi is that special of an anime. The story isn't original, the characters are simple, and by the end I was bored of watching.  
Story: Miaka was just an ordinary girl until she got sucked into a book and became the priestess of the beast-god Suzaku. Now, in order to fulfill the prophecy, she has to gather the seven warriors of Suzaku in order to save the world and ""make all her dreams come true."" So the anime's driving force is Miaka trying to summon Suzaku, but she can't do it without the seven warriors. When I read the summary of Fushigi Yuugi I thought to myself ""finding the seven warriors is probably going to span the entire anime"", but actually Miaka finds the warriors surprisingly quick, she finds one right after the other with no filler in between.  
However, the biggest problem I have with this anime is all the attention on romance. A lot of the problems the characters face in the anime are solved not with fighting and violence, but with the power of true love. There is some action in the anime, but always the problem they face is ultimately solved with love as in all the characters crying, hugging, and the music getting all soft. Even after the fight is over, Miaka says ""I was so worried about you"" and then more hugging. 
Furthermore, I was shocked how long this anime is, I mean after the main story is over it has three OVA's that total 13 extra episodes! Also, just when I thought Miaka had everything she needed to summon Suzaku, Miaka finds out that she still needs to do something else! 
Characters: If you're the kind of person that likes relationships then you'll love this: Miaka loves Tomahome, but their love is forbidden; Hotohori also loves Miaka, but Nuriko loves Hotohori and Nuriko is gay, but Hothori isn't; Yui loves Nakago, but Nakago is just using Yui; Soi also loves Nakago, but Nakago doesn't love her. Do you think you can follow all these love-triangles? Miaka never stops talking about Tomahome, I actually counted once and she said his name almost 30 times in one episode! ""I love Tomahome"", ""I'm worried about Tomahome"", ""I miss Tomahome."" I'm so sick of romance >:( 
Furthermore, some of these characters have such flat personalities. Chiriko and Mitsukake barely say anything, the writers basically erased Hotohori, and Miaka has to constantly be rescued. You see in anime's picture Miaka's holding that sword, that sword actually belongs to Hotohori and Miaka doesn't even know how to use it so she's useless in a fight.  
Also, it's so obvious that Nakago  is just using Yui so whenever Yui talks about destroying Miaka I just scream ""Miaka never did anything bad to you, you have no reason to want to destroy her, stop acting crazy!"" Seriously, how is that these characters can't tell Nakago is evil, he is pure evil and Yui doesn't seem to notice!  
Overall: This anime is for people that like love stories and soap operas, not people like me who like action and adventure. Only watch this anime if you're a big fan romance and if you aren't then don't torture yourself by watching this anime.

    This anime is a bit old but it rivals (is as good as) any romance anime I've watched till now. 
Miaka, main character- attractive, cute, honest, caring but annoying, is sucked into an ancient book and found herself in plenty of trouble. Well first, she falls in love with Tamahome. Somehow, Miaka is so hot that even the Emperor is in love with her LOL:) There are some love triangles going on, adding spice to the story. 
The (Suzaku) warriors are slowly revealed in an interesting manner. Each has their own tale and attractive personalities. I would say my favourite is Tatsuki- because he adds a lot of comedy besides looking soo hot. Also, he initially was rough and sort of a bad guy. Other than Tamahome, he seems to have actual character depth and development out the the 7 warriors. 
For the Seiryu warriors, my favourite are the twins. The really livened up the story. As you know, Miaka's best friend, Yui became the priestess of Seiryu and so became enemies with Miaka. However, you'll have to watch the anime to find out why Yui went over to the dark side:)  The real bad guy here is Nakago of course- he is smart and manipulative. However, you'll feel sorry for him when you learned of his tragic past. 
Since this anime's setting is in ancient China, the surroundings and clothings will be of that. Think Chinese temples, emperors, etc. Each warrior also has a Chinese character on his forehead. Ironically, the villian Nakago's character represents 'heart' ,while the protagonist Tamahome's character means 'demon'. 
The story is compelling as it is not the usual 'fight the bad guy, save the world type'. A very important part of the story (other than romance) is about friendship. It is really touching to know after all the bad things Yui did, Miaka still forgives her and retain their frienship. 
Overall, the story is great and entertaining. There is a fair bit of fight scenes but violence is kept to a minimum. Lots of drama and suspense moments.  
A word of caution: Miaka and Tamahome will proclaim their eternal love for each other multiple times throughout the anime. Translation: there will be a lot of kissing, hugging, etc. Most of the time it's sweet and cute though:)

    i'm giving this anime a 10. it does sound ridiculous coz it's just another fantasy story but this anime made me the fanatic that i am now. for me, this one started it all. Everything about this anime is just right- right amount of comedy, romance, fantasy, underwear exposure, drama, harem...it has everything. i first seen this anime years ago but i just cant help re-watching it over and over again. i even got some of my friends to watch it and i'm not even surprised that they loved it too. 
the characters are amazing. making it different from one another, having those skills and each characters take and timing were just right. the romace in the story is what's most noticeable. be it the romance between tamahome and miaka or miaka and hotohori and even of yui's and nakago's. it shows the hardships of a couple and how their love get through it all. the love in this anime does not revolve merely around couples, it also shows the love for one's family, friends, comrades and kingdom. the display of powers and skills in every battle is just a plus. just something that would add up to make this anime a masterpiece. it appeals to all kinds of people of all ages. both gender could learn from it. the comedy- for those who doesn't want to be bored i assure you that there is enough punchlines here that will make you laugh. the fight scenes- though not in any tournament or some arena, it does offer some good fights. for the tearjerkers- if crying is your hobby then this anime won't fail you.oh yes, i cried several times too. for the romantics- it doesn't matter whether you're in love, just got out of love, have a one-sided love, super lovey-dovey, secret love even forbidden love i'm sure this anime will get your attention. 
what i hate about it though is the main girl miaka. she's too loud and too stupid yet she still get the boys. this is just too unfair.even yui (her bestfriend) will agree to that. sometimes it makes me wonder, maybe ancient china likes stupid girls since they're unique in their own way. haha but infainess to her, no matter how clumsy she is , she always get the job done. 
and now it comes down to what i love most...it's the guys of course. they are all beautiful with amazing characters.i love the art in this one. tamahome and hotohori are my ideal men.unfortunately none like that exist in the real world.no wonder miaka want to get back inside that book so much.haha  sometimes i wish to be an anime instead because of these guys.haha 
well, i just hope that everyone enjoys fushigi as much as i do.

    So i started watching this anime  and at first i thought ""what an interesting show!"" i like the story line and season one was pretty decent despite some dragging bits. After season two i almost killed myself, the main characters who seemed to have so much power in the first season suddenly are at the mercy of the over-powerful baddies. The love story really f'd up too they really just needed one reason to not be together instead of all sorts of useless side reasons that are solved so quick. I also hate how one sequence, going from spot A to B takes 4 pointless travel episodes with a crap load of foreshadowing and flashbacks, just show me the damn fight! 
Despite all this i really invested myself in the show 52 f'ing episodes does that, and i really liked a few characters but of course they aren't in the second season as much and suddenly there is no comedy left!  As much frustration as i had while watching ie. yelling at the computer, flipping off the douche bags, and skipping to the good parts. I did enjoy the anime enough to finish all the OVA’s which were better than the whole series!!

    I’ll start out by saying this:  Fushigi Yuugi is not for everyone.  It is perhaps the shojoest of the shojo anime series and rivals Nana and Revolutionary Girl Utena.  So if you’re female, there’s an 85% chance that the series will appeal to you in some way, shape, or form.  If you’re male, there’s an 85% chance that you’ll find the series either boring, slow, redundant, or stupid.  If you are male and are in the minority, there’s a chance that you’ll get mocked.  I did at Anime Detour. 
But honestly, there are worse things that you can admit to liking.  The show starts out interesting, and most characters catch your interest by immediately creating an instant impression yet hold your interest by being multi-layered.  You have to keep watching the show to actually see this, since characters change their personalities so often, and the slow pace means that in order to see their entire self, you can’t pick and choose.  The main character, Miaka, may seem a bit naïve at times, but despite her constant dramas with her protectors and with her friend-turned-opponent Yui, she is strong in her own way and able to see the true side of things.  She’s a typical teenage girl, but yet is portrayed to be sensible to a degree.  Her relationship with Tamahome is like a rollercoaster, and will find a lot of appeal for viewers…  and also be the source of ridicule for those who dislike the series *insert drama cry and cues “Get one with it”*.  It’s developed so well that it serves as the perfect centerpiece and there are moments where you cry out for the two of them to get through their problems and be together again.  It just shows that for a relationship to be perfect, it’s not always peaches and cream. 
However, despite the excellent development of the two main characters and most of the secondary characters, there were some characters that seemed to have been shoved in there just for appearance sake and thus weren’t developed very well.  Chiriko, Mitsukake, and Miboshi, among others, just simply had a few lines of dialogue or were only featured in a few episodes before they were taken away from the series altogether.  It’s worse for a shojo series, especially for the protagonists, since they’re treated as walking dolls rather than individuals with depth. 
That said, however, Nakago is simply the perfect villain.  Maybe a little boring (not much in the form of diabolical laughter or Gendo Ikari hand gestures here), but he is a complete asshole.  And in this shojo series, what better weapon to use than sex?  Especially lies about sex.  And it’s way better the clichéd ability showed in the ending battle with Tamahome.  Honestly, despite him being an asshole, without him, the story would collapse and fall into nothingness.  There would be no Seiryu vs Suzaku, Yui vs Miaka, the clash of ideals and the intertwinedness of characters within a faction.  The drama would fade away, turning a color-filled clash of drama, determination, and righteousness into something blander than wallpaper paste. 
And speaking of battles…  though most of them are emotional ones, ones of drama, lies, ideals, broken promises, and obligations to others, the ones that are portrayed are hit-or-miss.  You get your clichéd Nakago who’s stronger than everyone, but also ones where the best weapon is your own head rather than a sword or special ability.  But what really appeals to me is that every one of these battles has a purpose.  It’s to achieve something, and in each one, the only way is forward.  You may get sidetracked, but there’s always a twist thrown in so that a whole new series of events start to happen.  Battles are not for “moving onto the next opponent” (this isn’t Bleach here) but for starting a whole new series of events.  You don’t long for them but you know that another one will be coming up soon as the drama rebuilds back up. 
And of course…  the plot…  ah, yes…  yeah…  think slow…  .hack slow.  In order to like this series, you’ll have to put up with it.  Keep track of the relationships within both factions amongst all the characters and what they have gone through and what they will go through.  It’s a series of thought, angst, happiness, and sadness.  You watch it with your heart and mind open, and within one big plot of trying to summon two gods, there are many subplots of why characters are doing what they are doing, and for whom and what they hope to achieve.  It’s a story of connectivity, and best taken one disc at a time (though tough luck finding them for cheap if you don’t own them already). 
Like I said, it’s not for everyone.  The plot is sluggish, it requires lots of concentration, and the same themes cycle throughout the entire series.  There are lots of things to keep track of, and you can easily get bored.  But the characters (most) are well-developed, the drama keeps you interested, and you’re always wondering what’s going to happen next (presuming you’re interested in the show).  Worth giving a shot for at least the first disc.  Best to watch this over a course of…  several weeks minimum.

     Main   
Fushigi Yuugi is a lukewarm anime series. Obviously compared to the shows of today...but even back then, I can't say that I was as enthralled by it as everyone else. Sure it has it's high points: Lots of action, dramatic tension and bishounen galore...but with all the cheesy canned romantic dialog and all the ill-timed [Sailor Moon-ish] humor seriously detracts from the show's dramatic intensity not to mention, total enjoyment from this show.  
 Art-Style  
I would say say this is the typical 90's style animation...nothing too impressive but it wasn't boring or hideously drawn either. There are a bunch or errors and irregularities with the animation with the way things are supposed to move or fall also with the way characters run and pose. And there were definitely some corners being cut during the action scenes with some minor looping and also with freeze frames....not enough to complain about though, as I said this is very typical of animes from the early to mid 90's anime.  
 Sound  
Expect some pretty dated music from this one. One of the BGM used for the some fight scenes actually sounds like the base track from the song &ldquo;pump up the volume&rdquo;. Some songs weren't too bad for their time tho, like Chiriko's song and the OP Theme. I actually like the very beginning for the OP because it sounds very majestic and then you see the lead female character [Miaka] all dressed up in her priestess robes looking refined. The show was watched in english and I must say that the voices actors did a really really good job on this show, no one had an annoying voice on this show. Best Voice Award goes to Nakago and definitely to that one creepy gay warrior with that kabuki make-up on his face and all the feathers sticking out of his head.  
 Story  
The story has a good beginning and a great ending....but it kind of sags in the middle. Boring, annoying and definitly irritating with all this back and forth with Miaka and Tomohome. All this break up/Make up...Love me/Don't love me BS, very annoying and it spans too many episodes, like one of those epically annoying battle scene from DBZ that spans 14 &ndash; 30 episodes. The other conjoined story lines, like about her and Yui being in the Realm of the Four Gods or the individual dramas of the accompanying seven warriors [or 14 warriors if you count those of the Seiyu Clan] were definitely great and made watching this anime worth it. But also other drawbacks from this story were the excessive chibi use, the screwball Sailor Moon type humor that didn't fit with the high-tension moments and not to mention all the CORNBALL romance lines being used in the show. 
 Cast/Characters  
The bishounen factor is very high [at a very solid 100%] with this series, there is also some SHOUNEN-AI and brief moments of MxM going on up in this anime....so there will be no character complaints coming from me......mmmmmmmmm, well actually Miaka is kind of a do-do head. Anyway they were all drawn very well and looked cute.  
 Worth it or NOT?  
I know many people hold this series in high regard and so those who love it have already bought it. I wouldn't buy this though....for one, I hear Tomohome's name too much. She calls his name like every 5 seconds....and......it's reeeeeeeally annoying! If I played a drinking game based off of how many times I heard her call his name...Tomohome, Tomohome, I'd die of alcohol poisoning!!!

    First off, I'm going to start with the fact that I finished this anime, all 52 episodes and I'm still not sure why. I couldn't stand most of the characters, the art is outdated, the story is decent but there are so many stupid tropes and situations that I stopped watching it several times throughout the series. 
But I returned to finish it. Why? Because despite the annoying characters, painful voice acting, and dumb tropes, it has a weird sort of charm. Maybe I'm just nostalgic for shows I watched in my childhood (mainly Inuyasha, actually) but I actually enjoyed it.

    The most redeeming part of this story is that it does not end with the realization of the protagonists' love of each other.  Miaka and Tamahome become involved in a relationship and continue to evolve in that relationship over time.   The concept that all interesting life experiences don’t end with falling in love is clearly presented and that is a worthy message. 
While this may have been an early form of the 'priestess stolen from another world to save an ancient city' theme, it was by no means the best I have seen.  The characters were interesting and had potential, however, the main character was clothed in piety in order to hide that she was truly ignorant and selfish.  She cried a lot about how people around her got hurt and how she wasn't any good at doing things and then would run off alone, forcing her companions into danger and giving them all kinds of needless obstacles in protecting her.  Then, when they acted in a similar fashion she was hurt and confused.  If the point is that sacrificing yourself to alleviate your own feelings of guilt and fear is counterproductive and only gets people hurt, then this is a good lesson.  But Miaka is only seen as more loving and benevolent after these choices and continues to make them throughout the series.  And Miaka’s friends continue to take the brunt of her poor choices.   
Yui’s reaction to her struggles was unbelievable.  She and Miaka had known each other since kindergarten and still, when it came to believing Miaka, Yui blindly takes the word of a stranger she had known for only a few months?  This is instigated because when Yui is taken into the book, she is attacked.  She knows how little knowledge and ability that Miaka has and in all the times Miaka was attacked Yui was powerless to help her.  Yet, because Miaka didn’t magically come when Yui called her Yui hates Miaka for it.  Then, Yui blames Miaka for having people to save her when she entered the world, but the only thing difference between their experiences was that Miaka protected herself against the thugs before she was saved by Tamahome, whereas Yui did not protect herself before Nakago came.  Beyond that Nakago never hid is cruelty or manipulation of others from her, so he was obviously not the good guy type.  It would have been more believable if they had claimed Yui had been envious of Miaka from the start of their friendship.  Either way, the character reactions to almost everything were over dramatized and unrealistic. 
Ultimately this anime tried hard, but falls short of anything beyond mediocre entertainment.  It reinforces a lot of poor judgments and makes unrealistic conclusions about consequences.  But it was not all bad so I gave it a grade of average.

    I see this anime has quite good notes, so i think I should add my opinion. 
I've seen some anime by now, and I have to tell that they aren't a lot of series that were such a pain to watch like this one. I mean I'm not a big fan of shoujo or romance, but to be honest: it's not the point. 
Story isn't bad. I like fantasy, magic, alternative worlds etc. Maybe it's not super duper complicated but I don't have too high expectations either.  
Art 
Well, let's say Pierrot.  
But not Naruto-like, a little bit better than usually. Drawing was like you should expect from 13 years old anime. Animation in fights  is so-so, scenes are colorful... 
Sound 
Opening and ending aren't anything special. Soundtrack? I didn't notice, nut maybe it's better. 
Characters 
It's the biggest vice here. Romance thread is really important here so, unfortunately, we have to cope with main character Miaka all the time. Miaka is an idiot. First she resembled me Usagi form Sailor Moon: she eats a lot, she's cute (but not pretty anyway), but she's even more hopeless and helpless. But it's not a reason to do nothing, right? So Miaka doesn't listen to anybody who ask her to wait or stay somewhere and then she tries to fight enemy alone and then she's captured and then rest of team have to rescue her. It happens over and over a-gain. Miaka is indecisive too. She love Tamahome and wants to spend all her life by his side only to realize taht their relationship is impossible and break up in the next episode. Later they make-up but not for too long. Reasons are always the same. Rest of characters isn't bad, but there's too much of Miaka and her problems in 52 episodes. 
Enjoyment: it was a pain. Reason is mentioned above. 
Well, my english isn't good enough to express all my feelings, negative I guess, but I think you have to watch it yourself. How you will rate it depends IMO on your gender prefrences and audience's sex.

    Before this series, I've only seen harem anime like Tenchi Muyo and things like that. But it was suggested to me that I watch this series by Yuu Watase. I'm so glad I listened. 
The main character, Miaka, got a little annoying at times but I thought she was cute with Tamahome. Many watchers, at least the ones I know got sick over how much they were all over each other. But what do you expect? This girl was in a time she wasn't from. She was always attacked or in danger and she had no one else to really turn to. He was the one she trusted the most. I thought their relationship was cute. 
Her friend, Yui had to calm down though. She went into total pms mode...and for what? Just because Miaka got her crush? And for the times Miaka wasn't able to get to her, it wasn't her fault. Miaka just didn't know how to use her powers...whatever those may be. But I do understand that Yui was also scared....but she was supposed to be the smarter of the two. Didn't she stop to think things through? Or was it because of Nakago? Though his story made me cry.... 
But anyway, for the harems that these two girls had.... 
I liked almost everyone in Miaka's group except for Chiriko and Mitsukake. The kid annoyed me and he really didn't do much. Mitsukake was alright but not a favorite. The other guys had life to them and their stories were so sad. T-T But my absolute favorite was Nuriko. He was just too awesome for words. (And too beautiful too xD; ) 
For Yui's group, it was the twins. Everyone else had pretty much psycho issues.... Nakago was just a conniving evil dude but I'll admit it...he was pretty. xD; Tomo would have been okay but he's way psycho....  
The character developments were good in the aspect of each one developing like a life of their own. They weren't all similar but weren't all that extreme either. It was a nice variety among them. And I thought the voices were perfect for each character. Of course I love Hotohori's....his being Koyasu Takehito. (the man does 100's of voices lolz) 
The animation was nice, given the time it was created. I always liked hand-drawn as opposed to all the ones done on computer today... -_-;;;;; It just gives the show a different feeling. Especially if the story itself is supposed to be another time, like in the past.  
Overall, I think it was a great series. I actually cried at the end! I felt for the characters that were lost. And the story was just great. I loved how the creator utilized legends and made a good romance. Kinda' makes girls wish they could find a book like the &amp;quot;Universe of the Four Gods&amp;quot; (only without all the scary parts xP ).  
I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a romance series that's not too depressing but not so bubbly and happy. It has a good amount of everything. Definitely watch!

    Fushigi Yuugi, originally a manga written by Yuu Watase, is a classic anime, that became so popular, it inspired 3 OAV series', and encouraged Watase to write the prequel to the series, more than 10 years later. 
Story 
Fushigi Yuugi: The Mysterious Play, is about a 15 year old girl Miaka Yuuki, and her best friend Yui Hongo. Miaka and Yui are in the library when Miaka sees a mysterious bird lead her to the restricted room of the library. There, Miaka finds a mysterious book, and her and Yui are pulled into the world. Miaka and Yui meet a mysterious man who saves them from slave traders, but Yui is thrown back out of the book, and the man has left, leaving Miaka all alone in this Ancient Chinese world. Miaka meets with the man again, and they end up at the palace, and through circumstances, Miaka is charged with the duty to gather together the seven senshi of Suzaku, and save Konan from destruction! 
I know that makes no sense, but in a nutshell, Miaka fell into Konan, an Ancient Chinese world, where the whole world lives on the idea of the Four Gods in Chinese Mythology. Miaka is in the south, where Suzaku, the Red Bird (Pheonix in some translations) protects the country. Each God has 7 constellations (or in this case, the 7 senshi). So the constellations have taken the form of 7 warriors, and Miaka needs to gather them to summon Suzaku, who will grant her 3 wishes. 
Animation 
The animation itself is smooth, and well done, until about the second season (ep 27+) where the animation seems to take a bit of a plunge at times. The colouring is also very vibrant at times, but others, it's very muddy looking, and monotone, because everything seems to be in the brown colour tone, except the hair of Miaka's senshi. The most remarkable thing in the animation, however, is the eyes. When the animators but their mind to it, they draw some beautiful, bright, colourful eyes. 
The music in this falls into an olden style theme, mostly Chinese sounding. However, they have their theme, and ending theme that do not fit that theme. And one thing you need to know about Fushigi Yuugi, is if you want to hear more of it's music, be prepared for trumpets. Lots of trumpets. 
Anyways, the theme song is fairly slow at first, but then seems to almost have dance feel to it. It's nothing remarkable. The ending theme, however, is a dance song, but also has a fairly sad tone to it, fitting the series well, I feel. 
The voices, English and Japanese, I have to mention, are wonderful. I love it in both languages. The voices fit the parts perfectly. 
Character 
There is a whirlwind of characters. Be prepared to remember some names. The main characters are essentially Miaka, Yui, Tamahome, and Nakago, but you have the supporting cast (that consists of atleast 12 senshi, only including the Suzaku and Seiryuu), and about 13 more characters I can name off the top of my head. 
While most characters have well-done development, because of the mass amount of characters, some of these character appear almost personality-less, most notably two of Miaka's senshi, Chiriko and Mitsukake, and two of the Seriyuu senshi, Tomo and Miboshi (I'm not counting Ashitare because he practically never talks, and well... if you want to sure, he has no personality I suppose). Watase herself never really developed these characters, so they continue to suffer, even onto OAV's, and even in their songs. But for the characters she does focus on, they are all very different, and it's not hard to pick a favourite. 
Enjoyment 
For all the bad things I have said, this series has an amazing fanbase, and I personally think it has high replay value. Everytime you watch the series, you find something you missed, but I remember the first time I saw this, and I was an addict, most literally. I couldn't wait for them to release the next VHS (and boy did they have alot... 14). I know of people that do dislike this series, but for the most part, everyone has something about this they liked, and it usually lies in the characters themselves, particularily the senshi. 
C'mon, for a series that spawned so much merchandise, character songs, OAV's, etc, how can it not be enjoyable? 
Well yeah, the OAV's aren't enjoyable, but the series itself is fun to watch over and over again. 
Overall / My Comments / My Feelings 
The story is a bit different from the manga, and justifies this beginning a bit more. Miaka and Yui are pulled in to the book world, but they both return (in the anime, it's only Yui). Miaka gets in an agruement with her mother, and runs back to the library, getting pulled into the book again to set her free of the pressures of her real life. The manga honestly has a stronger beginning, and gives you more sympathy for Miaka as the protagonist. 
Even though my above comments aren't the best, this is me looking at it critically. If you don't, and just watch it for enjoyment, I can guarentee anyone who loves the romance genre of anime will like this. 
Yes, Miaka and Tamahome can be terribly annoying. They are my least favourite characters after all... But the first time I watched the series, I LOVED those two, it's just been 9 years since my first watching, and I've developed a series dislike for their constant crying for each other. 
I know I sound negative, but I do recommend this series to anyone. Anyone. It's a classic, and for it's time, it was an incredibly original plot. (Yes, we know in Inu Yasha that Kagome travels between worlds, however, Fushigi Yuugi predates Inu Yasha quite a few years.  Fy being originally published in the '92 region and manga, while Rumiko was making Ranma 1/2 still at that time (she published the first Ranma in '93) so it's not possible that InuYasha could be more original than FY, because it wasn't made at the same time. It's possible Rumiko could have gotten ideas at that point (I can't find the year for InuYasha)). 
ANYWAYS, just watch Fushigi Yuugi. I'm going so off track here, because I like talking about how original the series is, and how much I love the characters. (Me? I'm a Tasuki fangirl)

    After seeing so much anime in my time, I can say that Fushigi Yuugi might have inspired a lot of anime that came in when it ended. These days there are so much anime that are about the main character/s sucked into another dimension and they are the chosen ones to fix the problems of this so-called dimension (Kyo Kara maoh, Escaflowne, Izumo. etc) 
Although it is one of my favorite series, there are some parts that to me are considered unsatisfactory. I feel a bit sorry for Chiriko because he was one of the lesser important seishis (the other would be Mitsukake). I am not a fan of Chiriko or Mitsukake, but I do think that they could've used more screen time. 
I also noticed some discrepancies. It could be due to translation errors, but I'll say it anyway. There was an episode where Keisuke and Tetsuya go to the Genbu shrine. They went there to see the Byakko miko. One question: why is the Byakko miko in the Genbu and not the Byakko shrine? 
I have to mention that I watched the english dubbed version, because I found certain voice dubbers annoying. I hate Tomo's voice - it is the most annoying voice I have ever heard in my life. Whoever thought of making Tomo's voice sound that way was nuts and should be locked up in an asylum. Miaka was also a bit annoying. I cringe whenever she would cry out Tamahome's name. 
And now for the positives. I love the story - I think it is well thought of. It was able to mix in elements such as love, friendship, deceit, war, etc. into something really decent and worth watching. I first watched the show 6 years ago, and when I watched it again last month I find myself obsessed once more. 
The visuals weren't bad either - although I can't say if I prefer seeing genitals on Yui and Miaka. Seeing naked people is bad enough. However, the show is filled with bishonens throughout the show. My personal favorite is Nuriko of course. He is my god. The wonderful art shown at the end of the show via the ending theme was beautifully made and I never grew tired of it. 
The music wasn't bad - most of it were mid 90s music, so I can't say I'm a huge fan of it. I do like the ending song, &quot;Tokimeki no Doukasen&quot;. It's another one of those nostalgic song for me - everytime I hear it I can't help but feel reminiscent of the year when I first watched Fushigi Yuugi. Some of the insert songs weren't bad either. Again they were mid 90s styled, but they're not so bad. I did get tired of the opening song after a while. Hearing &quot;Maiagare Suzaku&quot; for more than 10 times tends to get on my nerves. 
I think one reason why the show was suspended on Filipino free TV was because of mild sex and vulgar language. This is definitely not for kids, but I would say it is a must - see for the 16+ crowd (mostly because I saw the show when I was 16).

    Though by some standards today, the story may seem a bit clich&eacute;, but for its time in the mid-1990s, it wasn&rsquo;t really that much of the norm. So the Alice in Wonderland concept may not be something that will appeal to everyone since you&rsquo;ve already seen it in more semi-mainstream animes in comparison to this one such as 12 Kingdoms, Inuyasha, and Escaflowne which came out after Fushigi Yuugi though this was the anime that did it before it became something semi-common. Even though this is primarily shoujo, the well diverse but archetypical cast do have mass appeal.  
Each character for the most part has their own unique use and contribution to the story and they are presented in ways you get to know them. The characters or heck, maybe even one character will grow on you as you watch from start to finish. I would explain this, but it would be a significant spoiler, and if you&rsquo;ve seen this anime, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Whether that character is good or bad, you&rsquo;ll love them. Hell, my favorite character Nakago is the primary antagonist and even Yuu Watase, the original manga-ka has admitted that Nakago is her favorite character.  
The anime will hopefully satisfy men and women. The story overall is very diverse with its appeal, but it went a little longer than it should have, but it ends in a way where everything is resolved and the characters wonderfully develop. It has romance, adventure, excitement, comedy and action, which I will further get into. However, what will annoy male and female alike is the interaction between Tamahome and Miaka when they really get romantic with each other. It kind of drags and we don&rsquo;t need that much hugging even if we can appreciate how much they love each other.  
Well, the character design today doesn&rsquo;t really stand out in comparison to most shoujo out there for the most part. The costume designs are a little flamboyant for the setting, but even so, they still compliment the character designs very well where it helps make them stand out a bit more. The action is well coordinated, technical and raw which will appeal to male viewers. The city settings captures the heart of ancient China very captivatingly and truly represents their culture at that time period where they gathered to worship the emperor. However, with the modern day settings, you get a different approach to the school uniform with the blazer and ribbon design you see in lets say Evangelion, than the more mainstream sailor uniform which I thought was unique to anime in the mid-1990s with Magic Knight Rayearth and Sailor Moon being the rage back then with those designs, so its nice to see something different. It is also unique to point out in the real world in Fushigi Yuugi, nobody has crazy color hair, but in the book, you got the typical crazy color anime hair which was somewhat of the intention of Watase and the staff at Studio Pierrot. So overall, the art may be descent, but the character design 100% stand out, but the action, costumes, and scenery makes up for it. 
The dub of Fushigi Yuugi does have some credible names, but I don&rsquo;t think the dub was good. First off, Tamahome is played by David Hayter who you may know as the voice of Solid Snake from MGS. When you hear that voice in relation to Tamahome&rsquo;s image, it just doesn&rsquo;t match. He makes Tamahome sound gruffy, though it&rsquo;s not the voice he uses for Solid Snake, but when he does scream, he does scream like Snake. This kind of casting is to me, for the sake of casting a big name and you&rsquo;re giving him a character he&rsquo;s not appropriate for. However, this was a role I thought perfectly suited his Japanese counterpart, Midorikawa Hikaru, the voice of Heero Yuy from Gundam Wing, and Rukawa from Slam Dunk. Granted Midorikawa has played character opposite from Tamahome, he had a different kind of cool that Snake has, but he still has that passion and soft side that really captures him. As a matter of fact, Watase actually wanted him to play Tamahome because he had him in mind when he created the character. 
I also enjoyed Kae Araki the voice of Sailor Chibi Moon as Miaka. She does sound annoying with her high-pitched voice, but it was at a certain tone where it really captured the character with all of these emotions whether sad, happy, concerned, or excited. And Seki Tomokazu, my 2nd favorite seiyuu who has played Miyata in Hajime no Ippo, Domon in G Gundam, Kamui in X The Movie, and many others was great as Chichiri, my 2nd favorite character. He is so multi-talented and he demonstrates it very well when you get to know his character more. Overall, the cast is just top notch and they all have great chemistry. Even though the romantic tension between Tamahome and Miaka gets annoying, their seiyuus truly make it believable. 
The opening theme song Itoshii Hito no Tame Ni does open with this more traditional approach and then at the right moment, transitions to a more energetic J-Pop song. It&rsquo;s very unique to me because it captures the cultural and romantic atmosphere of the series. And the ending theme Tokimeki Doukasen has a different kind of energy that is generic but still catchy and semi sexually suggestive in a more innocent sense. The background music is well orchestrated in every sense. Such as traditional Chinese music, more traditional cinematic. 
Anyway, I think this is an anime I believe you should try to give a chance even if it may not be your taste. There are all kinds of good qualities this anime has that does make up for its bad ones. Even so, the bad qualities are still there but if you concentrate and stick to what you like, you&rsquo;ll forget about them. I remember during the days of VHS fansubs, I used to talk to people who cried watching this series. It has all of these great themes such as love, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal and they are presented in a very realistically approachable manner. And believe me, there are moments where you might and I&rsquo;m not ashamed to admit I have watching this series. The only anime that has achieved me to react like this since is the Kimura vs Mashiba oav of Hajime no Ippo.

    First off, Full Metal Panic! is based off mecha. These particular mecha are called Arm Slaves and are characterized by their generally bulky shape and protruding forehead (although the more power ones are, of course, pretty sleek). The story mainly revolves around Sousuke Sagara and his girlfriend (but he won't admit it) Kaname Chidori. At first glance, the bright, happy coloring of Full Metal Panic! belies the serious tone of this series. Sousuke and Kaname are involved in numerous twists and turns and intricate relationships with others. 
The action scenes are frequent and very engaging. Fast movement combined with all the wonders of mech warfare are present and freely used. In a way, Full Metal Panic!'s combat is more interesting than the combat in the Gundam series, probably because conventional weapons (tanks, helicopters, mines) pose a sizable threat to Arm Slaves as well. Some of the battles are also used to advance character development. 
And character development itself is very well done. While at as subtle and permeating as Death Note (well, not many anime are), one can definitely see the conflicting desires and motivations of the characters. Sousuke is one-of-a-kind in his stiff military-man mannerisms while being oblivious to others' feelings; he frequently ends up being in the center of a comical situation. Kaname is most similar to Rosette Christopher from Chrno Crusade with her energetic way of speaking and acting, but is more violent (especially with the paper fan).  
The art style, when compared to White Album, Gundam 00, Ef: A Tale of Memories/Melodies, and other recent anime, seems a little dated. However, it is more than adequate, and one will no longer even notice the art style once the bullets and missiles start flying. The girls still look great, facial expressions still pull through, and explosions are still brutal and fast. The development team also made use of some computer animations, especially with Tuatha De Danaan. 
Overall, this anime is a gem among viewers who wish to watch a more mature and dark anime. The action alone makes it worthwhile. Highly recommended for both casual and hardcore anime watchers.

    I, um... I'm going to stop writing reviews for a while after this one because honestly, this series was hard for me. Nothing about it stood out and more often than not I expected the MC to yell ""KAGOME!!"" in place of the lead female's actual name. I can't suggest this series to anyone who wants to be entertained.  
The story is about a 16-year-old girl in Japan who falls into a well and discovers she's been transported back in time to the feudal era where apparently demons existed but don't in the modern era. She discovers a demon named Inuyasha bound to a tree by an arrow and fre- Oh, what? That's a different series? Then what the Hell is this? 
Full Metal Panic follows Sousuke Sagara (Who I will now rename Soggy Sausage), a member of a ""top-secret"" military organization that everyone with a laptop and a wifi connection knows about. He is sent to protect the token tsundere from some mean enemy military people because she's the key to a weapon they already have in their possession and their leader has the same power as her and is military-trained making the whole thing rather pointless WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE SO STUPID? 
If you expected me to review this series' characters (the military personnel in particular) as good, you were hopeful. Unfortunately, I had to suffer through 24 episodes of someone who somehow functions well enough in a strict military structure to rise through the ranks, but can't figure out why stalking someone in broad daylight is a problem. Oh, and the tsudere starlet doesn't help since her reactions are what you would get from someone with Borderline Personality Disorder and not a rational, reasonable-minded person.  
What side characters? Oh, you mean those walking tropes almost every other series has? Those forgettable members of the cast that if they died and were replaced with a plank of wood you wouldn't notice? Yeah, even the villain exists to just be there. The climatic final fight scene is... Boring. I've watched mecha anime like Bokurano, Code Geass, and even Gurren Lagann and the first one despite the slowness of how the damned thing moved was more entertaining that whatever FMP was trying to do.  
The music isn't there. I don't remember it and looking on youtube just doesn't strike me as a fruitful endeavor. The opening just feels out of place or maybe because the entire thing is a mess it just doesn't work. Nothing about the characters, the story, or the art draws you in and it's unfortunate because the art is similar to that of Escaflowne (Probably a product of the industry at the time). Nothing about this series is meant to appeal to anyone but a crowd of hiveminded persons who consider Inuyasha a masterpiece.  
If you're still curious, go watch Blood+. At least you'll find something to enjoy there.

    The FMP universe is, as of now, still an incomplete one, though a pretty good mech-based contender. The first FMP, in my opinion, is the weakest of the works, but nonetheless is required viewing if you want in on the series. 
Sosuke is part of Mithril, a secret organization dedicated to protecting the planet from terrorism with technology and armament far surpassing that of any nation. 
FMP is a mech/action about Sosuke who is sent to protect a high school girl, Chidori, who unknowingly possesses amazing technological knowledge. Overall, the series is pretty good but is overshadowed by the grandeur of it's successors (Fumoffu and TSR). This is also one of the first shows that I'd watched so please bear with my minimalist review. 
Personally I think the mechs look strange and, well, unappealing. The characters are also somewhat odd at first, but I overcame that. Those aside, the general animation is done fairly well and the colors reflect the mood of the series. Expect a good dosage of action and a bit of gore. 
The OP was fairly good but I didn't like the ED that much. The background music also wasn't anything that memorable. Voice acting is the only plus here with the two main characters (Chidori and Sosuke) having superb voice actors. 
There is a sharp contrast between the real battle world for Sosuke where death is a daily reality and the innocent high school life of Chidori. 
The plot basically has Sosuke fighting to protect Chidori from various foes, and certain fights are quite intense. There isn't really a conclusion, more of a settling down after the climax, which makes sense since TSR takes place right after. 
Sosuke is an amazing character. Not only is he highly trained and knowledgeable about military technology and mechs, he is also completely clueless regarding civilian life. This makes for a great deal of humor. His antics with Chidori alone make this an above average show. 
Value: 
While the show was entertaining and exciting at times, it is neither as intense as TSR nor as humorous as Fumoffu. Therefore, it serves only as the base and background for the latter two series.

    Full Metal Panic is for those who want action with mechs, but not have the show only revolve around war and battles, and FMP accomplishes that flawlessly. 
FMP is about an Organization called Mithril that are something like celestial being from gundam 00 for those that have seen it.  They intervene in things so that wars dont happen.  But they are also out to protect certain people with the natural gift of knowledge of advanced technology called Whispered. 
The main character is what makes this show so interesting.  His whole life he has known nothing but military life and now he tries to adapt to japanese high school life in order to protect a certain girl.  Of course all the other characters are a great enjoyment to have in the show as well. 
The art work in this pretty good, and the use of CGI is integrated well.  The mechs and battles as a whole always look top notch. 
although the story is based on the idea i stated above, it evolves as it goes and you get lots of back story which leads to a really nice overall plot. 
This show is always a joy to watch because of the hilarious things done by the characters that are ingeniously intertwined with an excellent story of war and the like.   
This is actually one show i recommend the dub over the sub (which is extremely rare)  because they just did such an amazing job on it. 
Amazing show, a must watch. be sure to watch the OVAish type sequel Fumoffu and the direct sequel TSR.

    Story: 9 
The story was very original in that it took the two common anime genres of mecha and high school life and slammed them together. The coupling of these two genres was very successful because it gave the light heartedness of school life with the seriousness and politics of mecha. Surprisingly the darkness and comedy made a very elegant contrast.  I really liked how the action always had a purpose rather than some anime were there is a 5 episode long battle scene that isn't really all that important in the scheme of things. 
I thought the art was very good because it had it's own style but wasn't pretentious. And for an anime released in 2002 it definitely had superior art than others in that time frame. 
Sound:7 
I'm writing this for the english dubbed version and while I really liked the voice actor that played sousuke I wasn't really impressed with kaname's voice actress every now and again her voice simply didn't sound sincere. The supporting actors all had varying degrees of success from okay to very good. The accompanying music was okay. 
Characters: 9 
I really loved all the characters in this anime. They all had their funny and heartbreaking moments and none of them were the conventional shounen characters. Rather than being the testosterone filled, save the world hero Sousuke is a serious in control person who comically fails at functioning in a society where you can't use weapons against other people. Kaname isn't the typical damsel in distress. Though she lacks formal training she always tries and even succeeds in helping herself. All the characters had faults that made them even more endearing. Frankly I have trouble describing the characters in the correct light but rest assured they are the type you become quickly attached to. 
Enjoyment: 10 
Nothing in this anime is perfect but something about  it stands out and just makes it plain enjoyable and fun. It's the type of series you watch in a day because its just hard to stop watching.  
 Theres just something endearing about this anime that makes it great. The stories and the characters are fun yet thought provoking you will laugh one moment and then be deep in thought the next. I've rated anime higher than this one but never really enjoyed them as much as this one it's definitely one of my favourites

    I started watching this because I was looking for a good Mecha after the amazing Gundam Wing and gosh this show is so stupid. The men are playing the roles of bitches and bitches are playing the roles of men to a certain extent. The chicks still are still ditzy/pin-cushions (ie: the captain is blatantly obviously not captain material) and I chalked up the protagonists embarrassing lines and getting hit by chicks all the time to be him being the only stupid character, however other men also started saying womanly lines like ""I'm ready for punishment"" to chicks.... Majorly turn off. When i watch anime I place myself in the story. I couldn't do that here, the men here were so gosh darn bitches. Taking orders from chicks, getting hit by chicks left and right, and the men apologizing. 
Un-freaking-believable. I stopped watching this show at episode 12, I can't believe I made it that far. 
Going to go check out Mobile Suit Gundam 00 now, I hear amazing things about that.

    After being torn over season two of Sword Art Online I was hoping to watch something I could clearly review as either bad or good, something simple to talk about. Full Metal Panic! came up as a recommendation and I figured I’d really enjoy it, especially given how funny the first couple of episodes were. But as it progressed it got a little muddied as it was balancing two genres and couldn’t find a focus. This review is going to give my first impressions of this show as a whole but I do want the reader to know that it’s a show I want to watch again in the future now that I know that the initial impression it gives isn’t what you’re going to get. 
Sousuke Sagara works for a mercenary group known as Mithril who operate out of a giant submarine and have made it their task to save people with a certain ability. These people, called the Whispered, have minds chock full of tech terminology and can also pilot and operate equipment with a certain driver installed. 
This takes us to Kaname Chidori, a regular Japanese high school girl until Sagara shows up. She slowly learns of him and his pals being part of this military group as a bad guy comes after her hoping to unlock the secrets in her mind. 
The series starts in a very comedic way, offering us a unique situation with Sagara. He’s a military guy who cannot adapt to civilian life in the least. Becoming a high school student in order to protect Chidori, he gets into all kinds of really funny situations from bringing a gun to school to saving Chidori by holding up a guy on her balcony who just wanted to steal her panties. The high school setting and Chidori’s tsundere character are all familiar but Sagara is that outstanding character that shines as a comedic entity. So I felt that the series was going to follow through as a comedy with a small amount of military action here and there. 
Around episode four or five the class goes on a trip that leads to the plane being hijacked and Sagara having to save Chidori from the bad guys. This is where the show slows considerably. First of all the action for much of the show is weak and boils down to very shonen-esque. These sequences take far too long and the one or two episode comedy tease between these military-centered episodes are so out of place, yet the best part. Where Full Metal Panic! shines is the unique comedy. The dynamics of Chidori and Sagara work well to set up a romance, the situation works well to create the funny. But the show is so indecisive on what it wants to be that these glimmers of genius are shadowed by the mediocrity. 
The bad guy Gauron is…well, a bad guy. He wants the Whispered because…well, they’re there. The reasoning behind Gauron being there is pretty shaky. We’re given a small glimpse of why he wants the girls but he’s otherwise there to be the antagonist. It’s one of the biggest problems with the show and especially considering FMP focuses more on the action than the comedy. If I were to be invested in the action, I’d want to be invested in seeing the bad guy get his come-uppance, right? But with Gauron, I could care less. 
There are four big action arcs in this show, one of which is boring as hell, two of which are eh, and the other is kind of neat. The first two arcs of the show are the eh ones. Much like the bad guy, they’re just there. The third arc, which takes Sagara to his home country, is the weakest one. I was so bored I actually fast forwarded through it. The final action arc is overlong but has some unique action. 
Did I mention the giant robots? This is one of those shows where I feel like the robots don’t need to exist. Don’t get me wrong, giant robots are always tactically stupid and make little sense in a real world situation, but watching these robots pull puny knives as weapons and start having CQC fights was pretty hilarious. 
Let’s add to those complaints with a few more concerning the characters. Sagara as a lead is hilariously clueless and entertaining in the school setting. In the military setting he’s rather boring; just another cold, calculating military kid like Lelouche from Code Geass. And the accompanying characters are truthfully no better. 
Chidori is a tsundere. Pretty cut and paste overall. In situations where she’s opposite Sagara, she can be cute and funny but on her own she’s hopelessly two-dimensional. As I keep saying, if this were a romantic-comedy these two would be perfectly acceptable characters and fun to watch play off each other. But on their own they’re pretty dull. 
Tessa is worth a mention. She’s the sixteen year old captain of the submarine Mithril operates out of. She’s well-respected by the crew who also seems to see her as fap bait as much as the writers did. A strong female lead she isn’t. An adorable moeblob who acts strong only when the situation calls for it then cries into the arms of Sagara (who she loves, opening a pointless love triangle) when things get tough, she is. Tessa is a girl I only wish had been given a lot better treatment because there are moments toward the end where she seems a genuine badass. 
Other characters include a womanizing sniper and a female sergeant whose character I can barely discern aside from “drunkard”. 
Also, how can a show have some of the best animation I’ve seen in early-2000 anime yet some of the most mediocre at the same time? 
Full Metal Panic! is all over the place and suffers from not having a singular direction. If it had focused on the comedy or the military action instead of jumping back and forth it would have worked. But as it is, it’s a very average piece with a lot of potential. I can only hope that later seasons nail the balancing of elements to leave me with a more satisfying experience.

    This is one of the first anime I’ve seen when I was younger on television dubbed by our language. I am watching this again with its original version. 
I am not very fond of Mecha series but this one changed my view with this type of genre completely. Of course, when we’re talking about Mechas, it’s always about war which is very interesting and we all know that it is always a sure hit. Though, there is lightness in the storyline, the main plot is very serious and equipped with heavy drama. However, it is not overly done to the point of being far-fetched. Every element is well-balanced; from the drama to the comedy part to the romance part, everything is well-incorporated with one another so the result is such an interesting and nice story.  
Even for a typical 24 episodes series, there are a wide range of interesting characters in the story. From civilian to the military; there are quite few that would really make an impression. Kaname is the very cliché “TSUNDERE” heroine that would always get angry at the male protagonist because she won’t admit her real feelings towards him. Well, usually the typical dense guy is always partnered with a tsundere girl because it is no doubt very effective. Though, sometimes she can be really irritating. She always gets mad at Sousuke when the truth is, she just wants him to notice her. And in important times, she would play “hard to get” act or even deny what she feels for Sousuke which extremely irritates me. With that said, she is still pretty much likeable character. Plus, her character is somewhat interesting because of her mysterious abilities. And her relationship with Sagara is still very sweet and cute. 
About SAGARA SOUSUKE 
I think Sousuke is one of the rarest and most original male protagonists out there. All he thinks about and knows are things about the military and ironically it is mostly the source for the comical acts in the series. He becomes extremely cute and funny because of his stiffness and seriousness in almost all things. However, this personality and his amazing skills are the reason why he’s very much effective in the military field, though it is also the reason why he’s having a hard time dealing with people outside the military. And after meeting Kaname, little by little he learns different things that are quite new to him particularly when it comes to emotions. 
Considering it was made around early 2000’s, the animation is not that great compared to the ones of today. However, during those times it was really amazing. I still think it is made well. It is clean and not complicated or to the point of being far-fetched. The Mecha’s are also not made too complicated. Somehow, it is made realistic and believable as much as possible.

    So I decided to give FMP a proper watch after pretty much giving up on it the first time and rating it pretty low.  
On second viewing, after sitting down and watching it properly, with an open mind, I enjoyed it this time. It's certainly not the worst but no where near the best. It's a fairly entertaining show but I'd say it's certainly aimed more at the younger anime audience. At times it's just that little bit too ditzy for me & the action scenes just lack something. It's a mecha anime but the parts I enjoyed, didn't involve mecha whatsoever. The non-action, light hearted side of the story is the high point of the series.  
From this series and on the strength of the FMP fanbase, I will definately continue watching FUMOFFU & Second Raid but I'm expecting a bit more from each. This series delivered just enough to keep me interested and I have heard that the next two series get better.

    Story- Full metal panic is a multitude of things all rolled into one show. it is a school, romance, comedy, military, Sci-Fi, mech, action, drama-ish show. the only way all these genres can possible fit into one show is by it's premise. where Sagara a young soldier working for a private military is sent to protect Chidori a ""Whispered"" who are people who somehow have vast hidden knowledge inside them, and their knowledge is also the reason to have mechs and other Sci-Fi objects in their world. because of this, they are valuable targets even though it's never explained how they became whishered or how they are able to be located. the first few episodes are pretty much sagara protecting Chidori, and getting into situations because he doesn't know how to integrate/blend into civilian life. over that time they grow fond of each other. after that comes the more action-y part of the show named Gauron, as a group of people including the main antagonist of the entire series hi-jack a plane chidori and her class on in order to kidnap her and unleash her inner whispered. the situation ends with a mech battle between the Sagara and Gauron, as Sagara beats him with Lamba drive a machine powered by emotions and Chidori being able to tell the weakness of the enemy. thus the arc ends and Chidori learns that sagara is a soldier 
all following arc/storylines in the series pretty much follow the same pattern. where a situation arises usually with Gauron pulling the strings or is the antagonist of the arc and usually ends with Sagara winning via the Lamba drive or through Chidori's help. in between the arcs are pretty much the slice-of-life part of the story but never serve much of a purpose other than filler with the of the first episodes. when it comes down to how the story is structured and flows it feels rather flimsy as things are contrived for the sake convenience of the story to move somewhere rather than to stagnate in the school setting. the tone shift between the action and the comedy school life feels weak, most of the comedy isn't really funny with more misses than hits, and there wasn't much of an impact that any of the story lines left on the season as a whole. 
3/10 
characters 
the main characters of the show are Sagara a young soldier tasked with guarding Chidori, and getting into mishaps as he fails to integrate into civilian life. and Chidori the class rep in her school as well as a whispered containing special technological knowledge, as well as her having a blunt and tsundere attitude. other characters are the people from mithril namely Mao a soldier that likes drinking, kurtz a try-hard womanizer, testarossa the captain of the submarine that they are stationed on, and many other people on the sub. the main antgonist of the show is Gauron a person who just won't stay dead throughout the entire season and some lesser antagonist who are connected to him but are mostly bland and not worth noting. they don't really develope much as characters other than Chidori growing fond of each other and meeting the people from mithril. oh, and chidori also has a friend with glasses if that's worth noting. 
4/10 
art/animation- the art and animation for the show are ok-ish. i'm not really fond of the character designs in the show. it's decent for it's time, but feels bland now a days. there is a lot of use of CGI when it comes to machinery mostly for the subs and the helicopters that when shown look very off putting. the mech fights are decent enough, but nothing amazing; same can be said for the regular people fights. a lot of the violence is omitted for a show that has military and mechs where it doesn't feel like there is a lot of impact in the fights. 
6/10 
sound- the voice acting is par for the course good. Chidori's voice does sound a better annoying at first but after a little while sounds pretty good. the soundtrack is ok with a lot of military like themes for the acion parts and generic music for the school life part, with the military soundtrack being the most memorable of the two. 
6.5/10 
enjoyment- mostly bored abd hoping the next two season are going to be better than this. 
overall- the story is a bit bad , the characters are mediocre and underdeveloped,  the animation and sound are ok. 
4/10﻿

    Full Metal Panic is a light novel series written by Shoji Gatoh and illustrated by Shiki Douji, and it was adapted into a 24 episode anime that was produced by studio Gonzo, and aired on TV in Japan from Jan 8 2002 to Jun 18 2002. The anime series was directed by Kouichi Chigira who's also directed shows like the Last Exile TV series. 
The story of Full Metal Panic follows Sousuke Sagara. Spusuke is a 17 year old sargeant within the paramilitary counter-terrorist force, Mithril. One day he and his team recieves a special mission, to enroll in a Japanese high school in order to protect a girl named Kaname Chidori. She is believed to be what is referred to as a ""whispered"", and there are terrorists who are looking to kidnap her and use her. However, trying to protext Chidori without her knowing proves to be a lot harder than anticipated for Sousuke who has been raised on the battlefield and knows very little about how to act ""normal"". 
This show has a huge cast of diverse characters, and we're not simply locked into the perspective of one character. Sousuke Sagara is one of the shows main characters. He's a 17 year old boy who since he was an 8 year old kid has known nothing but the battlefield. Now he's a part of Mithril, an organization dedicated to trying to stop terrorists. 
Chidori Kaname is another of the main characters, and is at first what seems like your average popular high school girl. But there turns out to be more to her. She is also what is referred to as a Whispered, people with a lot of knowledge and the ability to create powerful devices and machinery. However, Chidori herself is not aware that she possesses this power and knowledge. 
You also have the rest of Sousuke's team who joins him for this mission. First you have Kurz Weber who is a flirt and doesn't seem like he is serious about anything, but he is actually a very talented sniper. You also have Melissa Mao. She is SRT's (Special Response Team) second in command. 
Lastly you have Teletha Testarossa also referred to as just Tessa. She is the captaion of captain of Mithril's TDD-1 submarine, despite only being 16 years of age, due to her being a genius. 
Visually this show is fine. The character designs are pretty standard early 2002s designs and the backgrounds are fine. The animation in this show has it's high's and lows, but the longer the shows goes on, the more of a drop in animation quality we start to see. It's not like it's a poorly animated show or that it looks bad, but it is not consistent. 
The music in this show was done by Toshihiko Sahashi who has also been responsible for the music to shows like Gunslinger Girl and the original Hunter x Hunter. Sadly the music in this show doesn't really stand out at all. It's not bad, but it is simply there. It works in the context of a scene, but you're probably not gonna come away from this show thinking a whole lot about the music. 
The first thing that I'm sure people are gonna react to with this show is that it sounds like a lot of other early 2000s anime. I mean, how many times haven't we seen the trope filled high school anime? If you've been watching anime for a while, probably a few more times than you would have wished for. And this show is also guilty of being very much a product of it's time. A lot of the tropes that we have gotten used to are also to be found in here. However, what seperates this show from a lot of other shows is how it uses these tropes to it's advantage. You might think that this is a show about a weird guy trying to protect a girl and ends up enrolling in high school and hilarity ensues, and while you are not wrong, that's only one small portion of the show. You have also got the actual plot of the anime which is about a world of relative unrest, and where the slightest spark can set of a huge war. Also, the characters might seem very simple at first, but most of these characters are more than just their respective tropes, and get fleshed out more over the course of the story. In other words, this show is not trying to seperate itself from others by doing something completely different to what other shows at the tie were doing, but rather by doing a lot of the same things better than most other shows would, and it does succeed... at least to an extent. I would be lying if I said that there aren't times where the tropes pull the show down. Things like pointless bath scenes, and certain episodes that adds absolutely nothing to the story are also present in this show. But despite this, most of the episodes are still good and add something to the story, so rather the pointless episodes being a big part of the show, there are only a few of them. 
So my overall thoughts on this show is that it's a good show. Sure, it has it's ups and downs, but for the most part it's a fairly solid show. I would not recommend this show to anyone though. If you are very tired of early 2000s tropes, then I'd suggest to stay away from this, at least for now, but if you are not that bothered by them, then go ahead and give this show a chance. It's an entertaining watch. Full Metal Panic has also got a sequel, and I will definitely be checking that out at a later date.

    Full Metal Panic was at first not on my list of things to watch when I saw its Newtype Magazine spread a while back. For the longest time I had not been very keen to watch another damn mecha anime. It seemed from 2004-2008 that is all we had to watch was mecha or hair-brained shoujo. However, wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt I had rented my first copy of it and popped it in on a snow day from school. 
Surprise, surprise I found out that I actually like FMP even if it was mecha. The strategic blend of comedy, drama, and action worked so well I was impressed. To me the situations and characters did not feel forced or out of place; everyone worked smoothly. Characters make up a good portion of the anime we watch and it is always good to know we have a solid cast to view. Full Metal Panic takes our rather common sense lacking main character Sosuke and places him in the funniest situations. His lack of knowledge on civilian life is what makes up about 87% of the show's comedy. 
Even with that being said when it comes down to action and drama the show delivers, and boy does it. Right in the beginning of the series we are introduced to one of (my personal favorite) villains, Gauron. He is a no hold back, slimy, double crossing creep but he is such a good villain for Sosuke to play off of. While both thrust into similar situations their thinking could not be more opposite. It is that opposition that truly made them one of my personal favorite hero vs villain duo.  
Animation for this series is very lively and well done as is again done by Gonzo Digimation. The opening theme Tomorrow by Mikuni Shimokawa is uplifting and nostalgic, and the ending theme is peaceful and melodious.  
All in all a great series if you want good characters, a solid war story without the boring bits, and lots of good action.

    Fullmetal Panic is an anime/light novel series that tries to combine typical highschool drama and mech fighting action. However, what comes out of this attempt is a decent anime that, while perhaps revolutionary during its time, has not aged gracefully. 
The story of Full Metal Panic, as stated earlier, tries to combine both Drama at highschool and intense military and mecha action. However, what causes its down fall is not falling at one side or the other but the mediocrity of both aspects. The entire set up of the situation, the heroine's 'Whispered' candidate status, serves as an excuse for this story. While there are a few moments of comedy gold and intense showdowns, the series as a whole does not do anything particularly well. The actions scenes are okay, the dialogue between classmates is basically filler and overall, it lacks focus. The ending, while nice, is preceded by one of the weirdest final boss fights I've ever scene, making me do a double take before saying good bye to this series. 
STORY 7/10 
The art shows its age with no real CGI to speak of. The style also seems a tad generic. The designs themselves are not bad (well, at least not the characters. The mechs are a different story) its just how they are drawn. They show emotions and are quite dynamic, but a certain stiffness to the animation can be felt.  
ART 7/10 
The catchy opening was a welcome addition to the OST, but everything else did not seem up to snuff. The voice acting was quite well done, with characters capturing their roles perfectly.  
SOUND 8/10 
The characters of this series had the potential to be something great, but most of them get little development. Sousuke, the hero, is a mercenary with a blood stained past. He reminds me of Setsuna of Gundam 00, except he is much more likable due to his going to extreme lengths to protect Chidori. He provides nice comic relief, more so than his one trick pony pal Kurz, who is the typical girl-chasing best friend. Testarossa, the commander of their group, may seem like a naive girl at times, but her sincere nature and deep thinking make her one of the more well rounded of the characters. There's also Mao, another of Sousuke's friends, but she does not see as much spot light as the other females.  
As far as Chidori goes, she is a defining feature of this series. She represents the end product of the show: a highschool drama with mecha elements. Her involvement in the military side of the plot feels shoehorned in, especially during the instances where she becomes a damsel in distress. She herself is a typical tsundere-esque girl. On numerous occasions, she tries to show depth, only to fall flat. She holds an important military secret, but her 'secret' is about as original as Obama's Fried Chicken in China. Overall, like the anime itself, she's full of pointless drama and while she's initially appealing, not a lot of thought went into crafting a unique experience.  
There's also the main villan, Gauron, and I'll just say this: Ali-Al-Saachez takes a lot of cues from this guy. 
CHARACTERS: 7/10 
While I was watching FMP, I did enjoy it. It was a nice romp, but looking back, I just can't help but think of its flaws. Its cliche devices and the characters of Chidori and Kurz really brought it down. Sadly, the rest of the cast, while good, were not enough to carry the aging animations and lukewarm soundtrack. 
ENJOYMENT: 7/10 
Its a shame that FMP did not live up to the hype around it in my anime community. I must say though that while it mirrors the more recent Gundam 00, it does what 00 did, but with a lot more consistency.  
OVERALL: 7/10

    Let's start on what took my attention in the presentation, the animation in superb, character designs are gorgeous and music is very catchy. Like all Gonzo made anime, the visuals are very outstanding but what lack is the story because there are holes left in the story and unless there will be a sequel I can forgive them (well there is a sequel so its understandable). As a mecha show like Gundam this has less action but has comedy to make up for it. In the funny scenes you will always find Souske trying to protect Chidori by all means possible its really hilarious its really hard not to laugh. In the action scenes, it is well animated and you'll find it top notch.  
The characters in this series has excellent chemistry they really suit each other and that fact makes the plot holes forgivable. The love team of Souske and Chidori are one of my favorites in anime. Their relationship to one another is like on and off but that what makes their relationship interesting.  
The opening song Tomorrow and the ending song Kirenai Hana by Mikuni Shimokawa is very catchy and it suits the series very well. The bgm is also nice because they fit in every scene they were put especially in the ones use during fighting scenes.  
Really, there are some unanswered questions left and that left me unsatisfied. The questions like what are the purpose of Whispers? How does the black technology work? Is Gauron really dead? etc. There are so many questions that I can't write them here. 
By the way, this anime is base from a light novel written by Gatoh Shoji. The studio that brought this to life is Gonzo(Vandread, Gate Keepers, Chrono Crusade) and is directed by Koichi Chigira.  
Thank goodness this has a sequel and that will fill the Souske and Chidori emptiness in me. Well this anime sure isn't perfect but that's forgiven because I like the characters and visuals so I give this show a 4/5 stars not bad for a Gonzo anime.

    If I were to compare it to anything, I'd say Full Metal Panic is as close you can get to a Tom Clancy novel in anime form. Granted it has the staple mecha and highschool staples of anime, but the plot focuses on protagonist Sasuke; soldier, mecha pilot, and his dealings in international conflicts while protecting Kaname and pretending to be a high school student. Sasuke's character is fantastic because he is a born soldier, which basically spawns most of the action throughout the show, but he is so wooden and stoic even compared to his squad mates and has no idea how to deal with his high school experience due to his constant military focused mind. The subplot of Sasuke and Kaname's love hate relationship is some of the funniest stuff I've seen in anime, and it's a nice balance with the action based plot (and they sometimes cross). The majority of the first season's plot  happens during Sasuke's military ventures, and overall I gotta say this is a really well balanced show with memorable characters and plot.Full Metal Panic is good, and when it picks up it's a lot of fun to watch being a high school AND mech show at the same time. The main gripe I have with the show is how forced the ""Sasuke has to control the Arbalest because cryptic character development"" is and it just seems out of place.

    There is no main story arc. The main villain almost always facing off against sagara but for reasons unknown. We never know what are the villians intentions to the very end of the show. His intentions are inconsistent such as with his infiltration of the submarine. He first said he will kidnap Chidori because she is made out to be a person with special abilities but in when he gains control of the ship he just tries to kill himself?  
Characters are also inconsistent. The greatest example could be made with the supporting character Weber. He is made out to be the comic relief of the cast but goes out of character during the final last few episodes. His personality is depicted as being a perv but instantly changes to being a white knight for Chidori when Sagara makes her cry.  
There is no characterization or growth of the main character. Sagara who is a socially inept military nut stays that way through out the entire show. There is no growth to try and connect with others. The only instance we can see any actual growth is when he invites Chidori to the island but is only given the last three minutes of the last episodes to show that Sagara is trying to connect with her. Due to this moment only being given a few minutes we cant tell if is intentions are genuine or if he is just doing it to get Chidori to trust him again which would make his job of protecting her much easier. 
Character conflict and how it is handled is laughable. There are two main conflicts that the main characters face. In the first instance, Chidori says that she hates Sagara but is resolved by her visiting him and saying sorry which concludes the conflict instantly. The second conflict is when Sagara tells Chidori that she doesnt know him at all. This is also concluded with a sorry from Sagara.  
Thinking of what genre to put for this series is difficult. You want to put it as action but the movements are very stiff and it feels like a fight between two cardboard boxes. Putting this as a romance is inacurate as we cant even tell what the chemistry is like between Sagara and Chidori since Sagara also had a heated moment with Testarossa or if he is even ok with having a relationship with someone since in the first few episodes he says that having a relationship would cloud judgement. The comedy aspec is there but is only provided by Chidori and Weber. Chidori provides it by giving Sagara a hard time about is social ineptitiy which confuses the audience about when she is actaully angry with Sagara if she is like that 24/7. 
In the end there is no lesson that the main character learns. He doesnt become anymore socially capable, he doesnt start anything with Chidori, he doesnt become a different person from the affects of the story, he just remains a static character. This would be fine if the actual plot was good but it just feels like playing a side quest. There really is no main goal or challenge for Sagara to overcome plot-wise.

    Full Metal Panic is a lot of fun! It features an outstanding sense of humor and great set of characters. Sousuke Sagara is hands down one of the funniest and fascinating anime characters ever conceived and Kaname Chidori; while she may appear to be an angry tsundere most of the time, she feels like a real person and is also very funny in her own right. These two combined is comedic﻿ genius and the situations and interactions presented here are downright hilarious!  
Then there is the other side of the spectrum: The military stuff... Looking back on it, i really didn't care﻿ about most of it. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed all the sitcom aspects a lot more than the Mecha-stuff which i'll probably just skip on rewatch. It's just not that interesting, outside of the Mao/Kurtz banter and for the fact that we get to know about what drives Sousuke which IS interesting. The creators just wanted to have their cake and eat it too, but only really succeeded with one. 
...And despite how completely unrealistic her being a 16-yo submarine captain is (let that sink in) I like Tessa Testarossa: She's cute﻿ and the resulting love triangle makes for some fun moments (see Episode 13) but c'mon - We all know she's just a wacky obstacle in the Chidori/Sagara relationship! We want those crazy kids to get together dammit - The fans demand it!  
All in all I award this first season a 7.5/10: The military stuff is decent, if a bit dull, but what makes this series great and so much fun is the characters and their witty interactions!  
*I highly recommend watching the English dub sorely because of Chris Patton's hilariously methodical portrayal of Sousuke and his chemistry with Luci Christian as Kaname. In fact all the English VA's do an outstanding job - Check it out!

    The first time I watched FMP, I only watched till the second episode. It was really a stunner then. I got my hands on a really high quality video FMP and it was really eye candy for me. Loved the first two episodes as well. Laughed my head off real bad. I think it's equivalent to any good comedy (considering FMP is not really comedy). 
Well I just finished the series recently and I thought I'd do a write-up on FMP. I think overall it's a pretty good series. The whole package wasn't half as good as the beginning 2 episodes though.  
Story 7. The story's military-related. I could relate really well with it since I'm in the army currently. The story was pretty well drawn out but not very exceptional in my opinion. There's a good mix of suggestive romance, war (not exactly war but it's a war setting), school-life, comedy, mecha?. 
Art 9. The artwork is pretty unique, not overly cute (thumbs up for me), and the characters look mature. The colours used are very bright and vibrant, it'd be really nice if you had a really high quality version of FMP e.g. the dvd, and play it on a CRT or good LCD panel.  
Sound 7. Honestly I can't really remember the OST of FMP. But I guess if I didn't notice it too well, it's not that impressive. I remembered it was pretty nice though. The opening and ending were quite nice. 
Character 8. I liked most of the characters in FMP. Quite likable. And it's rare that I'd come to like the protagonist. I didn't really like the main girl's attitude that much. FMP has a full array of characters and it was built well. Most characters have ranks so it's quite interesting (if you know about these things). The main characters are too powerful though lol. 
Enjoyment 7. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought. It's bad to bring expectations when you're watching anime imo. Unless it's really that good. If only the standard of the first few episodes dragged on till the end, it may just end up as one of my favourites. 
Overall 7. I'd give like a 7.8 if they allowed decimal points. 7 is a bit unfair for FMP I find. It's a quality production, just whether you like it or not.

    I enjoyed Full Metal Panic alot! 
It was one of the first animes that really captured and stayed with me as a favourite. The characters are very likable and the development was great, although im not a huge mecha/ war fan,this anime actually made me like the genre more! 
The anime is very funny but also has another more serious and action side, which blend well together. I have been searching but I havent been able to find an anime with the atmosphere and enjoyment that i experienced when watching this anime! 
The downside of the anime may have to be that it ends! 
Overall, I have to give 10/10 as it is a story and an anime that i will always love and remember.

    Full Metal Panic! is a show mostly discovered by people putting a space between the ""Full"" and ""metal"" of Fullmetal Alchemist.  Despite the similiar titles, the shows are completely different in their presentation and plot- Fullmetal alchemist being, well, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Full Metal Panic! being a rather goofy mecha about a bunch of highschoolers.  That being said, it's not bad, just... slightly dissapointing. 
Art- 6 
Not a fan.  Didn't hate it but I really wish that the lines weren't so pronounced.  It makes the characters look way older than they are!  The AS designs didn't impress me, but since they are consistent with the manga (which you should red b/c it's awesome (especially Sigma)), can't hate too much.  Gave it a 6 because I like the way the TDD looks.   
Sound-  6 
Don't like the OP but the amazing battle theme offsets it.  Rest of the OST is fairly solid, also. 
Character- 8 
  Kaname Chidori, our heroine, is misinterpreted vastly different from the manga.  Sure, she's still a tsundere, but in the manga she is determined to fight along Sousuke and save herself.  In the anime she comes off as a more typical lead, but at least I can hardly say she's annoying.  But oh boy is Sousuke the best goddamn ""hard-ass military man"" lead I've ever seen.  Maybe it was his voice actor, maybe it was his actions, maybe it was  that quirky animation-  but he is fucking hilarious.  You want more of his antics?  Entire series full of them. 
 MAJOR SPOILERS FOR MANGA INCLUDING FMP SIGMA 
You're reading this anyway you sick bastard. 
Sousuke has the most badass backstory ever.  He was the solitary survivor of a plane crash and was picked up by a Soviet sub commander.  A few years/months later (doesn't really give time frame), he it recruited by the motherfucking KGB to be an assassin.  But that's not all.  He then goes to Afghanistan to assassinate a rebel leader but instead defects to their cause and fights as a guerilla soldier for 7 years.  Afterwards he joins an elite group of mercenaries and becomes the pilot of the most advanced mech in the world.  All by the age of 17. 
Enjoyment- 7 
A thing you need to watch because the FMP! Sigma manga is glorious work.  Worth the time but definently not a masterpiece. 
Overall- 7 
Give it a watch, you probably won't be too disappointed. After which you should go read the manga, because did I mention it's brilliant? 
R.I.P. to your feels if you do read the manga.

    The entire Full Metal Panic! series is simply amazing.    What make the series great is the characters and their interaction.  The Series includes everything, Romance, comedy, action, etc.  I've watched the series multiple times and loved it every time.  It's a good laugh yet thrilling at the same time.  I highly recommend it.

    Originally watched this show because I heard Full Metal Panic: Second Raid! was very good, and I wanted some fully fleshed out characters. I don't regret watching it, but it's very much a mediocre show.  
[b]Story[/b]  
The story framework follows seventeen year old, Sousuke Sagara, and ""Whispered"" candidate Kaname Chidori. ""Whispered"" candidacy is essentially a MacGuffin-- an excuse for Sousuke and Kaname to hang out, while later it'll be used to explain/elaborate on the ""deus ex machina"" of the series: the lambda driver. For some reason (it's never really explained), only certain people can use the lambda driver. Sousuke is one of them. The main villain is the other.  
I'm not really sure what else to say here. There really isn't much of a cohesive plot. It seems that random missions, or ""fate"", just happen to bring Sousuke, Chidori, and the villain together. At first, the Villian is after Chidori. Then he's just smuggling cargo. Then he has some sort of suicidal, ""let the world burn"" motivation. It's hard to really understand the underlying conflict in this series. He also only appears within three main parts of the series, while the rest is essentially filler, or poor exposition.  
My main critique of this show is that we never fully understand anyone's motivations, or how anything works. Who does the villain work for throughout the series? Are they different people/groups? Where is he getting all his influence/money? What's his motivation? What's his relationship with Sousuke (this is supposed to be a key factor between their struggle).  
Who is Sousuke? We learn a little of his past, but not much. We get that he's very dutiful and stiff, but why? His struggle is almost more clear at the beginning of the series than the end. 
Why do Chidori/Tessa like Sousuke? Can it all really be summed up to, ""There's just something about him""?  
Who is Kalinin? What's his relationship with Sousuke? They never flesh this relationship out.   
These relationships are written as if they drive the plot, but they are never fleshed out, and we never fully understand them. It's all very flat.  
5/10 
[b]Art[/b] 
The art's fairly good. It's a bit inconsistent. Sometimes an action scene/character interaction is extremely fluid and dazzling. At other times, it's blurry, vague and simple. Overall, it's OK.  
7/10 
[B]Sound[/b] 
I actually like the music of the series. Nothing amazing, but the light themes were light and quirky, and the action music was thrilling but not distracting.  
8/10 
 [b] Character [/b] 
As I said before, the characters are written as if they're the ones driving the plot, but we never really get to know any of them. Chidori is just the popular girl at school. Sousuke is just a life-long, dutiful soldier. Kalinin is the father figure. Mao is a spunky female soldier. Weber is a laid-back foil to Sousuke. And other than his relation to Sousuke, we never learn anything about Zaied, who was supposed to have such a profound influence on our main protagonist.  
The only character I really liked was Tessa, the captain of the submarine that Sousuke is stationed on. She's a soldier, so she is just as dutiful as Sousuke. She's also quite talented, for semi-secret reasons. But there are many episodes that brush over her worries, sense of humor, jealousy and compassion. If only all the other characters were as well layered as she is. 
[B] Enjoyment [/b] 
The characters are pretty much flat tropes, but they're still fun. For the most part, the filler episodes are silly, and the humor is actually pretty good. There's lots of fan-service, but I enjoyed it's tongue-in-cheek nature (mostly). It almost seemed as if the filler episodes were really at the heart of the show instead of the main conflict, which felt like an excuse to keep airing. 
[b] Overall [/b] 
All in all, the characters are flat but enjoyable. No deep, rich themes. No complex, interesting characters or relationships. But the humor is good and the story/characters are simple. If you want to something easy to digest, this anime would be the perfect amount of simple, yet suspenseful.

    REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS 
Full Metal Panic is a very bad mecha anime. That's it. 
The story is really weak and sometimes you know what is exactly gonna happen. The characters are predictable.... the only thing good here is the relationship of Sousuke and the School (that is REALLY funny and non-sense). 
But if you expect a great story or a beautiful romance you will not find this here. 
I will recommend you this anime IF you really like bad developing romances or if you are looking for bad mechas. 
Even though, MAYBE i see the second season cause I liked Sousuke character.

    WARNING BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS THE OPINION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL. WHETHER GOOD OR BAD YOU SHOULD NOT LET IT DETERMINE YOUR FEELINGS OF THE ANIME. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE ON THIS SITE I WILL NOT WRITE A GOOD REVIEW JUST BECAUSE IT IS ANIME. THE ANIME HAS TO BE GOOD IN MY OPINION. 
Full Metal Panic! With this weak, cliche story line... you should panic. Full Metal Panic is an anime that came out in 2002 as a military, school life comedy. It is rated PG-13 for some references to sexual content, a little adult language, and violent scenes. 
For starters, I watched this as a dub. I am the type of person who will watch the anime as a dub first if it's available. If the dub is not good I will stop watching the dub and continue in sub. The fact I did not stop watching in dub is because the dub voice acting was actually good. The female lead voice Chidori Kaname was voiced by Luci Christian and like all of her works she made the emotions of the character shine. The male lead voice Sousuke Sagara was voiced by Chris Patton and his serious, professional voice is what saves the anime from being a totally flop. 
The story line for the anime follows soldier Sousuke Sagara as he and two others are assigned the task of guarding another ""Whispered"" Chidori Kaname. In the anime the whisper knows stuff that enemy armies want so they are in danger. I felt the plot was played out and not original. I have watched so many animes about a guy guarding a girl with mystical powers that quite frankly it is getting old. You must keep in mind that this is a trend of anime, so it's not a big surprise. It's successful usually, so it's okay. To make the plot even more unoriginal is how they try to throw comedy in the mix. They make Sagara a military nut that does outrageous things in Kaname's school. It acts as a double sword making the anime unique, but at the same time corny. 
The characters are not original either. The male lead is another serious type, the only thing that is original about it is that he is too serious. The female lead comes off as a dismal in distress, but is another loud, abusive female lead. Other characters include Weber, Kurz (Vic Mignogna) classic perverted male, Testarossa, Teletha(Hilary Haag) classic quiet person who creates the love triangle for Sagara. 
Nothing pops about the art style. It makes you feel as if the mangaka was playing it safe by not being different. Overall this anime can be amusing if you are a person who likes school comedy and military antics. If you are looking for something original this is not the anime for you. If you are looking for something that will keep you being bored, anime for you. This anime keeps you tuned in, but in the end feeling empty instead of begging for more.

    Lots of Spoilers.... 
Dear Sousuke-kun,  
When you want to protect a girl – er, lady – it’s not in good taste to feel her up. That’s all. 
Respectfully, etc. 
Full Metal Panic the anime is good screwball comedy. Never mind that the light novel writer went off into dark, apocalyptic drivel essentially lobotomizing the lovely Tessa and demonizing Kalinin. No, no. This is Full Metal Panic the anime, and Sousuke at 17 and in high school for the first time in his abnormal life is the perfect straight man.  
There are three major story lines, each drawing in a wider array of characters and scenarios. In the first, Sousuke and Kaname do the two-step, finding a natural rhythm to the tune of an Arm Slave loaded with a lambda driver; the lyrics? “If you lose, they’ll rip off my clothes, play around with my body and kill me! You’d hate that, right?” Right, Kaname; Sousuke wins. In the second, Sousuke’s superior officer, Tessa, crashes on the duo with a homicidal teenage terrorist in tow to form a loopy square dance. And in the third, it’s an underwater dance party, with Tessa and Kaname resonating with each other to defeat the villain.  
What makes this funny are the characters. No matter how much the writers try to bury him under the “orphan child of war” angst, Sousuke is a comedic dream, an animated Buster Keaton – his beautiful face is so deadpan that you start to attribute meaning in the slightest change of his eyes. Kaname is versatile, tough, and gifted with comic timing; with her insane homerun swing and physical agility, she’s the only one who can match Sousuke stride for stride. And Tessa: can a tactical genius be this klutzy and ingenuous? “At the age of 6, I derived Einstein’s 10 component symmetric tensor field equations….My brother derived it at 4, and I’ve always felt inferior to him (smile).” On the Geiger counter of sweetness, hers is an order of magnitude higher than the rest. 
The episode to showcase the romp that is FMP is #13, “A cat and a kitten’s rock and roll.” Oh the glee of Mao.  
Three obligatory remarks: 
First, the animation. The action sequences are probably CGI, while the remainder is drawn with strong, clean outlines and sharp color. The lead characters are prettified, making them look like children playing in a grittier world.  
Second, the music. Pleasant and light, for the most part it is unobtrusive, except for the instrumental used for highlights from previous episodes which sounds like “the flight of the bumblebees” with its crescendoing fugue of strings.  
Third, the voice characterizations. The English dubs were better than the Japanese originals.  
Grade: solid B

    I really enjoyed the start of this series, but as I got further into it the shine wore off. I thought they tried to incorporate too many elements (mecha/military, magical girl, high school comedy) and didn't pull any of them off especially well. Things were brought up early in the series only to be completely forgotten about until near the end. I also thought that the series could have been half as long and would have benefitted from the faster pacing.

    With a name like FULL METAL PANIC, I wasn't expecting anything but fan service shit 
surprisingly 
the story is very cool and very likable,  
it has a pleasant mixture of fan service and serious plot,  the serious plot compares to a game of chess, with both sides more or less evenly matched, and the winner gets the strategic ""prize"", unique bimbo characters born with a special understanding of the higher functioning of any machine.  
The characters were a disappointment for me, the easiest way to describe the main character is assbergers, and with every assbergers character in anime there is a ""model potential"" girl character who caters hand and foot to the assberger laden main character to try and get his attention. Other characters follow the cookie cuter code of anime, the seductor pretty boy that fails at everything except comic relief for the viewer and the older ""lady"" that secretly cares about all of her crew mates even though she's a cunt and finally the emotionally unready to command ""prize piece"" higher functioning 16 year old.  
The best character is the bad guy, he is a dick, he will kill lie cheat steal and stab you in the back to get what he wants and he will have fun at the same time.  
The art was able to demonstrate the awesomeness of the tide shifting battle abilities that the rare mech's had. The underwater fight scenes are also very detailed and cool. 
There are times when the setting just goes out into left field, yet because I did enjoy the story so much , I will simply assume that it is because I am not a high ranking military official that I don't know of the secret american chemical warfare base 10 miles off the coast of Japan.  
In Conclusion, Full Metal Panic was good, I would happily recommend it to anyone because even though it lacked depth it was a very enjoyable anime over all.

    Okay this is my first review so be fair. 
The story is about Sagara Souske a 17 years old mercenary solider for the international peace keepers Mithril. One day he gets an assignemt to protect Kaname Chidori a High Scool student from Tokyo. Sagara takes his job wery seriosly, this leads to many funny episodes and in the begining he denies to Chidori that he actualy protects her. 
Kaname Chidori is one of the Whispers special people that have black technology in the dephts of their minds. This tecnology is years advance of the world. Therefore the criminal and old fiend of Souake shows up and tries to kidnap her. 
The weapons used in the series is just like the real world, exept that they also uses AS, giant robots that is piloted from within.  
The story is wery original and leaves an interesting plot. It doesn't take to long to come to the point, is easy to understand, yet not predictable. 
The art is in a pretty usual style. The picture doesn't stand to much still as other series do wrong. 
I don't quit know what to say about the sound as i generally don't really care about that aspect. 
The characters is quite interesting, expesially Sagara Souske who has lived as a merenary his whole life, so he has great trouble fiting in normal teenagers life. 
The characters are waried but not too original. 
This is a wery funny serie, that also contains love and fighting in a perfect balance. 
Feel free to give comment on the review.

    Having been a mecha/military anime fan for as long as I can remember, Full Metal Panic (hereby referred to as FMP) was a treat for me. It was the combination of serious military/political action and amusing comedy/romance. That being said, it becomes evident that FMP is a hotchpotch of genres, breaking free from the traditional single-minded seriousness that's often the standard of military themed anime (not that I'd know what traditional would be) 
Set in what slightly resembles today's world, FMP tells the story of Sgt./Specialist Sousuke Sagara and the exploits of the pseudo-UNish organization of peace, MITHRIL. (it would make a killer acronym.. actually, it probably is) That's the gist of the plot, which flows smoothly, creating an alternate universe that's believable. In fact, it's so believable that you can't help but get pulled into it.  
Being the sort of person that appreciates a healthy twist in the plot every once in a while, FMP offers quite a lot of unexpected moments of suspense scattered throughout the fog of your typical action scenes. 
The best part of FMP for me, which many people tend to overlook, is the sheer amount of realism applied throughout the plot. Being a military otaku myself, it was kinda self-gratifying to see accurate depictions of AEGIS class missile cruisers, Los Angeles class submarines and.. well... Sousuke's guns. 
First thing I thought after watching was &quot;their noses are too pointy.&quot; Then, &quot;Wow, that C-17 Globemaster III looks so cool o_O&quot; ... Yeah, that's about it. 
It seemed adequate, but didn't impress much. ... Really, what else do you want me to say? 
The characters are vibrant, varied, and very likable. Sousuke's otakuness and social ineptitude are the catalysts for most of the comical scenes in FMP, while Kaname's aggressiveness (tsundere, anyone?) and her chronic Sousuke-beating sessions exacerbate said catalyzed circumstances. But does this dynamic ever change? Not really. The one weak point I see is the inadequate amount of character growth. There are some changes the viewers see with respect to Sousuke's emotional capacity, but largely, the characters remain relatively identical to when the series started. In fact, it's The Second Raid that manages to build upon this more effectively than the first season. So when the series winds down to a close, Sousuke will still be incapable of giving a girl a proper gift, and Kaname will keep beating him up. But that's why we keep watching. 
10/10 guaranteed. The comedy was brilliant, with plenty of Sousuke-driven faux pas to laugh at. In terms of the serious parts, they leave you breathless for more... in a strange asphyxiating kind of way...

    Do you like mechas and military stories fashoned with comedy and fan service? This Anime is for you. 
The story is excellent. It's a superb combination of both seriousness and humor. That kind in which you may have the bloodiest battle and the funniest comments in between, but all maintaining a coherent plot. 
Characters also have impressive personalities, with many sides. 
The art isn't thaaaat great, but it's great. I've nothing to complain about. Action scenes are very enjoyable. 
The sound is very good. Music and effects suit very well scenes. Sometimes lips moved without voice and I think there are midi music, which I don't like (I don't like the fact that is not interpreted by musicians). 
I really, really enjoyed Full Metal Panic and I'm preparing for watching Fumoffu and the sequel.

    Another review brought to you once again by that drunkard Dion bloke.Warning to all that my reviews are full of mature language and some other shit. 
So FMP! what has it brought to our little world of moe and cute and huge eyes with glitter in them?Well it brought chaos and death and blood pooring from the screen and.....What?Wait a minute?Did i get this wrong?School?Romcom?What the fucking hell?What is this?Mr Jimmy and Dr Jim? 
I should point out that i'm not in any way unfit to write a review it's the anime itself that is bipolar.One min it's a romcom another min it's an all guns blazing military mecha punch in the fez. 
How's this for a story?A top secret top of the pops unit has been assigned the protection of a high school girl(my my what a surprise)who yada yada doodly has info in her head that is top secret and terrorists want them and so the 3 of the best guardians of the galaxy venture to protect the blue haired hottie.Sagara,Kurtz and Melissa are the chosen ones.They're the best,the deadliest the most fearsome team.And not only that,they can also handle the so called ""arm slaves"" mechs.So you expect at this point to hear me saying that all hell breaks loose right?Nope...They send Sagara the military nut,as we're kept reminded through the series,to fuckin school so he can be close to Chidori,his protectee.This was supposed to be funny cause Sag has no concept of real life much less school life.But take it from me this ends up just like any other ecchi harem anime you've ever seen.Everyone ""hates"" Sagman but also loves him big time..That's women for ya right there:""I want him,no i don't,maybe i do i don't know leave me alone i need time to think""...This also holds true for our little Tsundereness Chi. 
After some seriously bad attempts at comedy we stumble upon the strangest transition known to man.They thought:""We have this military nut,we have mechs...Why don't we use them?"".....And in an instant the anime becomes an Arnie Schwarzenegger-esque one.Where bullets fly like there's no tomorrow and shit explodes and blood poors from your hard drive.Or that's is exactly what they wanted you to think..The thinking behind the scenes was well thought of,the planning,the execution all that stuff was good...But the on screen result was a bit lifeless.It didn't grab me by the balls and make me stand up and sing songs of praise.I can summarize it like this..They wanted to please 2 audiences and in the process failed at both.Comedy was cheap,action was mostly an afterthought and the switch between the 2 was as unnatural and disgusting as seeing Weinstein jerking off! 
The indecisiveness between action and comedy ultimately is the main issue with FMP!.It feels like two separate shows with a weak connection between the two.Had it focused on Sousuke and Mithril and kept to being a mecha military anime,that would be fine.Or if it instead concentrated on Sousuke's inept attempts to adapt to a normal high school,that too would have been fine.But given the separated layers of mecha action and high school comedy,the result is a half great parfait. 
Animation was for the most part good.Nothing outstanding but still pleasing to the eye.The characters were nicely done as were the mecha and the military stuff like choppers and jeeps and shit.As for the movements they were jiddery at best,especially when it counted the most.In the fight scenes.There were some details that were absolutely sweet,make no mistake,but the actual scenes themselves were not quite as good as i expected.As for the use of CG,it isn't as bad as most people say they are.They are comparable or even better than modern ones.Or at least they feel like so,maybe the dark tone of the anime helped a bit there. 
Soundwise nothing stood out i'm afraid.The songs used were not fit for the tone of FMP!.In any other anime they would be fine but that was like using kids music in a porn film.VA was subpar.It could have been tons better,but like the anime itself it was medium. 
Onto the chars.Most of them are there just to fill the space.No apparent reason why the exist and when taken off screen you don't really miss them or even remember who they were.That's 70% or so of the cast rendered useless and one trick ponys.As for the main cast..Sagara is a man on a mission,an emotionless robot.Granted it is fixed later on but it wasn't anything to celebrate either cause the way it's done is stupid beyond belief.I mean this is a merc who has killed countless people from the sweet age of 8,he has witnessed the death of many loved ones.But that doesn't show in his attitude.It only shows later on in the series where some people in his team die.So we're led to believe that all of a sudden he went from I-Robot to Ms Robinson by the deaths of people he met some days ago? 
Then is her Tsudereness Chidori.who somehow falls for the robot and wants all the attention to herself.What do you mean you're off fighting terrorists who want to kill thousands of people?I want some Sagman candy and i want it now...Oh what?You are sad people died?I WANT MY ATTENTION!Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch Bitch  like someone famous said once.As for other aspects of her personality..She also switches from missshelteredtoLaraCroft in an instant.Must be the drugs she took. 
Kurtz is the womanizer of the series.That's it..Melissa as i can recall smokes more than a VW and drinks like a fish and has a hot body. 
Then there's the Cap...Tessa...This was the one character that didn't contribute almost anything trivial to the story.And she was the fuckin captain..I had to wait until the very last eps to see some signs of life or personality from this one,to see as to why she has the title of genius.She also has  a crush on Sagman for no apparent reason other than we needed a love triangle. 
So a failure at romcom,a failure at action and in between some very very good moments.But i can't stand here and say it's all bad.I really enjoyed it,i don't know why and i can't explain it but the damn thing is good.The eps really flew by and it didn't feel like it overstayed it's welcome even though it was 24 eps long.Sure there are better animes out there that can deliver much much more but still i do recommend watching it. 
Also i'm really sorry if this review was a mess but the whole anime is a mess of idon'tknowwhatiwanttodoorbe.This is the best i could do with the things presented to me.But watch it for yerselves,draw your own conclusions.

    I don't even know where to start. For the first 2-3 episodes it was actually good with all the misunderstanding and accidents that Sagara caused but that's it. Is this a school comedy or a serious military action anime? This feels weird saying this since Fullmetal Panic came out first, but it's like one big discount version of Code Geass, which actually succeeded in mixing those two genres. 
The plot is sketchy at best and makes no sense at worst. I think it's about people born with information inside them and they call give this information via telepathy but I don't know what is those ""Whispered"" people have to do with anything, feels like some fancy way to make a bond between Kaname and Sagara because nothing else fuels their romance. It feels like one of those series where a girl meet a badass guy and falls in love with him like Rurouni Kenshin except it totally fails here. There is also the black technology which I'm not even sure is seen in the anime, unless it's those AT field rip-offs used by the main antagonist. I'm not even sure if the antagonist has a plan since it's all sadism, killing, evil for the lulz, I got a secret cd, I kill my allies and I don't care if I die if something expensive explodes at the same time. I don't know what he tried to accomplish. 
The characters are all uni-dimensional and the very little character development feels out of character more than anything. You got the socially retarded military guy that cannot understand why people are angry at him after he tackled them into the ground or groped their boobs by accidents. His unawareness is funny for a little while but then you realize that's his entire character. Chidori is your basic tsundere who can't understand her feelings and you're not even sure if she has any feelings. She's also stupid and pretty shallow. Wurt or whatever his name was is a womanizer. Mei is a alcoholic. The captain commander with white hair is a bizarre character with no explanation behind her existence in the anime, she's clumsy and poor at military stuff so why is she a commander? Did she inherit the rank from a relative who was foolish enough to use someone inexperienced as his replacement? Who knows, it's not explained. Why is her advisor not the commander? 
Sometime the show likes to introduce some lowkey pedophilic humor about 30+ years old men fantasizing to get kissed by an underage girl or even receive her panties, sometime they introduce mediocre characters to create contrast and make the MC look good. I think if I went on to explain how stupid anything is in this show, I'd go into spoilers territory so I'll stop here.

    Well this anime took LA a frickin' while to finish off eh? 
Ok history, 5 years ago, LA was just getting into anime and LA tried out Full Metal Panic!, watched about 6 episodes then put it on hold due to LA's growing hatred of mecha animes (not helped by Gunparade March....no seriously LA fucking hates that anime to this day BUT revived LA's mecha interest by Gurren Lagann not too long after), that and LA didn't like really intense animes at that time (ohh boy have times changed) and thus Full Metal Panic! was shelved into LA's ""On Hold"" until now...yes that's right this anime was probably one of LA's longest unfinished anime at almost FIVE YEARS. 
Full Metal Panic! for LA can imagine is something of cult classic mecha anime combining both school life and militaristic missions of our main protagonist with little common sense to the real world Sousuke Sagara voiced by Tomokazu Seki trying to protect the rather tsundere Kaname Chidori voiced by Satsuki Yukino and the hijinks and missions they undertake in the process of it. In a ways Souskue and Chidori's dynamic is that of the reverse manic pixie girl scenario only this time Sousuke has this status while Chidori is the only getting thrown into the mess by Sousuke put her in. 
The only obvious thing about Chidori as a character is that she has something up about her which is central to the plot which has the mecha element embedded into it which has to do with the Lambda Driver and the ""Whispered"" that and the obvious tsundere feelings she has for Sousuke though it isn't really focused on as much in this season, more or less Chidori has these feelings for Sousuke but she doesn't know what to do with it with this season. With that Sousuke being the aforementioned no common sense to the real world is somewhat justified considering his background as a child solider thus having little to no sense to what the real world expects from him and goes by orders and his own instincts as a soldier. His ""backstory"" as a child soldier is expanded heavily in two arcs as well as the central villain for this season, Gauron voiced by Masahiko Tanaka who pretty much becomes Sousuke's biggest hurdle and main rival throughout this season causing major trouble for Sousuke and the crew of Mithril. 
The thing is, Gauron as a nihilistic major villain LA really didn't like him as much as this is considering LA adores such characters similar to Gauron like Nui Harime from Kill la Kill and Junko Enoshima from the Danganronpa series, so what is the difference between them?, well LA found out after much thinking that Nui Harime and Junko Enoshima had the crazy batshit personalities to back up their nihilism, however for Gauron he's stock generic towards his nihilistic nature and no personality to back himself up with all this, sure ALL THREE characters doesn't give a crap besides causing chaos and destruction for the hell of it, but LA much liked these kinds of villains to have their personalities to back it up their nihilism and Gauron just didn't have it, it's like Kefka without his Dancing Mad. 
Main character aside, the minor characters were interesting to say the least...well those that moved the plot anyways, from Melissa Mao voiced by Michiko Neya and Kurz Weber voiced by Shinichiro Miki being comrades of Sousuke to the commander of Mithril Teletha ""Tessa"" Testarossa voiced by Yukana to Shinji Kazama voiced by Mamiko Noto, a school friend Sousuke befriends and having the common interest in military armaments. The minor cast do develop along with Sousuke and Chidori through this anime though considering their minor characters the screentime is justified, BUT with that, LA's favourite character was Tessa if only because of the great contrast to Chidori and that she can be VERY badass when she needed to be.  
Plot-wise, the first season goes in arcs besides the early episodes trying to set the anime in place with all the characters and villains in the process. The arcs also have some fillery breakers episodes focusing on some of the minor cast members and this is justified as they do develop the lackluster minor cast members to some interesting additions to the cast as well as develop Sousuke or Chidori in the process of it, that and it's a great breather from all the intense action that took place prior to it all, so the pacing is consistent in this regard. Plot twists arrive and it's easy to connect the dots to all this especially revolves around Chidori and the ""Whispered"" ordeal, we don't know HOW she has it and it's never explained but all things considered it allows Chidori an ordinary civilian to interact with the more militaristic side of the cast much more. Concerning loose plot points, this season didn't do too bad and considering there are more seasons LA is expecting it answer any small loose plot points later down the line especially the romance between Sousuke and Chidori that is is in it's beleaguered stage from this first season. 
Ohh and LA know this was a 2002 anime but the fanservice at times were awkward to say the least, from out of nowhere panty shots to non-nudity moments as well as some of the characters being pervy (cept Sosuke unless he unintentionally does it) but nonetheless as somewhat rampant the fanservice is, this is the least of Full Metal Panic!'s problems and again LA thinks was another way of coping with the rather intense plot arcs Full Metal Panic! gets into. 
Animation-wise, brought to us by Gonzo, the character designs are expected from the time it was released in of 2002 along with the mech designs with some few PS1-ish style CGI when used but again it was released around the 2000's thus LA can give some leeway to the somewhat crappy blatant crappy CGI. Besides the crappy CGI, the animation was just decent and yes even with it's CGI, it was expected of the times and the animation in general just reminds LA of the 2000's animation style right down to the backgrounding and character designs aesthetics, another words, the animation was good for it's time thus ""decent"" to watch through at the very least.  
As for voice acting wise, well LA was shocked to say the least that Mamiko Noto was crossdressing voices as Shinji as much of a minor character he is but nonetheless that was interesting. Satsuki Yukino was pretty decent as the violent tsundere Chidori and Tomokazu Seki's dense strait-laced personality bound well to Sousuke. Nonetheless with all the praise, LA's favoruite voice actor easily goes to...and you know it's coming...Yukana as Tessa. 
Full Metal Panic! was an anime LA had out on hold and LA really shouldn't of that and LA's younger self was a picky little idiot, but LA picked it again after 5 years and LA enjoyed it for the most part though LA had a few problems such as Gauron as a villain to seeing some plot points coming a mile away to it's awkwardly rare fanservice sprinkled in, but nonetheless Full Metal Panic! was a good experience, from likable characters, some anime cliches twisted on it's head with a military twist and a WHOLE LOT of mecha action, blood and wholesale destruction. LA just hopes it's 2nd Season, ""Second Raid"" does flesh out the main cast a bit more especially Chidori, here's hoping!

    So here we are again. 
This is my second time watching Full Metal Panic, and i have kind of a long history with this anime. Back when i first started my anime journey, this was one of the first Mecha related anime`s that i watched. It was not because i had heard anything about it, but because i fell in love with Full Metal Panic Fumoffu, which is an anime that you can fully enjoy without watching this one. Nevertheless you will have a stronger love for the characters, and get an even better enjoyment out of it, by wathcing this one first. That is also why i give this anime 7/10 now, with a medium rewatch value, compared to my old 9/10 score. 
For me the first season is the weakest. It have some holes, here and there, were Sousuke manages to do think, they should not be able to do. Get in positions that does not make sense in the story. Still it have a charm to it, with it`s loveable character that is grounded in a very good way. Still it is clear that the anime does not know it`s strong point, which is its characters. The story itself is pretty mediocre, and i find myself wishing for some more slice of life/ school like elements, because i just want to enjoy the characters, and see them interact with one another. When it starts to propel itself  through its story, it does not really catch me, even though it should. It is possible that it is because that it is an old anime, and because of that it have a slower pacing compared to todays anime. still i think people should give this a chance, and it will more than pay off when you watch Fumoffu, because that season plays to it`s strenght. 
Something that really exceeds my expectations, is the art of the anime, especially when it portraits its characters and some of its still frames. It is able to comepete with todays anime(2018) with some of its artwork, and that is very impressive for an anime made in 2002. It will drop in quality when action happense, but that is to be expected and it is the best artwork i have ever seen for an anime that old. And in Fumoffo they up it even more! when i watched it in 2011 i thought it was new, because it was better animated than all the animes released that year, despite being made in 2003.(and that is amazing!) Fumoffo is able to comepete with some of todays anime in the art department, but this one falls short. 
Still enjoyable, and even if you don`t like mech, it deserves a chance. And if you desite that you can`t watch it, at least watch Fumoffo, because it has no mech in it.

    Sometimes when I write a review I find myself being too negative focusing on the flaws too much all the while the subject good scores. For Full Metal Panic I will start on the main flaw of the show as it has a major impact on its enjoyment. 
What may it be? Full Metal Panic has something for everyone, mecha, romance, action. A good story with a real bad ass, I love to hate him bad guy, great characters, animation that is standing the test of time and a great sound track. Well the problem is the presentation. It is clear from the start that the key to the show is the relationship between Sousuke and Chidori yet we don't see it develop and that just drove me mad. The Full Metal Panic story really needed to merge with Full Metal Panic Fumoffu and the Second Raid so their relationship could develop in between missions and not affect the plot. 
The story pits Sousuke Sagara on his toughest mission yet, protecting Kaname Chidori one of the whispered who have the key to black technology. And this means infiltrating Chidori's school. Unfortunately Sousuke, a former child soldier, isn't a natural for the mission as he as somewhat difficulty adapting to high school life and is unable to differentiate between high school, the beach and normal life and the battlefield and to make things more confusing Chidori is not the kind of damsel in distress that constantly needs rescueing from the dangers of normal life providing many a comedy moment. 
Full Metal Panic is has an enjoyable and gripping story, great characters with with great chemistry including a bad guy who you can really love to hate, good and colourful animation, I especially liked the lines under Sousuke and Chidori's for some reason, a well written script with great comedy, the voice actors did a great job and an enjoyable sound track 
If the series merged with Full Metal Panic Fumoffu and the Second Raid in to a 50+ series allowing Sousuke and Chidori's relationship to develop then Full Metal Panic would have been a potential classic instead it is an anime which is great but........

    Story: 6 
The Story is very simple. There is this girl Chidori who is a special kind of breed. She possesses knowledge about some crazy technology and she herself isn't even aware of it.  And the baddies are after her. This military organization sends souske sagara to protect her. There is where the Comedy comes in. i really liked this idea.  it's a mixture of Mecha action and comedy. But its more serious than funny. even though i found the concept quiet unique, the story overall was mediocre 
Characters: 7 
We get a large cast of characters. We have the 2 MC's Kaname and Souske. 
seeing souske being placed in normal day life was quiet humorious. with kaname we have a pretty strong female lead. Than there are the military crew mates and the captain tessa. what i found stupid was, why did they put a 16 years old girl as captain. i don't get it. Then there is the villain. he was charismatoc and enjoyable to watch. What is also a plus is that our MC's get chaaracter development. 
Art: 7 
FMP! came out in 2002 and for this the art is pretty good. there was some CGI used and it was okay. The mechafights animation was also not that bad. Thwre was never a moment where the animation got crazy good.everything was kept low. 
Sound: 5 
The OST was pretty forgetable OP and ED are mediocre. 
Enjoyment: 7 
At first i was at first skeptical but the more i wachted the more i got invested in it. it had mediocre mecha fights. it was more serious than funny and  the main cast and the villain were good. 
Overall: 6/10

    -- WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILER -- 
I was scrolling through 9gag and I find a funny anime GIF. Though I don't know what anime it is, a captain appears and kind enough to tell me the title is. Full Metal Panic, I was hoping this anime to be a comedic series it is not. It was like 10% comedy, 80% mecha fights, and 10% nonsense. Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating this series but I'll try make this review as objective as possible. 
[Story] 6/10 
Story is not the strongest point in this series. I got tired watching the main characters fighting the same enemy the entire time. And yes, the bad guy -Gauron- is the only antagonist in this series. This smiling bastard -Gauron- always crawl back from the River of Styx and the protagonist -Sagara Sousuke- is kind enough not to confirming his kill. Gauron's evil deeds knows no end, I just wondering how a human can be so evil. I thought he was a businessman but he was doing nothing but evil. And the main characters don't even realize that they had been playing on Gauron's palm the whole time. 
[Art and Animation] 7/10 
Don't expect too much, it's a 2002 anime don't compare it with the latest anime (believe it or not lots of people doing this). But I've seen better quality animation for an early 2000 anime, Full Metal Panic is just average. 
[Music] 7/10 
I like the music and the music videos are so classic, love that! 
[Characters] 5/10 
The characters are too shallow! They don't develop the characters much in this entire series. In my opinion they added too many fighting scenes (and the fighting scenes is not great either). The main protagonist, Sagara, is a skilled Arm Slave pilot and a military-freak. He's really straighforward and easily misunderstood. Lacks common sense always appears expressionless that somewhat makes him funny. Sagara mostly associated with Chidori Kaname, a short-tempered girl that can't deal with Sagara's stunts. Nothing else make her special, just average character with a special power to make the plot going. Though she can still crying and pouting nonsense in a critical situations while the others are risking their lives to fight Gauron and saving her sorry ass. And the other main character is Testarossa ""Tessa"" Teletha. She's a 16 years old genius and the Captain of the fleet. Tessa is kind enough to cry over her subordinate (underling) death. But she can't deal with Mao Mellissa very well. She always playing with her hair while thinking. This one simple thing makes her characters stands out from the rest, the other characters don't have this unique feature as Tessa. As for Gauron he's simply too evil, I won't be surprised if his middle name was ""Evil"". The other extra characters such as classmates disappear after the first half of the series. The marines are incompetent, they can't even shoot a gun from a mere 10 meters distance. And last but not least is Kalinin Andrei Sergeivich a Lieutenant Commander of the fleet. I know from a glint of his eyes that he's a true veteran of war. Unfortunately he didn't get much screen time in this series. 
[Enjoyment] 6/10 
I really enjoys the story about the characters especially when Tessa appears. But the action is kinda boring and repetitious and the fighting animation is not that great. The main plot is not really enjoyable, I just wondering when will Gauron die the entire time. 
[Conclusion] 
If you're looking for a retro action military anime then Full Metal Panic maybe perfect for you. But if you're not, give FMP a try it's worth to watch :)

    Note: This review was done while I was watching the series until I reached the end. If you're wondering why I gave the Art such a high rating go look up when this series was made. Also, this is a long ass review--don't deem it as unhelpful or crappy because it takes more than 2 minutes to read--I warned ya!! 
Its always rare to get absolutely hooked on an anime, it usually  
happens early in the series or in a heated event. Well, FMP will have  
you addicted from the very beginning(and that's a promise). I'd have to  
be honest saying that within the first 7 episodes this anime was one of  
favorites and is probably in the top five most entertaining ever. 
The Characters: Although Weber and Sagara are somewhat typical for  
their personality-type... this show uses them to their most enjoyable  
extent(yes, there will be laughs). The girl is random, realistic,  
clever, and really makes this title easier to relate to - Definitely one of the  
best eyecandy female characters in anime history. Sagara will  
definitely surprise you here and there - his spontaneous-ness doesn't  
go with his persona... but it grows on you and makes him lovable.  
Sousuke & Chidori... did you ever notice that?  
Even though this show is funny and 'kawaii' it still  
manages some of the best dramatic love, shootout, and loyalty scenes  
I've seen in ANYTHING. The amount of action is good and it's not that  
much of a tear-jerker. Basically; it has all the right ingredients. 
Now I'm not just gonna rant about only the good parts 'cause I'm  
ecstatic over it right now - here are some downsides to the show:  
Animation is good/standard, but if was only a little glossier this  
series would be a diamond. -  Not enough romance, it just seems that the  
sexual tension provided and the little bit of actual romantic scenes  
are just not enough... given I'm saying that because they WERE so good!  Things really should've gotten a little steamier between Sagara and  
Chidori considering a lot of the time she was half naked.  
All my claims in this review can pretty much be summed up to the  
Hospital scene. If you don't believe me that is. 
Throughout the series the show will go back to its old lovable roots!!  
And also, Sagara & Chidori's romance grows more adorable.  
Another problem with this show is the battles; often confusing and  
there's just not enough emotion considering what's going on(especially  
the old-friends battle). 
This show is practical, romantic, exciting, and interesting enough to  
keep just about anyone tuned in. A true landmark title. 9/10 In the  
sense of overall(considering this anime isn't perfect I just had a  
perfect time watching it). But as far as personally: 10/10. - It's just so enjoyable, and in my opinion--that's all that really matters. It's kinda like that really really greasy piece of generic pizza that tastes better than anything... there is better out there, but you're fine with this.  
In the final episode you'll find yourself anticipating a disappointing  
or unworthy ending, you will not receive it however.  
The biggest problem with this anime is that it's very much dragged out,  
but thank God it is!! I got teary at the end just because it was  
ending...

    Bullshit x 1000. 
Story: The whole show was unfunny, and so boring that I couldn't pay attention to what ever the hell, was going on. 
Characters: Just completely annoying characters. The only one I can remember is Chidori, because her name reminds me of Naruto I guess. 
I can't say much because it just bored me too the extreme. After 1 week or so after I completed watching this, I couldn't remember what the whole plot was or how it looked like, OR who the characters were. The only reason I watched was because of the high ratings. BullShit. 
This show is a plain piece of crap wearing a hat. Dunno, just sucked.

    I'll be honest; I once believed this to be the greatest anime ever, before I actually seriously began watching anime. After re-watching it again sometime last year, I realised that perhaps I was wrong, it's in no way the best anime ever, however, I still consider it to be one of the funniest anime I've seen. I'll base this review on the re-watch of the anime. 
I'll start with the story. It starts off strongly, and continues with its strong introduction throughout the first ten or so episodes. Then it gets to the filler episodes, and they are truly terrible. Well, when I say 'they' I'm actually referring to one in particular, which features a carnival and tries too hard to blend the robots with comedy. Only one of the filler episodes is really worth watching, as it expands the relationship of two of the supporting characters, but besides that the rest are watchable only once. The wave of filler only lasts for about three episodes, then it gets back into the quality of the first ten episodes right until the end. The second (and only other) problem I have with the story is that there are some rather stupidly illogical decisions made in the last episode or two that could have allowed the entire last battle to be avoided. Besides those flaws, the story really works well, fulfilling all of the elements of action/comedy nicely. 
The art, considering when the series was made (2003) is great to behold, with the animation during fights remaining fluid, while characters are detailed and backgrounds are consistently well-designed and nice to look at without detracting from the scene at hand.  
The music is fitting and fulfills the required role to match each scene, however none of it really stood out to me as anything outstanding. None of it's unlistenable or annoying though. 
The characters, for the most part, are likable and well developed throughout the series. The main character, Souske Sagara, hardly develops over the course of the series, which isn't such a bad thing considering his circumstances, going from the battlefield to a high school in which he has no experience whatsoever. His personality contrasts with that of the female lead, Kaname Chidori, the popular high school student who is easily agitated at seemingly every action Souske exhibits. Despite this contrast, the two characters have an undeniable chemistry that develops over the course of the series, which makes their banter rather amusing. The supporting characters all fill their roles, providing ample comedy relief when needed, and filling the archetypal action role when the series hits its more serious stages.  
So yeah, overall the series mixes the action of mechs with highschool comedy incredibly well, allowing enough of a blend without one ever being overbearing. Full Metal Panic is thoroughly enjoyable, and is well worth the time invested.  
Sorry if this was a bit sketchy, it's my first review on here. I'm sure I'll warm to it shortly!

    Beautiful anime, it has it all!, drama, funny moments, romance, great main characters, mechas and bad ass antagonist, I like the background of Souske Sagara and how it tries to fit in Japanese society meanwhile protecting Chidori, the most beautiful anime girl I have seen, also nice Mechas in story, It fill my senses, very nice, 10! 
Opening and ending themes are fantastic, I am from Bolivia and I would like it to have been doubled because of Fummoffu is something great, but in japanese you engage with Main character Sagara Souske unique personality and all his struggle to set free from military standars.

    Direction is something I don’t bring up too often, and that’s because, well, it’s hard to properly describe. Don’t get me wrong, a good director is most certainly important, not just for Anime but for any form of media. However it’s hard to say how much of a show’s issues can be blamed on direction or how many can’t. Direction doesn’t just involve shot composition, but also the way how the music synchs up with the scene, the overall feeling the scene is meant to have, that kind of stuff. And of course, then there’s the matter of writing vs. directing: Which is more important? 
Why am I mentioning all of this? Well, you see… Full Metal Panic! is MOST CERTAINLY a series that is held up by the quality of its writing rather than its direction. 
Based on Gatoh Shinji’s Light Novel Series, Full Metal Panic! is… a strange beast indeed. While the Mecha Anime genre is most certainly extremely flexible, and to be fair it is no stranger to high school hijinks… for Super Robot shows, that is. That is not the case for the more semi-grounded Real Robot genre (Emphasis on the semi in semi-grounded, by the way. The genre is really fond of making up its own amount of bullshit science). 
This in turn causes an odd disconnect. Half the show is your typical real-robot show that just so happens to have a slightly heavier focus on romance than most. On the other have you have a semi-slice of life featuring a Chirico Cuvie parody in the middle of a romantic comedy. It is strange to be sure, but weirdly charming in its own way. That’s part of why I like this show, really, it has its own messed up sense of style and runs with it. It’s quite enjoyable, to say the least, though I do wish I could go with more of one or the other at times, kinda like how the LNs had the main volumes be nonstop drama with a bit of comedy (Bar Volume 6, which is apparently exclusively comedy) and relegating most of the hijinks to side stories. 
It also avoids the issue many modern LN adaptations have of not knowing where to end, as in spite of this show covering 3 of the 13 Volumes of the source, it does feel like an actual ending. Mind you, given that it is only 3 Volumes, they kinda had to do some work to stretch it out to 24 episodes, in this case just adding a ton of filler. Most of it is harmless though, and at times quite amusing, my favorites being Kazama’s spotlight episode and the one focusing on how the Uruz team met. That said, not all of them are winners, namely a frankly dragged out desert mini-arc that quickly outweighed its welcome, even if it did pick up by the end, and in spite of me overall liking her as a character, Inaba’s debut episode could’ve also been better. 
As for those pesky narrations and internal monologues Light Novels have, thankfully FMP has always been rather lax with them, so transitioning them into animation is surprisingly easy. There are a few cases in which they do kinda forget about a few of them (The most glaring for me being the whole reason Chidori did something really stupid in the second story arc, namely that she was pissed off as she felt that Sousuke didn’t trust her) and on a more amusing note most of the movie references have been sadly cut (Like Chidori directly name-dropping Sean Connery) but overall not that much is lost and the transition between mediums is overall solid... mostly. More on that later. 
Ah, such a lovable cast. As said before, Sagara Sousuke is basically a parody of the type of character Chirico Cuvie from VOTOMS established.  He’s cold, stoic and keeps to himself (Though in general he’s far more emotional than the usual examples of this archetype) but he’s in the middle of a romantic comedy so his behavior is mostly played for laughs. In turn his co-star Chidori Kaname, who is a Takahashi Rumiko Tsundere (Even shares her voice actress with one of the most popular ones: Higurashi Kagome) being put into a Real Robot series and is slowly driven insane by her love interest’s behavior. It is a match made in heaven, to say the least. 
The supporting cast in turn is more of what you would expect. Tessa serves as the third main character, continuing Misumaru Yurika’s line of ditzy captains, though at least Tessa’s competence isn’t dependent on what would be funnier. Kurz and Mao serve as the Kaji and Misato of the show: Prime material to get drunk and do something really dumb that will be hilarious, though Kurz sure takes the pervert part of his character as far as possible. And of course there is Andrei Serqeivitch Kalinin, who is basically every badass commander from every military… thing fused together and I love it! 
As for the villains, well… the kid who kept adoring his sister was kinda tragic… same goes for said “Sister”… yeah, let’s stop beating around the bush and talking about the main man: Gauron. This guy… how do I put it? Well… I guess you could say he is Yazan Gable, but with the crazy turned up to eleven and given Patrick Colasour’s amazing survival skills. He is sadistic, relentless and he just won’t stay dead. Needless to say, he is quite the effective antagonist. 
Sadly the show starts to fall apart once you get into the presentation. This show has not aged that well visually. Admittedly the animation isn’t too bad or anything, but at the same time it is unremarkable. Everything looks fine, but that’s about it really. The direction is what really drags it down, though. This is a rather blandly directed show, to say the least. There are some moments that are actually really well done, but overall, it is moreso due to the strength of the writing that the show is allowed to be good rather than the way said scenes are presented. It’s hard to describe, but if I had to put it one way, is that scenes that were originally huge and extremely emotionally impactful now… well, the impact is still there, but not as notable. 
Good designs overall, though the quality of the animation prevents them from standing out. The Albarest is a great main mecha in its own right, simple in all the right ways. The rest is pretty good too, though I will have to warn you all that this show doesn’t have many custom units, so there are mostly generic grunt suits. To be fair, the Novels weren’t exactly made with the intention of selling toys to begin with, but oh well. 
Composed by Sahashi Toshihiko of Gundam SEED fame, the Soundtrack is great. All of it fits with the militaristic atmosphere, yet at the same time the more lighthearted themes don’t feel out of place, with my favorite tracks being “Arashi No Mae” and “Plan 1056”. As for the opening, I’m not the biggest fan of “Tomorrow”, nor the Ending Theme, ""Karenai Hana"", but I can see the appeal in them. This is where the direction starts hurting the show again, though, as many tracks are just not utilized to their full capacity, as they either not synch up with the scene as well as they could or are used in moments silence would've been better. A shame, really… 
Thankfully, the cast isn’t hampered down by the directing. To this day Sousuke remains my favorite role in Seki Tomokazu’s career, and even though his performance hasn’t quite peaked yet, this is still an overall great performance. His co-stars Yukino Satsuki and Nogami Yukana (Her Big Break into voice acting, no less) do a great job bouncing off him, especially Yukino. Also, props to veteran voice actor Tanaka Masahiko for a deliciousy hammy performance. Besides them there’s Neya Michiko, Miki Shinichiro, Nishimura Tomoichi, Noto Mamiko (In a rare male role, no less), Chiba Susumu, Yamaguchi Yuriko, Otsuka Akio, Natsuki Rio, Koyasu Takehito, Takahashi Mikako and Inada Tetsu in an absolutely HILARIOUS casting gag. 
While Full Metal Panic! isn’t a perfect show by any means as its presentation does hold it back, I do feel it is ultimately a good one. I can see why it was so popular back in the day, and why even now it continues to have a small but dedicated cult following. If you’re a fan of giant robots, romance, drama, comedy or all the above, I can calmly recommend this show. Just make sure the copy you end up buying isn’t booby trapped, because if so, explosions will ensue. 
Final Score: 7/10

    Wow. Just wow. This anime has some minor flaws, some incoherence but overall :  
- Story is clearly well done, simple enough to be understood easily, but deep enough to not be guessed to much. Alternating light comedy and serious drama.  
- Art is really nice, especially if you like anime of this epoch, old-and-simple style. 
- Sound design is well done, and some musics are really cool, inspiring, and from an original creating comparing to music you usually hear in animes.  
- Characters are various, well balanced and well developed.  
Enjoyment : Maximal in my opinion.  
Overall : DUDE ITS 2020 in less than one month, this anime aired in 2003 and some of the series aired in 2018 as a reminder, how  come you didn't watched it yet ?

    Full Metal Panic! is an undoubtedly interesting mecha series, but it has many weaknesses. 
Story [7+] 
The story is divided in two main plot lines: the mecha one and the high school rom com one. Full Metal Panic! greatest accomplishment is how it blends these two genres together: even if the mecha plot line has more screen time, the rom com parts are at the same time fun and essential for the development of the main characters. 
The plot itself is quite simple, and the obscure mysteries around the mechas’ technology keep the viewer’s interest high. 
Art [7] 
In the first place, the character design of the main characters is very good; despite this, the animation is not always on point, and even if it’s never really bad, it’s not great either. 
Beside that, even if the action scenes’ choreography is not that great, they are exciting due to their high stakes. 
Sound [6-] 
The weakest part of the show. The OP is okay, but it’s not really special. 
The most part of the OST of Full Metal Panic! sounds like a mediocre copy of an 80’s action series soundtrack like The A-Team or Hazzard. 
Character [7-] 
The main characters of Full Metal Panic! are quite good. They’re not super-deep or anything, but they fit very well in their role, especially Testarossa and Kaname. 
The side characters are very enjoyable at times (for example, most of the soldiers of the Mithril are really interesting), and very bland at others (the main antagonist is really unbearable and flat). 
Enjoyment [8-] 
Even if the series itself is not that great as a work of art, I really enjoyed the series as an entertaining mecha show. 
It’s not as deep as Neon Genesis Evangelion or Bokurano, or other psychological mechas, but it’s a funny and thrilling way to spend your free time watching giant robots fighting and beautiful waifus being badass.  
Overall [7-] 
To sum up, I won’t recommend this show to you except if you are a huge mecha fan and can stand early-00’s mediocre animation. 
In conclusion, I personally enjoyed this show and I’m really looking to watch other entries of the Full Metal Panic! universe.

    I won't get too technical about the series since there has been already a lot said about that. I would just like to say why I liked this anime very much. 
First, it's has a good story. It has both serious plotlines and light moments, action and comedy - which were well balanced. One minute your heart is pounding with excitement then you're laughing over Souske's &quot;army fanboy-ism.&quot; 
Second, the characters are interesting: from the playboy sharpshooter to the teenage captain and even to the villain. My favorite, of course, would be Sagara Sousuke. I would describe him as sort of like Jack Bauer (of 24) or John McClane (of Die Hard), simply because he just.won't.die! LOL. But as a teenage sergeant who grew up on different warzones, he still has a lot to learn about living a normal high school life. He comes out like an insensitive rock, but he is a charming insensitive rock. If that makes sense. 
Overall, I think FMP is really well done (art, music, etc.) and I'm interested in watching the rest of the series. I would gladly recommend it to any anime fan.

    Full Metal Panic!, being the first anime I ever completed, was probably the most enjoyable anime I have ever seen.  Whether this is because the show is actually extremely incredible or because it was the first thing I watched is unsure, but I am going to proceed to give it an amazing review just because of my love for the show. 
STORY  9  : The story of Full Metal Panic! (a guy named Sousuke Sagara, who works for an elite military like group, is put on a mission to watch over an extremely attractive blue haired female high school student named Kaname Chidori).  Since Sousuke knows nothing of a high school student's life, he acts somewhat insane around her and her friends, so the show has some serious action and some hilarious humor.  The reason I like the story so much is because it has a little bit of everything.  It stretches from good mech fight scenes to humorous scenes about high schoolers living normal lives to romantic scenes with relationships between characters.  I know other shows do this sort of thing, but I think this show does is quite well. 
ART  8  : As far as the art goes, I really like the art style used in the show.  I think the characters look believably real, which helps with the plot of this show.  I also think the character's looks are fit their character types quite well, especially Sousuke, another great thing about the style is that it makes some of the characters rather hot (Tessa).  I understand that the animation itself is nothing to cream a ton over, but I mean for when it was made I think it is at its A game. 
SOUND  8  : The songs in the show are some of my favorites, the opening is still probably one of my favorite opening songs. I also think the sounds in the show are believable as well and some of them are hilarious.  I watched it dubbed, so I'm not sure about the japanese voices, but I think the English dub is done well also. 
CHARACTER  9  : Okay this is where the show really pushes out what it has to offer.  The characters are done so well that it makes you feel like this could actually happen.  You have Sousuke, a military driven guy who thinks every little thing is a threat to the entire world.  He does some insane things that made me laugh out loud watching this, which is weird because other people were probably in my house when I watched this with headphones on.  Kaname is a more typical teen, athletic, somewhat popular, kind of tough, and kind.  Oh yea and lets not forget what i said about her earlier.  The third main character, Tessa, who acts as a somewhat timid person, who also happens to be Sousuke's captain is probably one of the best, if not the best character.  She is extremely nice and likeable. 
ENJOYMENT  10  : When I started watching this show I was like okay I'll give anime a try again, I had tried to watch Fullmetal Alchemist at one point, but had trouble getting into it.  DON'T HATE ME FOR THIS, I HAVE NOW WATCHED THE SHOW I THINK IT WAS JUST BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE ABOUT ANIME, I NOW KNOW MY MISTAKE, AND I ALSO THINK FMA IS INCREDIBLE.  I also watched a lot of Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ when I was young but I'm talking about more recent, less popular anime.  But like I was saying earlier I began watching it and after a while I got extremely hooked and I became the somewhat otaku I am now.  I enjoyed this show so much because it opened up anime for me by pushing a little of each genre out like I said earlier. 
OVERALL  10  : Overall Fullmetal Panic! is sexy.  I mean it has something most everyone can enjoy and it is done extremely well.  Now if you havn't seen it I would extremely recommend it, I will say the pilot is not perfect, but it at least sets up Sousuke for you.  Just keep watching and enjoy.  The show will have you on the edge of your seat at points, pissed off at points, rofling at points, among other things.  The show is just fun to watch and is just a great mix of things.  So get to watching! 
And also -- Fumo! Fumo!

    FMP was a great anime if you're looking for a comedy romance with action involve. The main character Hero Sagara Sousuke was a really dump at love sense, he has no clue about others feeling especially womens. The Heroine Kaname Chidori has a short tempered and also cute for some reason. Supported by energic and pervert character that really makes me crazy named Kurz Weiber, and sexy officer Mao who take care of Sagara and Kurz, and also their Commander Teletha Testarossa who's makes loli fans will love her. 
The story it self is telling about Chidori peacefull school life that been ended because she was being targeted by terorist organization who after her ability's called ""whispered"". Sousuke and his team was being order from Mithrils (an organization that has purpose to stablize a peace of the world) to guard Chidori from enemies. 
Some romance happen between the two main character, and also Tessa (Teletha nick name) who makes triangle romance better. And like I said before, some action involve too in this anime, there was a good scene where's great mecha or combat battle makes FMP more worthed to watch. 
I really recomended this anime and the secuel series for you who seeks a great anime story.

     Synopsis:  
Sagara Sosuke may look like a high school boy, but he is anything but your average teenager: hardened by years of battle, he is now one of the most skilled (and humorless) operatives of the secretive and powerful paramilitary MITHRIL organization. All this changes, however, when he, along with the lecherous sniper Kurtz Weber and ornery commander Melissa Mao, are assigned to protect pretty young Chidori Kaname, who may be one of the mysterious and sought-after ""Whispered."" Trained assassins, mech-piloting psychopaths, and booby traps, Sagara can deal with... it's infiltrating a Japanese high school and trying to blend in that's the real challenge. And he will learn that an enraged girl can be the most lethal opponent of all. 
Review: 
Full Metal Panic takes the well-traveled genres of high school comedy and mecha war drama, mixes them together in the same series, dresses them up in beautiful Gonzo animation, gives them a gritty twist, and wraps them together in a plot hinting at unearthly technology and dark organizations at work. Unfortunately, none of that can hide the fact that in the end Full Metal Panic is just another anime series, never breaking from the cliches of its two genres--the girls still club the hero in a berserk rage at the slightest perception of lechery, even hardened military professionals take time out for a soak in the bath, and you can never, ever use your ultimate weapon until the last possible second. That the plot ends up going nowhere at all (at least until a sequel series) and the two genres feel somewhat uncomfortable next to each other doesn't help, either. It's still well made and a lot of fun, but it isn't half of what it could've been.  
Full Metal Panic is definitely at its strongest in the comedy department. The premise--a young soldier who knows nothing but battle forced to try and blend in at an average Japanese high school while undercover--has loads of potential, and Sosuke's deadpan determination and brutal practicality contrast perfectly with a lively cast of more standard anime characters to capitalize on it.  
Sosuke is hilarious in his awkward attempts to fit in, and the series also takes the time to put his normal classmates into his world on occasion, providing a satisfying role reversal. Sosuke's foil, Chidori, is equally likable for the opposite reasons--a slight sidestep from your standard high school cutie, she's got a vicious temper and isn't afraid to loose it on Sosuke, but also has an earnest sweet side for balance. Chidori is something of a realistic caricature--you know the role, but something rings true about the way her exaggerated personality traits fit together, making her a particularly appealing character.  
The quality assortment of supplemental characters include Sosuke's far livelier (and more mature, a nice departure from formula) military compatriots who themselves have some amusing interactions with Sosuke's classmates. Those classmates range from Chidori's snapshot-obsessed best friend to a shy military geek (ironically, and amusingly, the only one who Sosuke can manage a conversation with). There are also a variety of more hardened military types who make appearances, and they are generally treated relatively realistically.  
Unfortunately, those times where the fun characters in the series overlap with the serious ones are one of its weakest points. The biggest problem is that Chidori behaves more or less like your standard anime schoolgirl even in the face of life-or-death situations, cheapening the drama at the gritty end of the story. Complaining about her lack of decency in the middle of a firefight, for example, showed little of the sense of reality or self-preservation you'd expect from her character. There are a few stronger points (a great reference to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, for example), but for the most part the more humorous characters severely hurt the realism and sense of danger of the more serious parts when they interact.  
That brings me to my second big problem with the series: the drama. On the positive side, the serious sections of the story aren't bad by anime standards--they've got a gritty feel, Sosuke is if nothing else a competent warrior (a welcome change from all those kids uncertain of their worth), and the handheld-style camerawork gives the action a sense of reality. In a couple of places the tragedy of war also crosses briefly from action movie cliche to something a bit more affecting.  
On the negative side, it still feels much more like a cheesy action movie than the military drama it seems to be aiming for (particularly in the grittiest story arc, a desert mission in the middle of the series). In contrast with most of the well-developed characters, the caricatured military folks working with Sosuke feel hollow, and after all the talk about planning, strategy, and loyalty, having Sosuke inexplicably save his ultimate weapon until the last possible second is downright silly. The fact that the giant robots, for all their clunky ""realistic"" design, end up sporting emotion-powered ultimate weapons (and of course a big mane of hair on the evil mech) struck me as rather silly as well.  
That Full Metal Panic is a better comedy than a drama perhaps isn't surprising, but what is is how the two are combined. Or rather, how they aren't: The series is composed of roughly equal parts schoolyard comedy and military action, and although the characters overlap, the two parts have absolutely no interaction. One episode will be a rather silly comedy, and the next will try for straight-faced drama and action. The transitions are a bit jarring at best, and leave the series as a whole feeling somewhat scattered.  
One more big complaint before I move on: the plot goes absolutely nowhere. It starts right off with hints of powerful clandestine forces at work, mysterious technology and its connection to the Whispered, and a creepy villain (a worthy rival for Sosuke's dry sense of duty thanks to his cheerful contempt and unstable persona) who seems to be working behind the scenes as part of some dark conspiracy.  
Sadly, though the villain comes back again and again as a part of various nefarious plots, there is never any explanation of where he keeps getting his extraordinarily nasty toys or who's backing him. There's also no meaningful connection established between the story arcs, no details about what the Whispered are or where the mysterious technology comes from are ever revealed, and there isn't even an end more satisfying than ""We got the bad guy. Yet again.""  
All the hints of mystery in the story and the creepy villain felt like an afterthought tacked on to try and cover for the fact that the plot as a whole has absolutely no substance, and doesn't go anywhere.  
Fortunately, action fans will probably be more than willing to overlook the generic parts thanks to the gorgeous Gonzo animation. As with most of their work, they give even classic mech-vs-mech action scenes a sense of gritty realism by combining shaky camerawork with a lot of perfectly-executed digital effects (motion blur, glows, and various shockwave distortions). The mech fights aren't quite as down-to-earth as I was hoping (there are a disappointing number of energy blasts and flying jumps), but it still ranks among the best in the genre.  
The quality art and animation don't stop at the action scenes, though--all the art is detailed and attractive, and the character animation is topnotch. Chidori in particular is amazingly expressive--her face and body language make her character truly memorable. The fancy action techniques aren't limited to the big fights, either--plenty of creative stuff around school, as well.  
Last is the vocal part of the series, which is on par with the visuals--very good (at least in Japanese--I can't speak for the dub). The standout performances are easily Sosuke, for his unwavering deadpan delivery through both drama and comedy, and Chidori, for her endless reserve of energy and mix of ornery and sweet, all while staying believable as a character. The minor characters are just as good, though; Mao and Kurtz both have likable voices with a touch of playful realism that breaks them out of their respective molds, the villain has a smarmy evilness in his voice, tinged with just enough crazy to make him scary, and the collection of minor characters all work well. The music, though generally good (including the catchy if unoriginal opening theme), isn't nearly as memorable, but it does the job.  
In all, Full Metal Panic is an enjoyable series. It is not without flaws: It's not nearly as original as it initially appears, the transition between war drama and schoolyard comedy doesn't work terribly well, and all the hints at a larger plot go nowhere at all in the end. Still, the collection of likable and creative characters and comedy with an edge are enough to make it memorable and fun. It's definitely worth a shot if the idea sounds at all appealing, and those less picky about details will probably love it.

    I'm gonna try it without any spoiler, but plain and simple: A must see for every fan of anime! 
It's my favourite anime of all those I've seen so far, simply because you can sense the situations and emotions involved (awesome voiceacting for this show), there were funny moments, but never over the top (no big silly heads or that sort of things), heartthrilling actionscenes, and that so familiar magic between the 2 main characters, all that that makes this show into a superb anime, that you just have to see.  
characters 10/10 
you have it all, history, background, profiles that they stick to. They start out with an idea for a person, they implemented it into the anime, and every character stayed true to what they were made for. a warfreak, stays a warfreak, a gentle teeanage girl mostly stays a gently teenage gir (if you see the anime you'll understand why I say mostly :-p) la perv stays a perv. and not a single character gives you the idea that they shouldn't belong there. 
Story 10/10 
I'm not gonna spoil this for you, watch it, you'll fall in love immediatly (unless you're an actionfreak, then you'll have to wait a bit after the first scene of ep 1, cause you'll have some characterbuilding for some eps). 
enjoyment 10/10 
YOU WILL LOVE WATCHING THIS!!! It's truly a piece of art. I loved every moment I watched this anime. 
What are you doing, go watch, NOW!!! 
I really wish I could tell you all about it, but then I'd just spoil it for you, and I don't think a review should do that with a show like this. So without a doubt, watch it, enjoy all three seasons like I did, and promote it to your friends. 
have fun watching :-).

        Unlike most users on here, I did not watch this when I was younger. There was no nostalgia at all while I watched this: it's an actual review based upon the anime itself. 
    FMP! is guilty of many offenses despite hailing form the towns of ""Generic City"" and ""Who Gives a Fuck, It'll Make Money-topia."" There is not one original idea in this entire anime. And sure, you could argue that most animes don't have an original idea, but at least most accomplish something. Enough ranting, I'll actually review the aspects of the show. 
    First off, the story was plagued with several issues. The most egregious being the balance of action and FMP!'s idea of comedy.  I would not be surprised to find out that the writers simply designated each episode as ""a funny one"" or ""a fighting one."" There is absolutely no balance. Also, don't confuse my use of the word ""comedy"" as an implication of FMP! being funny in any way. The series' idea of comedy revolves around this: 
- ""I do not know much about social situations, so I will completely throw any form of common sense out of the window and do the first thing I think of."" 
- ""OH MY GOD YOU PERVERT IDIOT! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!"" *hit him in the head* 
    Fucking awful slapstick humor. 
 I don't want to waste more time writing this so: 
Art: Same shit as always, blah blah.  
Sound: See above. 
Character: Every character in FMP! is either shallow as fuck or just an idiot. Choose which you like better. 
Enjoyment: Hahahahahahahahahah, right.

    It was a mediocre anime, while the first arc was quite good and succeed in having a comedy/action anime, what came next was either boring, confusing and at times just frustrating. 
To begin with, what the anime does well, the characters while being quite generic, are likable and have some good interaction, the main duo (Chidori and Sousuke) works really well both in the comedy and more serious scene. The world introduces is interesting and believable (at least at the beginning) and the comedy is quite good but that subjective. 
The problems begin to appear in the second arc (from ep9), mainly it's really confusing: we know nothing of the enemy but some character are for strange reason connect to them, the terrorist goal makes no sense and for some reason the commander is left without any protection,... but while that arc is confusing it's far from being as annoying as that pile of shit that is the third arc.  
First the enemy of the arc is again Goron, second what should have been an elite team from mithril, is a group of moron who didn't listen to the info they were given and the man add to their team because he is a specialist, they have tactics on par with a shonen protagonist (attack from the front, without cover and without knowing where their target is), and to add to their stupidity they know of the borderline magic lambda drive, that the enemy as one but don't act accordingly. 
And unfortunately Sousuke isn't better, and never use the lambda drive outside of the final battle, when it would have been very useful against his former friend. And obviously, he never confirms the kill, so that the final arc villain can be Goron. 
I will be short for the fourth arc because: it's like the third but a little less retard, and with some development on the plot. 
Overall it was mediocre with a good start and a really bad third and fourth arc, in fact, the filler episodes, more focus on comedy and characters, were way better than the regular episode in the second half of the series. To conclude the author should have stick to comedy where he is quite good, which is confirmed by Full metal panic fumaffu which is way better.

    [REVIEW WITHOUT SPOILERS] 
Full Metal Panic! is a particular anime in every aspect. 
Is it a robot/mecha anime? I expected so, after all there is a ""Full Metal"" right in the title, cover images show you those robots, so it has to be a mecha title. 
Well, yes and no. 
Mecha's are present and are a good part of the action, you will find battles and strategies and more. Yet, that is not the primary focus of the anime. 
What is it about then? 
It's really all about the final part, ""Panic!"": mind the exclamation mark (""!""), because that's the most important part. Let's see better. 
THE FULL METAL: STORY, ART, SOUND (8) 
The story is rather interesting, although it is not particularly complex. It flows well, there are good and evil ones, battles and more, but don't expect particular twists or surprises. Art is also good, with very nice drawing and an entertaining color palette: this is a nice anime to watch. The soundtrack does its job: it has a set number of themes that are repeated on and on, but they are spot on and nicely shape the atmosphere. 
THE PANIC!: CHARACTERS and ENJOYMENT (10) 
That's what makes this anime special and different from the many others: the characters, and the enjoyment level they bring in. This is really an anime about people and their reactions. Sure, sometimes it's exaggerated. Sure, sometimes it is strange. But oh well, it is just pure fun. It takes people (like the two main characters) and sets the stage for a human comedy. A comedy of fun, passions, thoughts, social interactions. It fills your heart and your soul, and succeeds in what an excellent anime should do: make you wonder what happens next. Not so much for the mecha's and the battles, for the technologies or the mysteries: the plot line is just the background behind, because it's the actors that fill the stage. This anime is addictive, and grows within you. It's like an exclamation mark after a word: it's not just words that matter, but how you say them. 
And so at the end of the ride you will be left with those sensations that only the best anime leave: enjoyment for the show, and sadness because it's ended. Until the moment you go on with the sequel, that is, when that ride of emotions will start again to roller-coaster, and capture again your heart. 
Always with an exclamation mark!

    There is literally nothing about Full Metal Panic! that adds up to being anything more than derivative. It's filled with cliched characters and scenarios, the animation looks horrendous by today's (2011) standards, the voice acting is extremely hollow with only a couple exceptions, the writing is unintentionally laughable frequently, plot threads are started but never resolved, there's pointless filler episodes, etc, etc. 
Never has the urge been so strong to stop watching an anime half way through, that exact point being a confoundedly stupid episode in which men in giant robots compete at table tennis and tug of war. Don't get me wrong, this show is actually best at its most lighthearted. Unfortunately, this is one of those cases where the goofiness and seriousness are so awkwardly juxtaposed, that it ends up feeling like idiocy that takes itself very seriously. 
Maybe there's something I'm missing here, but I can't find anything redeeming about this series. If it were older, I might be able to see as an influence to the giant robot genre, but 2002 really wasn't that long ago. It really kind of feels like a relic that would have been more at home in the early days of the genre, with the likes of Gundam, and Gunbuster. 
I realize that maybe I'm being overly critical of something that is just meant to be casually enjoyed and not dissected and analyzed like the best anime can hold up to, but if every step of the way, you are wondering why you are bothering to watch, it's not worth it.

    Hi! Time for Robert's Too Late Reviews! This time we're stepping all the way back to 2002 to take a look at Full Metal Panic!, a mecha comedy/action/light romance anime. I actually did a review on the latest season which was revived and aired in the past year, but didn't realize at the time I hadn't reviewed the beginning of the show! Today we're here to correct that! I'm going to be dealing with the dubbed version and only talking season 1. I might come back and update after rewatching the Second Raid. I plan for the season entitled ""FMP! Fumoffu"" to get it's own review as it's really a whole different pony show. As the overall number shows, I did quite enjoy FMP! and think there's something for most anyone's tastes to enjoy. However, this time I would suggest not giving up on it in the first few episodes, as it doesn't gel as quickly as other titles. Now let's get to it, see if we get some new wallpaper for the RTLR wall of mecha warfare! 
Story: 7 
The story is really your basic 'fish out of water' plot. We have this version built around a young lady that possesses information subconsciously that is of great power, being protected by a life long soldier who has an awful time adjusting to his new undercover assignment. The pair of course go through the story and develop feelings for each other, as such things often happen. As I've said before, and will likely say again in the future, knowing the general course of things doesn't mean we can't enjoy the ride. FMP! falls squarely in this territory, and yet, it's not really all that much of an issue.  
Our female lead, Kaname, is an energetic high school girl who has information inside her that relates to what is called 'black technology' and the operation of a near magical power inside certain mech robots called the 'Lambda Driver'. This is a real Macguffin as the only mention of origin for this information is explained by telling her she's known it 'since before she was born'. As Kaname's parents are completely out of the picture, to the level of pointedly remarking on living alone a few times, there's no chance for her to really discover how she becomes one of the 'Whispered' with the information. That is one place you just have to roll with 'because' being the only answer to the question of 'why is she a Whispered?' 
Because she has this information that somehow would greatly benefit anyone that could access it, a mercenary group not tied to any government but with morals that make Superman look like an ass, decides to send a trio of mech pilots to protect Kaname from shadowy, evil-type peoples. In the group is the blonde playboy Kurz, the kickass Melissa, and finally our male lead Sousuke. He's the only one of the three young enough to pass off as a student, so Sousuke is enrolled into high school to serve as Kaname's bodyguard, with all of this being unbeknownst to Kaname herself.  
Of course, hijinks ensue as Sousuke has been a soldier for so long that he doesn't have a single clue how to even appear as a civilian, let alone operate a cover as one. His personal details, revealed throughout the series shows that he's been in war after war for pretty much his whole life. This is where our fish flops on the land. He operates as though there is an assassin or kidnapper in every corner, and takes every small thing as a huge tactical threat. At first, his ability to even laughably hold his cover is missing, as he's often pulling his gun on other students, tackling and interrogating people, and just generally acting like a 'military maniac' as Kaname calls him.  
Even after the story stabilizes a handful of episodes in, FMP! keeps this humorous angle intact. Kaname, even after discovering the mercenaries and the truth of what's locked in her mind *still* smacks Sousuke around for being completely overbearing and nearly ruining her entire high school experience. Kaname is a bit of a fish out of water as well, when she learns she's in the center of a very dangerous situation by prospect of just being a Whispered in general. This often finds her in the middle of battles or having to be rescued by Sousuke and the team. This still doesn't keep him from taking a fan to the forehead, as she's a bit quick to convert her fear to anger and taking that anger out on poor Sousuke.  
As FMP! moves down the stretch, Kaname and Sousuke begin to develop a relationship based on more than just military necessity. Like any number of other movies, tv shows, and anime, being in constant stressful conditions causes a bond between the two, though they don't make it as far as anything serious. The show is geared mainly around the battle actions and the comedy. I think this is a good call, as it keeps from bogging the series down. (A flaw I noted in FMP! Invisible Victory season) 
We end up with awesome robot battles and sweet action framed by the slightly sweet but mostly funny relationship between Sousuke and Kaname, and together it works, maybe even better than the sum of the parts in general. Throw in a very menacing villain who has personal history with Sousuke, and the mysterious mercenary captain who is so much more than she seems and what comes out of the oven is a fun little show.  
The mechs, that's the question, right? They look good, they are not this bland CG makes of more recent titles. Nor are they the overly busy 'Transformers (movies)' looking creations either. They are well drawn and fluid in their motions. In fact, they sometimes seem to be a little too fluid, leaping about nimbly in hand to hand combat and dodging incoming fire. These are not lumbering beasts by any means.  
The overall artwork is nicely done, especially for the time frame in which it was released. There is, to my eye, a different aesthetic for anime artwork in the late '90's and early '00's. This title does not look nearly as dated as many from that same era, and the animation does not come across as overly dated.  
My one complaint about the art, and its completely personal, is that I do not like Kaname's hair color and eye color combo. I don't know why. I like everything else, but her blue hair and brown eyes just irk me most of the time. Not enough to take away from the enjoyment, but enough to make this old man grumble about it.  
Sound: 8 
The sound is good, the mechs sound metallic enough, with the appropriate crashes and rattles as they move about. The gunfire sounds aren't remarkable in and of themselves, but are completely serviceable. The voice actors are very well suited to each of their characters, and everyone sounds pretty much spot on. The captain of the submarine, who is around Kaname's age, does sound, at times, almost too innocent and young for the portrayal needed. 
The supporting cast voices are really well done also, with Kurz, Melissa, and the senior officers of the group all sounding awesome. In the case of Melissa and Kurz, they are most of the time very humorous as well.  
The background music is well done, has a bit of brass fanfare to it in places, big sounds, but that's fitting as we're dealing with huge battling mechs. The theme songs are a bit subdued for the kind of action and comedy presented, but still work fairly well. My big complaint with the music is that in the theme songs, about halfway or a touch more through the season, they keep the exact same soundtrack, but change the lyrics. Just about the time I get the words down well, they go and remix the lyrics! It's not an overly jarring change, at least in how it sounds, but I would have been happy if they would have just kept the one version of each song.  
Character: 7 
Sousuke is a great character, he's always business, or at least always seems to be serious, yet at times kind of seems to grasp a lighter view. He does move from being somewhat clumsy as a bodyguard in the beginning, coming very close to completely blowing the trio's cover more than once, but after a handful of episodes he get the swing of things, and while is still just as maniacal about Kaname's safety but acts in a much more convincing manner. This is very noticeable once the main villain takes the stage, and once this growth happens, he doesn't change too terribly much. We do see him falling for Kaname in littler things he does and says, but perhaps he's not even admitted his feelings to himself by the end of the season. This works well, his fairly static nature, as he's the straight man in the comedy setup. Not only that, once he really gets rolling, he's shown to be an utter badass of the highest degree. While he is only in his late teens to early twenties, his abilities with the mechs are so well honed that he's given the only mech that has the ultra powerful 'Lambda Drive' in it. He does have a bit of a tragic past, shown throughout the series. Overall, however, he remains a soldier trying to desperately complete his mission of guarding Kaname with little to no clue how to do it within his mission parameters.  
Kaname is just bubbly and fun, and while she does have her moments of getting into tight spots, she's not totally some damsel in distress. She's also actively involved a lot in her own rescue when she needs it, as her status as a Whispered somehow allows Sousuke to operate his mech's 'Lambda Drive' at a power level far beyond any other soldier in the outfit. She seems to be taken with him almost immediately after they are introduced, yet spends most of the season in denial, even after learning that she's a Whispered. She is a very tsundere character, and when the stress of the battle is over, she's quick to vent on Sousuke's head with whatever object is nearby. As all tsundere characters though, she does really come around and reach a point of caring deeply for Sousuke, not wanting him to leave when they believe the threat to her safety is over.  
The villain is an absolute beast, killing remorselessly and once he realizes who Sousuke is, develops a psychotic infatuation with him. At one point, when it appears both Sousuke and the villain are to die together, the villain even tells him he loves him. At first blush one might think, 'haha what a funny thing to say' but the villain delivers the line in such a menacing manner, touched with an almost eagerness to die that it's utterly creepy. He's a bad guy for the books, that one.  
The captain of the submarine that serves as the mercenaries' base of operations is, as I said, a young woman with a mysterious past of her own. She also becomes somewhat of a mild romantic foil for Kaname, developing feelings of her own for Sousuke. She's determined, sometimes naive, but has a good heart, and will do anything for her crew or to spare innocents. She's almost a touch overly goody-two-shoed, but just almost.  
Finally to round out the character set we have Kurz and Melissa, Sousuke's fellow mech pilots and operatives on the protection of Kaname. Kurz is a blonde playboy that tries to be smooth, and thinks every woman wants him, and Melissa is a hard-drinking, hard driving babe that makes sure Kurz knows that most decidedly not all or even most women want him. He's always playing loverboy, making passes at Kaname the few times they come into contact, and constantly ribbing Sousuke to 'move in' on her. Though he's a bit a pig when it comes to women, he's a reliable sniper and adept mech pilot who always steps up when the cards are played.  
Melissa is always throwing back a Budweiser and puffing a cigarette and giving Kurz a hard time. She's tough as nails and because she's the highest ranked among the three operatives, always leads by example. She fights hard, and she plays hard, and she's just one tough cookie! The only complaint I have about Melissa (who I otherwise love) is that she develops a very sudden case of competitiveness with the captain. This seems to come kind of out of nowhere, springing in suddenly one episode with little to indicate it was going to happen. She is the captain's polar opposite, so them not getting along perfectly makes sense, but it still hits as a little odd to go from only captain and crewman to prim and proper and loud and proud. It works, it's just a bit sudden when it starts.  
Enjoyment: 8 
Yeah, I know we're getting long again, aren't we? I can't help but talk about all the things I love, and I hope you guys, if any of you have read this far, can appreciate the passion I try to put into these pieces. So, FMP!, I did enjoy a good deal. I've actually seen season 1 a few different times, have used it as something to watch when I wasn't feeling up to keeping up with a new series. It's a fun little show with cool action and some really funny and great moments. Being someone who was a gamer in the '90's I nearly fell out of my chair the first time someone pulled out a Jane's magazine (they used to make *awesome* flight sims) and swung it around. There's several moments like this, some I know that went over my head in regards to weapons and tactics, but still, the overall experience is very satisfying.  
A note of caution however: watch the series in order if possible. Or at the very least do NOT watch Invisible Victory (the latest season) first. I actually prefer to watch season 1, then The Second Raid then Invisible Victory as they all have the same framework. I watch Fumoffu entirely separately usually after the Second Raid, as it's not really a 'mainline' entry, and deals mainly with only humorous elements and not any heavy plot takes. For example there is a whole episode dedicated to Kurz and a couple other guys trying to peek in on the captain, Melissa, and Kaname in a outdoor hotspring. Sousuke of course uses military grade non-lethal (paintballs, etc) equipment to keep the girls' virtues intact (well, as much as Melissa's can be salvaged at that point) complete with a VERY well placed rubber duck. So yeah, know that Fumoffu is the wacky spinoff, and don't start with the latest season, it'll mess it all up for ya. That wraps us up, feel free to throw me some love or hate, depending on how much your eyes are bleeding from this essay, I always love hearing from people. As for the great RTLR wall of mecha knife fights, the captain (Tessa) makes an appearance for Mithril and all of FMP! Two thumbs up!

    I had originally watched Full Metal Panic! (FMP) 5 years ago and at the time I had thought it was a nice watch.  Then during summer of 2007 I decided to rewatch FMP.  I had marathoned the series instead of watching only 2-3 episodes a day.  As I was watching I thought &ldquo;wow, was FMP this entertaining/fun to watch back then?&rdquo;  I guess the reason for this is because FMP is a fun show to watch, especially one to marathon.   
By &ldquo;fun&rdquo; this also means the anime is pretty light hearted and doesn&rsquo;t have too much complexity.  The story itself contains several plot holes, inconsistencies, and a flat villain.  What annoys me to no end is that FMP uses a few resets.  Ahh! wasted so much character development only to reset things.  However, it really isn&rsquo;t that noticeable until you start looking at it more deeply (ie not marathoning it&hellip;).  In addition, the structure of the series also lends to this marathonable nature.  The series is divided up into arcs, similar to anime with no predetermined episodes count.  Each of these arcs are pretty self contained, however this leads to pacing/flow problems.  First you have the start of one arc, a serious military story and once that&rsquo;s over you have light hearted high school comedy.  Next, you reset and repeat for the next arc.  Also, some episodes were simply out of place and really broke the flow of the series.  For example, the episode devoted to how Mao recruited Sousuke and Kurts.  For an anime series with no preset episode count, yes this can work, but not with one that&rsquo;s set for 24 episodes.  This can simply be due to the source material, a series of light novels.  Perhaps it could have been better if they had simply animated one arc per season.     
Most of the characters are pretty interesting and fun to watch.  This is part of what made the show for me.  I personally like the interaction between Chidori and Sousuke.  Not much else to say here, just remember to accept things like a 16 year old as a captain of a nuclear submarine and whatnot. 
As for the animation, Gonzo did a pretty good job and had very little inconsistencies.  In addition, the CG work was pretty nice as it blended in quite nicely.  Of course the action scenes did not disappoint.  The BGM was ok, nothing that really stood out for me.  Voices for both the Japanese and English had their strengths and weakness however, nothing really worth going into.  Hmm, actually, I was quite annoyed by Tessa&rsquo;s voice in the English.  Mamiko Noto as Shinji in the Japanese dub just didn&rsquo;t work for me, she still sounds like a girl.   
My only other complaint is with the very open nature of the ending.  What I mean by this is not the story is left unresolved it&rsquo;s the relationships between the character that left quite open.  However, there is a sequel, Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid done by Kyoto Animation and hopefully they will release another FMP soon.   
Despite all the flaws FMP remains a solid enjoyable watch without too much complexity.  It may appear as if I didn&rsquo;t like FMP, as I talked about many of the negatives but, taken as a whole I found it undeniably entertaining.  Just remember not to think too hard and you&rsquo;ll probably get plenty of enjoyment out of it as I had.

    Is Full Metal Panic! worthwhile? 
Is it fun? 
Should I watch it? 
Yes, definitely yes. 
Let me give a more detailed explanation as to why. A little less concrete, yet informative. 
See, Full Metal Panic! didn't have much to offer me. I don't like Mecha's too much, I enjoy watching them, but I don't like the genre most of the time. I don't like stories with a slow plot for a story that doesn't makes much logical sense (unless it is random comedy). But still, even though Full Metal Panic! could be considered both of these, Full Metal Panic! proved me wrong. 
It started off with more comedy and romance one could ask for; however, this was a positive thing. It was a build-up, a good one by that. It is a fair amount of episodes long; so it is expected to give us at least some development. The story was worthwhile and got me seated at the end of my seat. 
Despite having a not too creative concept; the whole thing was creative? 
Correct. The cast especially made me laugh 'that' many times on 'that' many occasions. This is one of those Anime you keep on watching one after one another, episodes after another until you realize it's way past the time to quit. Because it's that enjoyful.  
Screw not liking Mecha's, screw not liking a slow-plot. This Anime is awesome! 
That's what I thought. Mecha's don't appear too much, the plot isn't bad, just a little slow and predictable. Either way however, it's fun. 
It's like being a kid and being let to win by your mom, despite not being a retarded kid and knowing she set this up, you laugh and enjoy winning. This is one of those moments, just enjoy the card game even though the cards are played into your hands. 
I know I'm not making much sense now, but that's what Full Metal Panic! does to me. It's that awesome. If I could, I'd give it a 10+! 
But I can't. The story is so - so, the art is ok, nothing particularly bad, yet not exceptionally good. The characters are awesome, fun and quite interesting. The concept is also so - so. But overall I definitely enjoy this series. 
It also has a second and a third season; both being timidly themed a little different. The second season would tend more towards comedy, whilst the third season tends more towards romance, mecha and action. However, all three of them are great (including this one). 
The animation gets better in the third one; and the second season is definitely something unusual that makes you laugh out loud or giggle like a little schoolgirl (though, I hope that if your a guy you won't laugh like a li.. well, you get the point). 
So really, just watch this Anime, just watch the series. Sit back, relax, laugh and just have fun watching it. Even if you don't like it's genres, watch it! 
And if you do like it's genre's, well.. what're you waiting for! 
P.s: I actually liked the second and third season the most; those should have gotten a 9 from me if I would have written a review about them. Oh wait, I did write a review about those other two. Well, even more reason to check this entire series out. Have fun!

    Story: This anime is about a highly trained military commando/mecha pilot with no social skills named Sagara. He gets assigned to pose as a high school student to protect a large-breasted female student from being abducted by terrorists. As silly as the plot is, it creates room for interesting challenges. How will he blend in? How will he avoid suspicion? How will he protect this girl without blowing his cover? Etc. Well this anime chooses to brazenly ignore all of those concerns and have the Sagara act about as conspicuous as possible. It really requires that the audience suspend all disbelief. Example: What’s a normal reaction when you see a student holding a submachine gun on school grounds? Run? Warn the students? Call police? Nope. It’s to scold him playfully and then forget about it. Well that’s the way it works in this anime at least. It’s hard to build suspense when the audience isn’t sure what’s supposed to be taken seriously and what isn’t. 
However, if you decide to beat yourself over the head with a snow shovel until logic stops being important, FMP does become kind of endearing (it took 106 consecutive hits for me). The story has a lot of relationship/romance undertones which gives it quirky but cute feeling. Sagara is like a retarded Terminator sent to protect the prepiest and most volatile girl in school. It’s a recipe for a lot of odd and funny (often ecchi-related) misunderstandings. Over time, the audience gets to watch these characters interact and evolve…albeit very slowly. Unfortunately, they do tend to throw in useless arcs which distract from the overall plot and stall character development. I’ve read good things about the sequel so I watched S1 with that in mind. 
The action isn’t bad. There are some intense scenes that I think are pretty well done. At the same time, I finished the anime without a good sense of how the mecha worked, why certain (let’s call them mecha techniques) were used in some battles but not in others, how some characters managed to cheat death, and why the mecha insisted on fighting with little chode-like chainsaw daggers. To each his own but these were problems for me. 
Art: I’ve seen a lot better but it’s still pretty decent. I don’t have anything against it. 
Sound: Soundtrack wasn’t bad…they’re not going on my ipod but they weren’t bad.  
Characters: As much as I hated the simplicity and stupidity of the cast, it was that exact flaw that allowed this anime work. Instead of building a narrative based on complicated characters who have multiple layers, each character in FMP basically represents the extreme of a single, very simple concept. We as the audience get to see what happens when these extremes come together. It’s not pretty but it does get the job done.  
Sagara: He is essentially an Unsullied from Game of Thrones. No real personality, curiosity, sex drive, independent thought…nothing except an unwavering devotion to duty. Of course, one of the main conflicts in the series (evident from the TITLE of the first episode) is whether he is capable of forming human feelings and relationships. Narrative-wise, it’s not the worst place to start; it lets him be a blank slate. Who knows what sort new things he’ll learn and experience. Wouldn’t that be fun and sweet? Like watching cyborg Arnold bond w/ John Connor. The problem is that the pacing was off. I’ll say that in S1 his character evolution is generally plodding, erratic and subpar.  
Chidori: She was actually the most likeable character in my opinion despite being 100% anime cliché. Basically the chirpy, sassy hot girl who does the whole tsundere thing. I can think of half a dozen characters from other anime who have the same personality. As a main, she stands out only because she contrasts so heavily with Tessa…*sigh*.  
Tessa: She’s a 16 year old attack submarine captain in charge of most of the military operations. Maybe it’s a sign of watching too much anime but I’ve gotten completely used to seeing teens in super powerful military positions. The impossibility of it doesn’t even bother me anymore.  What did irritate me was her personality and the way she interacted with the other characters. It’s just really inconsistent. FMP wants to have a teen genius plan a military assault? No problem, L and Lelouch were awesome. But a crying, meek, swooning, scatterbrained little girl? That’s just pushing it for me. It also gave FMP a weird ecchi vibe…like they needed to insert a shapely female somewhere to hit a quota but didn’t know where to put her so BAM she’s the captain.  
Overall: Overall it was watchable. I am looking forward to S2 in hopes that it can pull things together more. 
Blood/Gore: Sagara actually shoots people lol. It’s a weird mix of goofy high school antics a violence.  
Love/Romance: It’s a little disappointing. I think it’s the love triangle dynamic. I’m still trying to figure out what the appeal of LTs are. School Days was the only one that made sense to me. In order to make them interesting or plausible the guy/girl being fought over has to be either really dumb/oblivious or extremely indecisive and douchey. I guess I’ll find out in S2. 
Sex/Nudity: non-nude shower scenes, panty thieves, unintentional awkward sexual situations…

    This will be a quick overview on this show. So ill give my general statements on it. A more detailed one may appear at some point in the future. I wont give a synopsis cause there's already one provided. Spoilers ahead so be warned. With that out of the way, grab a seat. let's have a chat.  
*Infinite Ryvius OST- nowhere plays* 
Full metal panic tries its best to mix an overarching militaristic plot with SOL comedy antics. However the later is a lot more poorly handled than the former. I will say this, it can potentially be a way for us to delve in the dysfunctional psychosis of our protag and also have him endear us to those around him, but not only are the jokes generally unfunny(only about two ever are) and are too big and overplayed to the point where it somewhat undermines his plight and also the lengths where this show wants you to take it seriously when it decides to not be grounded by reality. One minute its metal gear solid, the next Ranman 1/2. Couple that with the school cast being generally simplistic and cliche compared to the guys over at the Tuathe de Dana and you have a show that mostly has somewhat of an identity crisis. Which is especially disheartening seeing as how this is the shows MAIN SELLING POINT. It would be better if that stuff was a bit more downplayed, the jokes were more clever/subtle, and if it was coupled with clever dialogue to helps us get endeared to the characters in Sosuke's school life and how they impact his character, *inhale* but we got what we got. We'll come back to this later. 
Now with the SOL aspects out of the way, how does the plot stuff stack up? Pretty alright. Most of the ""arcs"" in the show have to do with the MC dealing with terrorists threats and keeping bitch queen Chidori safe almost episodically over the course of a few or more episodes each and they are pretty tense and high energy. They pretty much are the best parts of the show. In fact the third arc of the show is the one that gives us a good understanding of Sosukes identity and why he is the way he is better than the comedic shit does and puts him through certain struggles that make him develop as the show goes on. However the one flaw i see is that a couple of them are mostly rather pointless in terms of how they develop the characters creating somewhat of a pasing issue. But these are at least somewhat effective and largely inoffensive. 
*Gun X Sword OP* 
I am a simple man who loves his mech battles. While many of the fights in the show are mostly passable, i wouldnt lie to you if i say id rather see gundam F91 for its action than this(as much as i hate that movie). The animation is fine, but not detailed enough to give you the sense of battle most of the time and can be quite janky in certain places, making it seem like some corners were cut in the production value in the mech fights. Especially in times when the MC and villain uses the Lambda driver, showing mostly unmemorable particle effects. They dont really get better until the half way point, where startegy, use of environment and militaristic tactics are used. Not to mention generally better fight choreography. The designs of the characters and mechs arent bad though(my fave being the main mech Arbelest).  
Now we move to the characters and since i've already stated how the school side characters are practical pointless, uncharismatic and add nothing to our main duo, we'll move on to the guys that matter. 
*Big O OST- Sure promise plays* 
Sosuke Sagara is a boy who spent most of his life as a mercenary and knows practically nothing of domestic life, which causes him to have sporadic instances where he mistakes something normal for a time where he needs to ""YOOOOOOO JOE!"". This is the fundamental driving force for all his SOL antics, which i remind you is the least good part in the show for the reasons i stated above. I understand that those moments are design to showcase this aspect of his character and maybe have him go through a mid life crisis deal where he questions his own purpose and existence in life and if he can even be his own person let alone a force for good(a la Guts from berserk) and to be further enveloped by the new life he has made and the non combat experiences to creating a sort inner struggle within him. However his plight gets played too much for comedic effect and escalated a tad too much for us to take it seriously and since those moments barely advance his character at all, those moments are rendered pointless. When the show takes him out of the role of a highschool student, he might not become the most complex protag, but he's a lot more competent seeing as how he is in his element. Of course the fact that you become so comfortable within that state kinda goes against the general purpose of taking him out his comfort zone. And like i said, things do get revealed about in the later part of the show, which gives us an opportunity to show us whats in this G.I.jokes head. But the way he develops overall is mostly subpar and sporadic. He still has some moments that are pretty endearing despite how much of a socially inept straight faced hick he is. Just wished that showed off more often. 
 Now he does have a super special awesome mech (cause why wouldnt he) which has a hidden system that when activated can produce energy powered by Sosuke's will, and if your're wondering yes this does deus ex save his ass a couple times in the show. Of course Sosuke himself has a sort of love hate relationship with the machine that only works when it wants to. Kinda hard for someone as stiff as he is to rely on a machine that almost unscientifically powers you with your inner mojo, so he doesnt use it other than his important battles. He aint OP like Kira Yamato or nothing but it does make fights lack tension seeing as how all Sosuke needs to do is awaken his chakra G Gundam style and use shining finger. Overall Sosuke is an alright protag. 
*Undertale OST Dummy Gooseworx cover* 
Kaname Chidori ladies and gentleman. She's the main female lead of the show. A popular above average high school chick. She's the target for the terorists who want the secrets of super technology and psychic prowess in her head; as well as the target of my discomfort. She's basically every bratty teenage tsundere you can find in anime. Now admittedly i will say that her attitude towards our local MC is somewhat justified seeing as he somewhat is responsible for all the dumb shit happening around her and generally flipping her whole life upside down despite his aims to protect her from harm. This would be fine if the jokes were funny and... well you know the drill. So it kinda makes her come off as irritable at times. I get its only natural for her to be this way in this case but there are times in the show where its too overplayed and she makes outright dumb decisions where it does not justify her being a petulant cunt. She does use her hidden mcguffin powers to help the heroes and she does get a chance to understand sosuke better later on, including one charming scene in the last episode. Other than that, general personality isnt all that endearing and neither is her interactions/relationship with Sosuke. So yeah, this chick who looks like the descendent of Marth from Fire emblem is unlikable. Dabu Dee dabu die, bitch. 
*Nadesico OP* 
On to the characters who are a part of Mithral. Tessa is a pretty good supporting character. She's clumsy but still very charming. Despite her young age and demeanor she is a very effective captain of her group and made pretty sound decisions throughout the show(if you can ignore the probability of it). Other than that one pissing contest she had with another female character Mao in one episode, but it was mostly to have her understand the hardships and struggles her subordinates go through when they enter battle. She also has a crush on Sosuke (oooooh love triangle. Drama~) for actually understandable reasons. Given how somewhat of an awkward person she is and her environment and the fact that Sosuke is the only other person her age around, it would make sense for her to gravitate towards his military charm. She admires him for his strength and resilience which contrasts her own doubts about herself as well as the respect her crew gives her. And she doesnt come off as someone who exists soully for his sawed off shotgun, if you catch my drift. Plus she's a mcguffin like chidori so she's helpful in that area too. Which probably explains why she wouldnt have chidori put in a safe house somewhere under surveillance to keep her safe from the terrorists after her, cause she sympathizes with her plight to be a normal girl. Of course maybe sending Sosuke to protect her wasnt the best move. But overall she is a fun and effective character.  
Others like Kurtz and Mao are fine. Mao is the no nonsense valkyrie bitch who has some okay dialogue and Kurtz is the charming pervert with very little actual charm. They both act as sort of besties to Sosuke in his soldier life and are very useful throughout the show. They've done little to damage their characters, but not too much sticks out. they do have some funny moments though despite not really changing throughout this season of the series.  
*New Getter Robo OST- Deep Red* 
The main big bad is Garam and he is a pretty entertaining villain to a point. He is a constant threat throughout the show, rival and nemesis of Sosuke, and has some pretty endearing dialogue that lets him shine. He's kinda like Kenpachi Zaraki from Bleach but evil and in a mech. Also he acts as a parallel to Sosuke's identity, him being mad and battle hungry and Sosuke trying his best to appear as less of a savage like him despite his upbringing. Although the one thing i have an issue with him is that he always has a severe case of the not deads throughout the show and it only took the last ep for the heroes to finally ""kill"" him. The unstoppable killing machine angle can work but its too overdone here. Seeing the same guy die over and over mostly cause of the Lambda driver thing protecting him is kinda tiring to see. If he had only appeared in two arcs in the story preferable the first and last , he wouldve been much better handled and his final fall would have more impact. But he is entertaining and formidable villain throughout the show overall. 
So overall Full metal Panic season 1 is an alright semi-real mecha show that is kinda bogged down by its main gimmick that being its SOL aspects and occasional fanservice. If the show managed to integrate both of these aspects seamlessly it wouldve improve a lot and there wouldnt be near constant tonal whiplash. But the action is okay, plot inoffensive, and has a few likable characters. So I'd recommend it. 
If you liked this review, ill be making one for Second Raid soon. Its been cool. Kaiser Shounen, LAUNCH!

    Okay. The following is a review I did ages ago, for another website. But I wrote it so here it is. Don't bitch if you think it's shit.  
Plot Summary: Based on the Japanese Novels of the same name, Full Metal Panic! is a series set around Souske Sagara, a member of the Anit-Terrorist Organisation 'Mithril', and Kaname Chidori. Souske's mission is to act as a bodygaurd to Ms. Chidori by becoming a fellow High School student. 
Review 
Storyline: The story line towards the beginning relies on alot more of a comedic approach but quickly shocks you away with Terrorist Hijackings, Mecha battles and deep details of characters pasts. There was only one real 'Side-Story' which really didnt need to be there and wasnt much fun as they tried to break up action between one story arc and another. After this minor setback, the story flows completely and you will find your Playlist will be full of FMP. 
Characters: The characters have depth, from Souske's deep teenage military past to Kaname's secrets. Souske is usually a complete dumbass when it comes to teenage life and its his mistakes that make the show funny, with the sugar being Kaname's reactions, sometimes with a dreaded Paper Fan. Kaname is more headstrong and smart, and her Love/Hate relationship with Souske is like one massive tub of Marmite. 
Animation: The animation is some of the best in recent years, definately one of my favourites. Both character and mecha designs fit well into the series. 
Voice Acting: Awesome. I liked the VA-ing so much when I watched episode 1 dubbed, I hunted everywhere for the series dubbed. It was definately worth the time as it has one of the best casts. I wouldnt expect any less from ADV. 
Ending: Climactic battle between arch enemies both piloting Arm-Slaves(The Mecha of the Anime).Oh, so thats what Kaname can do stuff. Guy gets the girl.....kinda. Definately leaves you wanting more. Good job theres a few sequals then. 
Conclusion:This series had hype, and I follow the hype, damn good thing too. The anime will always be close to me as a fav, I started off thinking it would be a nice relaxing comedy for me and boom, I get hit with all these storylines from no-where. Great anime.

    This is going to be my first review, but bear with me. You're in for a treat. 
Story: (9) For the story, I'd say originality is a key term for FMP. It is a brilliant, well layed out plot and to say that it's nearly perfect is an understatement! 
 The story goes about a  young, yet skillful 17 year-old MITHRIL sergeant, Sousuke Sagara. In his bare nature, he is  military-obsessed and also clueless of normal civilian conduct. As a sergeant under command of the military, Sousuke is instructed to look after and protect Ms. Kaname Chidori. Kaname, for one, is very unique. As one would prejudge that she would be a timid, typical school girl, she can be almost the exact opposite. Kaname is clever, daring and also very beautiful, but what you don't expect is her impulsive and slightly obnoxious personality. 
As part of Sousuke's mission, he is to relocate and transfer into the same school and class as Kaname. This is when the series takes off to be more enjoyable. 
As i've mentioned, Sousuke is military obsessed and does not take his job lightly. So you can see how what conflicts are being set out; both internal and external and to a great extent, often humorous. (: 
BUT, being the great anime that it is, that is not all that goes on. I will not disclose this information, but I can tell you that BIG things will happen (quite literally aswell) and you will be glad that you've watched this anime. 
____________________________________________________________ 
Art/Animation: (10) The animation quality of this anime is quite a looker! I mean the animation is astounding! Vast, vibrant colors with perfect saturation. I know there has to be some CG animation in this series, though I really don't remember seeing it. Know why? Because the CG is so perfectly blended with the animation! (; All in all, this is some Top-Shelf animation. 
Sound: (9) To be honest, the opening song, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is one of my favorite tracks of any anime soundtrack. It is a very nice Japanese-Rock and the voice is just beautiful! As for the sound in the series, like the animation, it just does wonders. Both the Japanese and English audio are incomparable, and if you're an English dub kind of person, the voice acting for english is very well acted and the sound quality is at it's finest. (unlike some emotionless dubbing I've heard) boom. Top-Shelf audio. All I can say. 
Character: (10) When you have a good anime, you have a good cast of characters aswell. I can credibly say that there is outstanding character development throughout the series (which can prepare you for the next series) You will definitely 'feel' for all the characters in the series even if they're just supporting. I strongly believe that you will enjoy and accept the characters. (except for the bad guys, duh.) boom. Top-Shelf cast. 
Enjoyment: (10) As for the enjoyment, I GUARANTEE you will absolutely enjoy this series. This is one of those series that you just can't go wrong with. It's story, art, sound, and cast is just so perfect. I certainly enjoyed watching every second of Full Metal Panic. I STRONGLY recommend you watch this series. For people who don't watch anime, I'd say FMP is the best start. After completing this series, all the other anime will just seem sub-par. Again, you will definitely enjoy this anime to it's fullest potential. 
_____________________________________________________________ 
Full Metal Panic is ultimately my favorite anime of all time. Why you ask? Well in my personal opinion, I'd say that FMP is a masterpiece that has integrated a vast variety of genres into one. It has aspecs of Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Mecha, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Military, a little Romance, and a hint of Ecchi! What is not to like about this series? Again, this is my first time submitting a review and I am certainly glad that I have started with Full Metal Panic!

    Full Metal Panic is a pulpy Cold-War era story that has been run through the Anime-machine. From the cold-war story side we get conspiracies to start World War 3 involving Soviet scum with gloriously evil villains and high-tech weaponry fighting guerilla warfare. From the anime side we get the heroes not being pumped full of testosterone faultlessly nationalistic Americans, but instead a teenage boy and a paramilitary force with terrible CG submarines captained by a cute teenage girl. Also giant robots. Because there is not a single story than cannot be improved with the addition of giant robots. 
Full Metal Panic has to win some kind of award for having its main character, Sagara Sousuke, come from Afghanistan. I know they say Sagara is from the non-existent Helmajistan, but let’s not kid ourselves. That’s just so the author could avoid having to deal with real politics in his nonsense cold war story. He’s got darker skin than the Japanese and had a really shitty childhood torn apart by war which he’s only been able to get over by immersing himself so much in military knowledge and protocol. When you take a step back and think about it for a second, that’s kind of crazy that this dumb anime had the balls to cast such an unconventional protagonist. 
Sagara’s military-obsession is usually played for jokes, and it does get a bit tiring. Well, the tiring parts are mostly Chidori’s reactions. Sagara is so straight faced and meticulous about the way he pulls off these actions that it still cracked me up, much more so when the show made nothing of it. It’s such simple things too, like snapping his feet together when addressing someone new. It’s like they had a laundry list of things Sagara must do at all times to ensure they keep this image. Whenever Sagara enters a room, his eyes must dart to the four corners. Whenever he’s got over his initial introduction, he must stick his hands behind his back in his ‘at ease’ pose. 
It’s because they keep up this image of Sagara in the dumb school segments that it’s really damn cool when he’s called into actual proper military action. What makes it satisfying is that, through his actions earlier on in the show, we know he’s competent but just not in this environment despite him clearly trying his hardest. I’m half tempted to call it moe, but it’s not quite that. You want to root for him when he’s sucking, and you get that emotional release when he’s finally put into a situation where he can be awesome. It’s a different sort of play on the emotional satisfaction you get from watching someone kick ass after going through training. The bonus here is that the non-awesome parts are still charming and funny in their goofy anime way. 
Tessa plays to this strength too. Her shtick is that she’s frail and clumsy physically, but she’s a tactical genius and military expert. The way they play into this is kinda neat too, because they tease us with the idea of how the hell could this moeblob command the highest technologically advanced submarine full of buff macho military dudes when she’s so outwardly useless? They particularly play into this when, in her first real scene with Sagara, she deliberately plays to dunce in front of Kaname because she knows this will get on Sagara’s nerves. 
Tessa’s story, or more accurately the slow reveal of her competence, is the secret best thing FMP does. Through the course of the show you slowly start to understand why it is she is able to command that submarine. The moral guardian, strong will, hard work, tactical genius and a whole load of various other strengths she has come to the fore so that by the end you totally understand why everyone listens to her. It’s a strange sort of command, where you get the feeling people follow her orders because they don’t want to let her down. But it works. I know that if I was on that sub and I was called into her office for not following orders and she had that hurt look on her face, I would be devastated and vow never to let her down again. 
But anyway, Tessa is a badass and I weep for those of you who consider Kaname a better character. 
I think the moment that sealed my dislike of Kaname was when Sagara was doing his first badass military action hero shtick. He dashed in and rescued Kaname from the research facility, only for Kaname to then yell “eeewww you pervert get away from me”. It’s not necessarily Kaname’s character that makes her bad, although she is a pretty boring person. It’s how the show treats her as well. 
Like pantyshots. Full Metal Panic is in many ways a product of its time, and much of the shit it pulls that I don’t like are outdated anime tropes. Random upskirt pantyshots in otherwise serious scenes of generally serious anime appear to have gone from anime nowadays, and thank christ for that. The most egregious example is when Kaname is going through a mental breakdown, and they decide to have a little peep up her skirt. Great, because that’s really the time I feel like perving out over a girl. When she’s going through a mental breakdown. Tessa gets treated to this perv-cam sometimes too, albeit mostly just caressing her legs. With Kaname though, it seemed to be in perv mode the entire time. 
Speaking of dumb shit that’s finally outdated, abusive girlfriends punching their men because it’s so funny when the violence is reversed! The it’s never funny because the joke is entirely Kaname hitting Sagara. It doesn’t evolve as a gag. We’re just expected to laugh because she hit him. It’s not going to evolve either because Kaname doesn’t have much of a personality to speak of. She is Ordinary High School Student Mark 591245. You can tell she’s a boring person because any scene with Sagara not around simply consists of her talking about TV and shopping and homework and tests and every other thing boring teenagers talk about. 
Her saving grace is that her relationship with Sagara is genuinely charming. Their relationship is used to different effects through the show. Sometimes it’s about establishing trust, or how Sagara has grown to care for a person. The strangest, and I’d argue most surprisingly effective use was the surprisingly dark and gritty trio of episodes where Sagara goes back to his home country of Afgani-I mean Helmajistan. While they’re excellent episodes, they’re so tonally different from the rest of the series that it barely feels like the same anime. But how it draws attention to that is quite marvellous too, using the almost alien calmness of Sagara’s return to Kaname as a really effective bookend to the harshness of that arc. 
I was not expecting Full Metal Panic to hold up, but it turns out I still love Full Metal Panic. It’s got its problems, almost all of them centring on Kaname, and I’ll whole-heartedly admit that it is totally My Kind of Anime, but it does what it sets out to do really well. It’s a huge amount of fun with great characters and giant robots. 
Also, to re-iterate, Tessa >>>>>>>> Kaname.

    After finishing season 1 of Full Metal Panic I can safely say that it makes me want to watch Fumoffu a lot more. 
The first three or so episodes do a fantastic job introducing you into this world that's a mix between a high-school comedy and a military-mecha setting. It's really entertaining and I was looking forward to seeing more of it. 
Sadly, after that initial arc the show begins to lean far more heavily into its military-mecha half, and the comedy all but dissipates.  
Two out of the four featured ""serious"" arcs bored the hell out of me. The entire time I was watching them I felt like I'd seen their exact scenarios played out in countless other military-dramas and thrillers. Thankfully there are two serious arcs that were actually enjoyable and kept me invested in the action. The only issue is that they were placed on opposite ends of the series, leading this deep sag in the middle of the show. 
I also had issues with Chidori as the main female lead. Her comedic chemistry with Sagara was great to see, however I didn't like what the show did with her during its more serious story-arcs. Her personality seemed inconsistent during these parts, like it was getting constantly tweaked to fit whatever situation the show needed her to be in. She was hard to get a read on, especially when her psychic-link persona kicks in and she becomes a different person entirely. 
Sagara on the other hand is really consistent as a character. He works remarkably well in a comedic role due to his fish-out-of-water nature as a military-pro attending high school. The only problem with his consistency is that during the serious moments he just feels like your standard military-action protagonist. He's not that interesting for most of the show, as it takes a while before he starts showing cracks in his battle-hardened persona. 
Connected to Sagara is the main villain who I honestly have very little to say about. He's just a bit of a slimy jerk who makes the same smug face the entire show. Not at all interesting, and I didn't care for him as the main villain. 
On the technical front the show's animation is alright, just not the most exciting to look at. There are some aspects that have not aged well at all, be it some of the early 2000's anime style quirks, or the CG vehicles. There are some moments of pretty solid action choreography but it was never enough to blow me away. 
Most of what kept me going was Sagara as a lead character. He worked amazingly well during his comedic bits, and he was likeable enough when the action started going down. It's a shame that the comedy got worse (and less prevalent) as the season went on, as it's what I was sticking around to see more of. 
Despite all of these issues I still come away from Full Metal Panic feeling like giving it a strong 5 to a mild 6. It's certainly above average in some regards, and it at least ended on a high-note, however I doubt I'll ever want to rewatch it.

    Interesting trivia: FMP can be viewed as a huge tribute to Neongenesis EVA as even the main characters are inspired by it. 
Kaname has a feisty spirit of the German Vixen Asuka Langley. 
Mellisa Mao is a straight up copy of a Misato and even a voice actress is the same. Shinji (Sagara's nerdy classmate) is light touch on Shinji himself with a bit of sanity and a phenis control. They are both motherless with a ... less than ideal father.   
Kurz Weber is rather similar to Kaji Ryuji not only in looks and character, but in their desires for Mellisa / Misato and other ladies. 
Love this anime to bits, especially given it was my gateway to anime world.

    The first compilation review of the HTWA! Hope you find it handy! 
""Haha, first to dis this anime :P. It's popular because it has hit US airwaves, other than that I don't know why it's popular. It was mostly boring for me, hated how they had to fight the same guy 4+ times to kill him, and I really hated the Lamda Driver thing, because I don't think something so unrealistic should be in this kind of mecha anime. I did like the characters, animation, and the romance however. Because I know this lamda (whatever) driver is in the next season, I'm not watching any more seasons of this."" - aoikishu 
""Of the three installments I like Fumoffu best, followed by TSR... probably because Fumoffu hardly has any mecha in it. What makes it popular, I have no idea. But what I like in it is surely Sousuke. Gotta love him for his uh... n00bishness. IMO he's a pretty unique character, and he has good a background too. Not a fan of moe so I kinda don't like Tessa. I prefer Chidori, but sometimes she gets on my nerves too. Generic tsundere. Of all the mecha animes I've watched I prefer this the most. It's light on encyclopedic terms and I pretty much understand what's going on when they fight. The whole Whispered stuff is so-so. Also seconding what aoi said about the Lamda Driver(?). I think it's a good anime for beginners to watch. Also, never heard of any rumors regarding a third season, but my fingers are crossed xD"" - Wetpantsu 
""I thought it was ok, Fumoffu is definitely better than the first season, I haven't seen TSR though, I'm just not really that bothered to watch it atm. I also don't like Chidori that much, I don't really like Tsundere characters in general :/"" - saintcross 
""lol, tessa > chidori by a ton. Chidori is really tsundere, even more so than kugimiya rie characters and that's saying something. You really can't beat the onsen episode in fumoffu though. That was the funniest and most original onsen scene ever. It's really the standard I compare any onsen episode to but none ever live up to it."" - tigerz 
""I think that's why I had a problem with the show during my first watch of it. I REALLY wanted a military/mecha show & couldn't care less about the romanctic comedy aspect. I've gotten used to the combination after rewatches. But I prefer Fumoffu because it focused well on comedy & the TSR because it did an outstanding job on the military/mecha aspect. 
It has one of my favorite story arcs though, & that's when he goes back to his country of origin & eventhough it was a disaster & very grim it was some of the best anime I've ever watched. 
OH & yeah, TESSA RULZ!!"" - DonKangolJones 
""Personally, the first season was my favorite. I dropped Fumoffu because I'm not into romcom (or just plain comedy). I liked the mixture of high school life with mecha/military in the first. I prefer anime that have a mixture of different genres: romance, comedy, suspense, mecha... the first season did the best handling different aspects. I love how the first ended as well, just some sweet hanging out time fishing. 
TSR was... mreh, boring. I don't know why I wasn't all that interested in it, but I wasn't. Maybe I just liked how the first season ended and seeing any more was just unnecessary. 
Chidori was my favorite character. I love both Tessa and Chidori, but Chidori was definitely my favorite. I like how well she handled scary and dangerous situations even though she had no military background. The backbone that both of the girls have are what I admire."" - willag 
""Full Metal Panic series is one of my favorites and I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. Yeah, I said that there was a rumor about a 3rd season but I forgot where I read that so it's probably not even true. 
Anyway, 1st season had a good story to it whereas the 3rd season had probably more action in it. My favorite is probably the 2nd sesason Fumoffu since it's takes the characters we all know and love and puts them into a different kind of anime. Plus, it's one of the funniest comedies I've seen. I can go back and laugh my ass off every time I watch it, it's that funny =D."" - shoxk 
We hope you have enjoyed reading through the opinions of your fellow MAL peers! ^^

    Full Metal Panic! 
Another anime that let me down, i had high expectations towards this anime because how well praised is, and from the beginning to the end this was just fine but not what they say it is. 
The setting of the anime is kinda interesting, the problem is that is not well developed and not to mention that the bland characters didn't help at all, with an annoying MC Chidori Kaname who has constant angry problems that comes out of nowhere, and her mood doesn't make sense, why bitch to the person is trying to protect you, and she acts like if he doesn't have a military job, poor Sousuke, he's sent to protect her because she is somehow special she's a ''Whispered'' and they explain a little what they are, but not what we want to know and they didn't explain how and why they exist, a lot of unexplained topics and the problem of the why wasn't explained is that there are a lot of filler boring eps, a lot of inconsistencies are found in this anime and again Kaname is really annoying, i hate that kind of characters, i like tsunderes but to the extent of being stupids, no thanks; There's a guy also, Gaul (whose reason of being a bad guys isn't explained) he's hard to kill even when he explodes, it's stupid how he always survive without any hint on to how he did it, i don't know why people are saying this is romcom, i don't see the romance in here, an attempt, yes but i don't get why people say they liked that aspect of the anime, makes no sense. The story is ok but not well presented. 
Art & Animation 
The animation sometimes can be good, but it has something that i didn't like, and i don't know what it is, the mouth and sound sync was weird, almost all of the time there were weird camara angles and unrelated shots for example when Sagara was fighting other AS mechas and all of a sudden shots of Chidori in the beach (?) but i think overall is ok. 
The VA is good but sometimes sounds bad, maybe because of the animation of the mouths being looped to do the same movement, the OP is bad and skippable just like the ED and the background music wasn't fitting at the beginning but after 10 eps. it gets a little better and good and to mention that one song reminded me of an A-Team song, overall it was fine. 
Most of the characters you don't care if they could be taken away from the anime and never appear again, because you won't miss them. 
-Chidori Kaname is a meh character at the beginning but with her attitude becomes a bad one, she is useless and doesn't stop to be angry at Sousuke for some reason; She all of a sudden gets angry or gets angry at stupid reasons and even gets angry at him just because he's working on a mission where people die and that affects him but she doesn't ask him how he feels rather than that she gets mad at him, she doesn't have a background of any kind, what a bad character. 
-Sousuke (Isegar) Sagara is a person that doesn't have social skills and that can be conflictive most of the times, but he's like that because he's a soldier since he was a kid, he has little background, just flashbacks; He's a good character but nothing amazing, i liked that he finally got angry at Chidori and somehow at the end he had more social skills. 
-Tessa Testarossa is a sweet girl that wants to save everyone and she in fact is the captain of Mithril or was it just the Ship with the weird name? i don't remember, i liked her more than Chidori who in fact falls in love with Sousuke too and is more open than Chidori about it. 
Then there's the rest of the cast that are meh, nothing special worth the mention, i thought the characters were ok jus for Sousuke and the Cap. Tessa. 
There were good eps. that i enjoyed but the enjoyment was just fine for me, i wanted to finish the anime already, too much eps. and no explanations.

    ""SOUSUKE!""  
""Oh, Chidori, I was just-"" 
*Fan slap* 
What do you get when you mix a stolid, obedient, loyal, emotionless killing machine with an average, popular, high school girl? HILARITY. Absolute hysterics, rolling on the floor laughing at the insanity of such a crazy combination of weird characters. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this odd mix of personalities. 
Sagara Sousuke, a merciless killer and professional guerilla soldier, finds himself in the worse situation possible: protection of a high school girl in a civilian life he has never lived. His emotions, frayed and destroyed from constant warfare since childhood, are nonexistant- until he meets Chidori, that is. The story ranges from the unique bond that develops between these two characters, the hilarity of their conversations, and the seriousness of high school romance sprinkled with drama and a military background.  
Character development was rather static; though things tended to happen and the characters realized something, I think the developers of the anime knew they were making a second season, so the first season was sort of a prequel, a taste of what was to come. They wanted this season to be sort of a teaser of what really is to come. 
I originally did not think this would be a very good story. The idea was far-fetched as it is! But Full Metal Panic left me wanting more and more, endlessly ceasing to surprise me with a convenient plot twist or a brief moment of humor. It was a pleasant anime, one with the ""good guys"" always win sort of macho attitude, but it was rather surprising, because the plot advanced rapidly once certain key events happened. 
Overall, I did enjoy watching this little anime even though it's rather old. I liked how the characters personalities tended to clash, but when they meshed, a new sort of storyline emerged, one that you knew would be continued in the sequel. And though I initially had my reservations, I loved this little anime, and I heavily recommend it. Remember, the Tuath De Dannan needs you!

    Introduction 
Full Metal Panic doesn't do anything new, it just does everything better 
A lot of mechas alternate between school and action trying to be two different animes at once but were always lacking in one respect.  Full Metal Panic is the exception.  True, the young Sergeant moonlighting between school and working as a mercenary seems cliche at first, but there's something different about Sousuke and his personality that makes him interesting as a fighter as well as a student.  Full Metal Panic does the best job of balancing the two so it never feels like the school episodes are fillers but are necessary and entertaining.   
Story 8/10 
Straightforward, easy watching action comedy but has a good balance of suspense and fun. 
The story is simple and straightforward.  A young sergeant becomes the bodyguard of an important high school girl while also piloting the most advanced mech unit for a secret mercenary organization whose mission is to stop terrorism.  The story never tries to extend itself so far as to explore the philosophy of life or the human condition.  There are various devices used such as the secret advanced technology called &quot;Black Technology&quot; and a group of natural born geniuses called &quot;Whispered&quot; that exist merely to move the original plot along.  
Unfortunately, for those hoping for a series like Code Geass where there are many twists and turns, they may become disappointed.  However, the series does become more intense and more secrets are revealed during The Second Raid.  The current series, however, focuses purely on entertainment.   
So what makes this anime so good?  It's the style.  The pacing of the anime is fast during the action sequences and slower and more mellow during the school sequences.  The transitions between civilian life and military battles are seemless. They come at appropriate times and contrast well with each other.  Sometimes the contrast is done so perfectly that it can be considered artistic.  For example, in one scene, during a heated battle the camera pans on Sousuke's look of intensity during battle and then flashes back to the quiet and relaxing beach with Chidori looking off in the distance as if she could see a wonderful future with Sousuke.  Scenes like that vividly and subtley communicate the thoughts of each character without verbal expression. 
In terms of action sequences, the series is good but not spectacular. The main problem is that some action sequences end very abruptly.  The battle ensues for quite awhile but then at the last second they pull out their ultimate move (Lamda Driver) and it ends 5 seconds later when one person is left standing.   
Despite that, I think the action sequences are still entertaining to watch because of its simplistic nature.  The battle strategy is not as elaborate and mental as they are in animes like Code Geass and the fight scenes aren't complicated with a lot of special power moves.  Instead, the action relies on Sousuke's decision making abilities and superior combat reflexes to win each battle as well as Kurtz Weber's accurate sniping ability.  Both are legitimate abilities that are not only entertaining but are a solid basis for determining the outcome of each battle. 
Characters 8/10 
Simple but likable and entertaining. 
Sousuke Sagara looks like your typical strong, justice-seeking shounen lead.  He is simple, straightforward, honest, and courageous and during action sequences he reminds you of characters like Ichigo Kurosaki. However, something strange happens when you take a typical shounen character and place him in everyday situations without changing his tone and personality.  Where his strengths were once desired, they become cumbersome and akward, and all that was once typical about his character dissipates in the cheerful, relaxed environments. He become's like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Kindergarden Cop.  His do-or-die, everywhere is a battlefield personality conflicts with a normal person's perspective of common sense.  This makes Sousuke's serious personality the butt of most of the jokes and one of the most entertaining characters to watch.   
Opposite to Sousuke, Kaname Chidori is a typical, strong tsundere character whose main target of aggression is Sousuke Sagara.  Most comedic moments stem from Sousuke's mistakes and Chidori correcting him, sometimes with a harisen.  Fans of tsunderes such as any of the characters played by Kugimiya Rie will love Chidori.  I'm not a tsundere fan myself, but I found Kaname Chidori's character be tolerable since she is somewhat more open and obvious with her affection towards Sousuke.   
Fortunately or unfortunately, this anime lacks characters who overcome grave character flaws such as weakness and arrogance.  If you are looking for character development similar to Neon Genesis Evangelion then you will not be happy with Full Metal Panic.  Full Metal Panic tries its best to make characters likable and strong from the beginning to the end.  This lack of depth and development may make the anime less realistic for some, but in terms of entertainment the characters leave nothing more to be desired. 
Animation/Art 7/10 
Good art and animation from that time period but nothing ground-breaking. 
My view towards mecha is that once you've seen one, you've seen them all so I may not be the best judge when it comes to judging how cool the designs are.  That being said, I've always felt that the fact that Gauron's mecha had hair was a bit odd and out of place and that the Arbalest looked very similar to the other M9s and wasn't distinguished enough as a special unit.  However, I must say that they definitely look better than the mecha from animes like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann since they are more professional and more realistic.   
The use of CGI was well integrated and I didn't feel like they went overboard which seems to be a common problem with Mecha animes such as the other Gonzo mecha series Kurogane no Linebarrels. 
As for the characters, they seem to have a little old fashion style to them indicative to anime from the 90s and early 2000s but I enjoy the fact that their proportions are realistic.  The men aren't too bulky and muscular while there aren't any women with unrealistically big breasts.  In addition, they vary a lot of the facial features for the men such as eyes and bone structure so most characters differ by more than just hair color.  However, if you take away the hair, most of the women look exactly the same. 
Sound 9/10 
Great utilization of music and talented voice actors enhance the realism and accurately portray each mood. 
The background music for the action and suspense sequences are chosen well and timed to perfection.  I couldn't help but think that if John Williams was doing background music for anime, it would be similar to instrumental background music used in Full Metal Panic.  Great use of brass crescendos to build the suspense but even more important was their use of pauses and silence right before an explosion to create the added tension during crucial moments during battle.   
I was a big fan of the OP music.  Mikuni Shimokawa has such a soothing and beautiful voice and does the theme song for all three Full Metal Panic series. In addition, they synchronized it with the animation very well.   
The voice acting cast does a good job of portraying the characters accurately.  Masahiko Tanaka's voice is very suited for villains like Gauron with his deep voice and sinster laugh.  Also, Tomokazu Seki does a great job of making a character like Sousuke believable and amiable.  As for Chidori, Satsuki Yukino does a great job utilizing her vocal range to express every bit of emotion expressed in her character's face.  She really feels alive and three dimensional rather than just a stereotypical tsundere. 
Enjoyment 10/10 
It has a certain charm that you can't find anywhere else. 
Full Metal Panic is a series that draws you into its pace and never gives you the feeling that it drags on too long or ends too quickly.  Instead, it keeps pushing forward every episode so there is always something exciting to look forward to at every turn.  In terms of comedy, this series is the best of the mecha genre and perhaps one of the best comedies ever.  The laughs were neither cheap nor overplayed but felt fresh and unique to the series itself.  In addition, they were neither hard to comprehend nor overly reliant on obscure parodies. Most of the comedy stems from Sousuke and his lack of common sense but oddly enough you never get tired of this scenario since it seems to be unique to the series itself.  Whenever I am laughing at Sousuke, I always feel more like I am laughing with him than at him, and this makes all the difference since male leads need to seem reliable during serious moments.   
Conclusion 9/10 
If you like mecha action and comedy and aren't looking for something thought-provoking and ground breaking then Full Metal Panic provides just the right amount of pure entertainment value.

      I began watching this anime after reading a lot of very positive reviews on the internet, with many people saying it's one of their favourite anime of all time. But none of these reviews was  well-argued, now I understand why. 
Story: 3/10 
  That is the only good-point of the anime: Full Metal Panic have a story that is not original, but it have the merits of permitting to have both action and humor, and why not an thrilling fight for the sake of the world. But up to episode 15, i saw none of these. 
 The very firt episodes were okay, but rapidly the jokes began to be less and less funny, and I started to notice that the author(s) did not knew what to do with this anime and more important were incapable of writing a story that is coherent. The story soon became ridiculous, with the mysterious power of Kaname which serves no purpose (at least in the 15 first episodes), the MITHRIL organisation that have no reason of existing, is not associated with any country and which financing seemed to be popping out of the void, and there is A LOT of things like theses... 
  Each episode is filled with blatant incoherences, but the worst is the characters and organisations that never act realistically. As an instance we have the militaries who in an episode are told to obey Sousuke because they face an ennemy (Gauron) that nobody but Sousuke can compare with in fighting skills and who is well-known by the latter. But these militaries, who are supposed to be well-trained professionals and even veteran warriors don't give a shit about their superiors orders and don't seem to have the minimum of intelligence required to know that on a battlefield you don't fucking do what you want, because it can make you and your comrades killed. They don't listen to Sousuke's advices and they go all-out on Gauron and his henchmans, i think Gauron then beat the crap out of them but I'm not very sure because I saw this anime quite some time ago. 
  This lead me to another very bad aspect of this show: the characters. 
Characters: 3/10 
  Again, there is no character that his credible in this show. We are told a lot of things about these characters but we never see these affirmations being confirmed by the facts. 
  For instance Sousuke and Teletha are supposed to be respectively a skilled and experience warrior and a genious, but they are just two brainless idiots. I understand that it can be used fo comic situations, but for me it was just impossible to appreciate this show with so enormous incoherences. For instance, in the episode where Kanade and Teletha are taken hostages and snipers are aiming their rifles at them, the so-called professional soldier make the worst choice possible 
  Kanade is as bad-written as the others, it's like the author read the definition of ""tsundere"" on the japanese wikipedia and decided to do a character like that, her mood swings are never explained neither justificated. 
  All the characters are like living and breathing robots, with no personnality, the voice actors (in the japanese dub) don't help, with Satsuki Yukino more shouting than acting and Tomokazu Seki who put in his acting as much emotion as a brainless zombie. 
  Secondary characters are no better, like Melissa and Curz whom I thought at first could be quite funny and likable are finally totally useless and irritating. 
Art: 2/10 
 As expected from Gonzo, it's absolutely horrible, it's really hard to watch, the backgrounds are empty, the animation is poor, the characters move jerkily, the 3D and the colourisation are of very bad taste. I thought I was looking at a early-90's (or late 80's) anime show. Too bad that Gonzo animation quality started improving in the late 2000's with Saki and Strike Witches, just a moment before the studio dissapeared. 
Sound: 5/10 
  Absolutely not good, not truly bad, I just didn't notice the music most of the time and at times I found it even a little irritating. The opening was also quite bad, both the song and images seemed to be taken from some cheap bishoujo game. 
Enjoyment: 3/10 
  Beside the first episode, it was really boring, and every episode I was wondering how is it even possible to make a show that is so crappy. I watched up to episode 15 out of curiosity for this anime which was so acclaimed by many people, and hoping that the quality will improve, that the show will suddenly become interesting and funny, bu it didn't happened. And I'm amazed I made it this far. I think in fact that after I had watched some episodes, I was just watching it for the lulz, like when you watch a very bad movie. 
Overall: 3/10 
  I think at Full Metal Panic as one of the worst anime I have ever watched, there is no redeeming feature for this show. At the contrary of, for instance, Lost Universe, which is bad but where there is good voice actors ( Megumi Hayashibara!), some quite funny episodes, and charming characters. 
Also, sorry for the poor english, I'm not a native speaker, I'm french and it's currently 3 am in France, so I'm tired and I have difficulties reading over my text.

    ""Full Metal Panic"" and its sequels are a couple of my friends' favourite anime. But to be perfectly honest, I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Although the presentation is pretty shiny (it's GONZO after all), and the execution competent, for me, this is mostly just a bog standard action anime with some comedy moments (only some of which are funny) and some nice gripping scenes sprinkled over it. But the key word there is ""mostly""... and more on this later. 
You've probably seen the type before. You have a military organisation, and they go on the various missions, always running into this seemingly unkillable boomerang of a bad guy who happens to be a bit insane and wants to destroy the world or something. At the end of the show, you get the obligatory final show down between the hero and that insane villain. Most of these missions are enjoyable at the time of watching, but ultimately forgettable (in fact I have actually forgotten them), but one does stick out. It's where they go on a desert mission that takes place in the the main character Sagara Sousuke's homeland. The internal conflicts within the mission team and Sousuke's meeting with an old acquaintance managed to spice up the flavour quite a bit and put that extra edge of tension as well as emotion onto the story and the action.  
The story in ""Full Metal Panic"" is kinda incomplete, with a lot of it involving the ""Whispered"". The problem is that they don't really explain much about the Whispered, so by the end I was still kinda clueless about what they are. My first instinct is to blame it on GONZO, since throwing out ideas without thinking/developing/explaining them through properly is exactly the kind of thing they usually do. But now I think about it, this time the blame is probably with the manga source material rather than with the studio. I was kinda hoping ""Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid"" would be able to provide more answers, but now that I've seen it, I'm disappointed to say that it doesn't. 
The cast of ""Full Metal Panic"" are also mostly templates taken out of their respective genres. You have the usual cold blooded, evil, ruthless and insane main villain taken from a typical action movie, and the loud mouthed, aggressive female lead taken from the school life settings. Admittedly the latter did fall into the likeable side of the fence rather than the annoying (I'm thinking of Asuka from Evangelion here). The sniper guy is a bit more interesting though, and no, not because he's a bit of a perv. What struck me was how useless the guy is at close combat. We're so used to seeing the generically all round elite soldier type who so commonly feature in today's media that it makes a refreshing change to see someone who's got clear strengths and weaknesses that reflect his role in the squad. 
You've most likely seen the captain somewhere before. Tess - an innocent, ditzy teenage girl playing an important role on a warship, as a captain no less. Sounds familiar? [Hint hint: ""Nadesico"", ""Vandread""]) In fact I hated her more than most, for some reason she just gets on my nerves sooo baaadly. Probably because she sticks out like a sore thumb when they're trying to sell the story off as more serious oriented as opposed to comedy oriented like in ""Martian Successor Nadesico"". Sure she's a genius that has ""special abilities"", but special abilities and brain power alone doesn't make a good captain - that's why you never see a complete geek playing the captain role . The primary traits required for the job are leadership and presence... and it would be too kind to say that she has zero presence... she has bloody negative presence. Small, clumsy, pretty teenage girl with squeaky voice who often looks to her second in command for reassurance whilst commanding a ship full of hardcore mercenaries? Sounds like recipe for rebellion to me. Are all these hardcore mercenaries really gonna stomach taking commands from someone like her and do no worse than wolf whistle behind her back? I have a hard time imagining it. She's pretty much a purely fanservice character. And if there's one thing I hate more than a fanservice oriented character, it's a fanservice character that plays an important role and ends up distorting a more serious storyline. But the worst thing is that is that the anime plays up this cuteness thing during the character interactions so you can't even claim that it's all superficial - notice all the guys in the mercenary group goes around saying how cute/hot Tessa is as though that's her defining characteristic. Maybe I'm the crazy one here, for thinking that the defining characteristic of a 16 year old captain should be something other than ""cute""! *rolleyes* I wonder whether the full version of her name - Testarossa - is based off the word ""testosterone"", as it seems her whole fan-servicey design is geared towards stimulating the production of that particular hormone from the male viewers... 
Luckily, there is one character that truly shines - and the bonus is that he happens to be the main character. Yes, it's that infamous Sagara Sousuke. In fact, he pretty much carries the anime on his back. He provides the extra spark that distinguishes this action/comedy series from its peers. Without him the anime would be a lot more dull and unremarkable. Unlike Tess, his comedy attributes doesn't ""clash"" with the settings very much because the jokes that involve him comes from the fact that he does his job not incompetently, but rather TOO competently. He doesn't know anything OTHER than doing his job. And this is clever because this one defining aspect of his character enables him to fill both the comedy role and the serious role perfectly. When it comes to comedy, he shines as it's mainly his inability to get out of his military mindset when in school (along with Chidori's reactions to his antics) that provides most of the chuckles for the show. When in serious mode, his hardcore military side allow him to play a believable and key role in the serious missions. In contrast, Tess is a complete failure - her comedy bumbling scenes just makes me grimace and her unignorable presence on the serious missions makes me grimace even harder. 
For a while I was undecided whether to label this as good or very good... but Sousuke probably tipped the scales in the anime's favour. Still, this anime owes a lot to ""Full Metal Alchemist"". If it wasn't for people searching for ""Full Metal Alchemist"" and accidently stumbling across this show (like my friends and I did), I doubt it would have gotten so popular. On its own merit, it's an anime that has out performed its mostly unremarkable potential. Mostly.

    Full Metal Panic! is the light-hearted story of a military teen with aspergers syndrome who teams up with a high school girl with ADHD and hilarity ensues.  
At least that would be the story if there were no robots in it. 
This anime fits the bill of being your typical high-school-romantic-comedy with the only major difference being that it's also a mecha anime. The story mostly revolves around the two characters Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori. 
Sousuke I-got-a-stick-up-my-ass Sagara is a mercenary working for the top secret military organization MITHRIL who has been assigned to protect Kaname from a host of terrorists and governments who want to kidnap her. Part of what makes the comedy in this story is the fact that as a hardened military veteran at the age of seventeen Sousuke's understandably unable to cope with civilian life in a High School setting. Though when it comes to social etiquette and cues he seems so dense that light appears to bend around him. Not only that, but his military discipline seems to make him so uptight he'd shit diamonds if you fed him enough coal for a week. The writers on this series tend to overplay these two aspects of the character way too much unintentionally making him the most socially retarded protagonist since Shinji Ikari. 
Kaname I-just-did-a-line-of-coke Chidori is the ala cart Tsundere girl in the series. So high-maintenance that she crosses into total-bitch territory a few times, her job is to adjust Sousuke to the peaceful life of Japan while making sure both of them don't get killed in the process. She is selfish, vain and very self-conscience. So, basically your typical high-school girl. Her manic behavior would be a major turn off if it weren't for the fact that she is also extremely good looking. Like Sousuke, the novelty of her character runs out of steam quickly and almost makes you wish Sousuke would just throw her to the wolves so as not to deal with her incessant harping. 
Though I do give this anime a lot of shit I will concede the fact that the concept is pretty decent as well as the terrorist sub-plots throughout. I'll also mention that I do in fact like the manga which is what got me to watch the anime in the first place. However, Sousuke and Kaname, two of the major pillars that make Full Metal Panic! an action-comedy both fail to deliver on the comedy part (no thanks to the writers). The jokes eventually become self-referential and go from being the selling point to the crutch of the show, much like a dog gnawing on it's own leg to get out of a bear trap.  
I give this one a five out of ten if only for trying to combine mecha, romance and high school comedy into one show, despite in my opinion failing at doing both and unfortunately creating a total mediocrity as a result. This also is because it falls into the category among anime fans of either being totally awesome or a bag of shit. Truth be told it's somewhere in the middle. Love may bloom on the battle field with this one, but watch out: it's a flower that comes with thorns.

    I'm strongly of the opinion that Full Metal Panic is a wasted opportunity. It takes an interesting universe and an interesting political situation which would later be modified and evoked by Gundam 00, and then doesn't quite know if it wants to be a real robot show, a super robot show or a high-school comedy. 
My main problem with the mech combat is the ""gimmick"" of the main units - the Lambda Driver. Essentially it's a thing which makes the impossible possible, acting variously as a force field, an energy weapon, a TRANS-AM style turbo boost and more. It doesn't work too well in my opinion. Take it out and you've got the potential for exciting mecha fights ala Front Mission or Armored Core, which is an angle not really explored. Leave it in and fights tend to devolve into shouting, clashing barriers and stalemates. 
The main villain for much of the show is an easily hated psycho in the vein of Yazan Gable, Ali Al-Sarshes etc, (female equivalents of course being Anemone, Cynthia Lane and Marida Cruz) with the added bonus of him being smug as hell and very powerful. The parts where he's scheming and fighting are generally very good, although as mentioned before the Lambda Driver makes the fights a little predictable by removing any chance of it being a fair fight. 
However, for a roughly equal amount of the show FMP is a romantic comedy about a socially inept boy and a tsundere schoolgirl in the vein of Asuka Langley Soryu. It's not as funny as it thinks it is (it takes the second series, Fumoffu!, to really make the comedy work by removing the mecha parts) and it sometimes seems interminable, relying on a couple of jokes that don't really go anywhere. 
If you really like high school comedy, you'll probably like these parts. I found they went on a bit long and ultimately weren't as funny as they could have been - and when the comedy mixes with the serious plot it simply leads to characters acting in completely ridiculous ways that sometimes make horror movie victims seem smart. 
What does make FMP enjoyable are the side characters on the mecha half of the show. Tessa and the submarine crew, as well as Sousuke's wingmen, are consistently awesome. There's a good character dynamic set up and I found myself looking forward to their screentime more than the main plot until the very final arc, in which all hell breaks loose. 
I think if FMP better balanced the Kindergarten Cop-esque high school parts with the mecha fights, and got rid of the Lambda Driver's ludicrous capabilities in order to make fights more interesting, it would be a good show. However, for me, the slightly dodgy pacing caused by the inability to smoothly mix the two genres and the at times uninteresting mech combat make it only an above average show.

    Full Metal Panic is a series that tries to please two kinds of viewer, and as a result, succeeds at neither. 
The problem with it, in general, is that Full Metal Panic is both a serious militaristic action series and a high school comedy at the same time. Now, I've seen quite a few things over my years that should not go together, but do anyway. This, however, is not one of them. The two of them are essentially a massive clash, rather than a well-mixed combination. 
The premise of Full Metal Panic is this: Kaname Chidori is one of the ""Whispered"", a group of people who have the power to generate information... or something along those lines. The details are kept vague, for the most part. As a result, terrorist organisations are after her, leading the military superpower Mithril, belonging to no particular government, to send Sosuke Sagara, our main character, into her school disguised as a student to watch over her. Hijinks ensue. 
The high school comedy side of the series is lacking, to say the least. It's mostly the standard material you would expect to see in that kind of series, mainly humour based around comedic misunderstandings, very little of which is really funny at all. Played for laughs most of the time is Sosuke's complete maladjustment to normal society, which is usually more cringeworthy than it is entertaining. 
The military half of the series is considerably more interesting, and are very true to a military style of series, and certainly fit the scene, whatever it may be. They use the perfect blend of dialogue, action, drama and realism to keep those episodes afloat. One of the things I like more about the series is the antagonist Gauron. The pure nihilism of his actions is always entertaining, if questionable. While the questionableness of his actions is, in one way, a good thing, what I refer more to is that you really have to wonder why in the hell he's doing them. One does not simply kidnap, murder, maime, hijack and possibly rape just for the fuck of it, and his reason for doing so isn't given passing mention in the series. The sequel, Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid clears a bit more on the subject, though it is still annoying to watch the first season without his motives brought into question. 
A big problem with the series is the pacing. As one might expect, the constant switching every other episode from wacky comedy to serious action doesn't really work very well. Interesting parts of the story are kept few and far between, and a large number of the episodes in the show are thoroughly pointless. 
Finally, my biggest complaint is the characters. Sosuke Sagara, as of the first season, is a character some enjoyed and others hated, and I have to say that I'm in the second boat with this. His actions, as said before, are generally quite cringeworthy for the comedy side of things, and in the more serious parts of the series he is as much as you would expect of the perfect soldier: a complete tool devoid of personality. Thankfully, the series that follow the first fix these problems and then some, but in the first season he can be really painful to watch. The supporting cast is also horribly one-dimensional. Kaname Chidori is the tsundere, Kurz Weber is the handsome lecher, Melissa Mao is the action chick, and Teletha ""Tessa"" Testerosa is the moe-girl. While Gauron is an excellent antagonist, he really doesn't outweigh the bad cast on show here. 
In technical terms, Full Metal Panic isn't terrible, but not particularly great. The animation is OK, but there's a lot of CG scattered around the place. The music is unremarkable, and the voice acting isn't particularly great in either language. I wouldn't particularly recommend either track over the other. I'd say this kind of show works better in dub (the military side of it, anyway), so that would probably be a good choice, but if you generally prefer subs then you really aren't missing anything. 
Overall, despite being pretty clearly flawed, it's hard to call Full Metal Panic outright bad. It's watchable on its own, in particular with the help of Gauron, and the series that followed (Fummofu and The Second Raid) are more than excellent enough to make this season worth watching just for the sake of watching those. 
Final Words: 
By no means a bad series, but very hit-and-miss. Worth watching if only to see the sequels.

    -- [ Full Metal Panic :: Eps: 24 :: Overall: 9 ] - 
Full Metal Panic. Now, this is something which you will want to see! It's a very good mixture of humour, action and suspense. In fact, it balanced everything very well so that the anime is neither too heavy, nor too light. It's serious, without being too serious, if you see what I mean. Well, there aren't many things to criticize about Full Metal Panic (FMP), rather there are many things to compliment. Up to now, I found nothing particularly bad. Save perhaps for the lack of details here and there. But if you think a bit, or rewatch it, everything becomes clear. In brief, Animation is great. Sound is very satisfactory. Story is great. Characters are very detailed. And the enjoyment is ever present! What more to ask for? Let me start the detailed review then. 
- [ Animation = 9 ] - 
FMP was one of the first animes I saw. It must have been like 5 years before. But when I started watching, I found the animation extremely good. The colours were vivid, the play on lights was well made, the choice of colours rendered the moods well, and the overall animation was fluid. FMP is about mechas and other machinery. These were well detailed and very well designed, in terms of futuristic ideas and components. The characters too were well drawn, the eyes a bit too big sometimes which ruins the realism. However, they are cute, specially the girls. There are hardly any frame-reuse or things like that. The scenes too were good, although they are hardly animated (if you compare to the likes of Black Lagoon). However, FMP has a good standard. And also, note the use of CGI here and there, specially for the Dannan submarine and underwater scenes. For once, the CGI is good, and not bizarre like some animes portray. There are hardly any glitches in the animation, earning FMP a 9 for animation. 
- [ Sound = 9] - 
Sound rarely gets my attention. Here is was worth it. The music used is lively and suits the moods well. They can switch from heavy to lively in an instant, and through the use of sound effects, the transition is smooth. They did a good job on the soundworks for FMP. The OP and ED are good, although I have a preference for the OP's music. There are not much in-episode music, but when they come, they are good! 
The voice actors too did their job, and did a great work at displaying the various emotions of the chracters, from the stern Sagara to the lively Chidori. It might just be me, but sometimes, I found the tones just slightly exaggerated. (However, this seems normal since all of Chidori's moods are exaggerated!) 
- [ Story = 9 ] - 
FMP packs a great story. I've seen animes revolve around mecha, displaying a wide array of fights and explosions, without a really good story. However, FMP did well again here. 
The story is that of Kaname Chidori who is one of the Whispered, but who lives as a normal schoolgirl, unknowing of her own powers. The Whispered have special abilities that allow them to interact with machines and possess enormous amounts of knowledge on various things. They can design extremely complex machinery with their knowledge. Now, other organisations are after the Whispered to gain access to their knowledge, for the development of weapons and such. Sagara Souske is given the mission to protect Chidori, along with his comrades Melissa Mao and Weber Kruz. Sagara is a millitary expert and extremely proficient at his trade. He works under the command of Mithril, a high-tech mercenary organization. 
The mission seems simple, but for Sagara who is foreign to normal school-life, things can get pretty dirty. Chidori things Sagara is stalking him, whereas he thinks he's protecting her. Expect lots of humour, ecchiness and fan-hits. Yes, paper-fan hits! 
As you see, the story is quite complex and lively, and it ends beautifully. Not only that, there are 2 sequels afterwards, and 3 OVAs! If you want more FMP afterwards, check out FMP: Fumoffu (Joke episodes and fun) and FMP: The Second Raid (The second volet of FMP). The OVAs are pretty much humouristic than story-oriented. 
I gave it an 8 because sometimes, the plot can be just a bit difficult to understand due to a lack of clear details. 
- [ Character = 9 ] - 
The characters in FMP, although not many, are very diversed. Sagara is too stern. Chidori is extremely lively. Weber is too relaxed. Mao is a perv. Tessa is an all-out Sagara admirer. Sagara? He lives in a nutshell like a hermit! :P 
The characters and their behavior are very varied, and through interaction with each other, they evolve (no they are NOT pokemon!) and become better. It's quite fun to see this evolution, specially the haphazard one of Sagara! 
Their respective backgrounds are also well introduced. Nothing is rushed and we are given enough details about them. Not too much (since the rest comes in the sequels). We also get to see the strange behavior of Sagara, like carrying a big arsenal of guns wherever he goes, and being over-protective of Chidori, who doesn't know she's protected. All these add to the fun! 
- [ Value and Enjoyment = 9 ] - 
FMP is really funny sometimes. The constant blunders of Sagara will always get you laughing. However, if you are looking for suspense and mystery, you'll also find it in FMP, when the stuff about Whispered comes up. If you are looking for mecha action and fights, you will be satisfied too! 
There is also a fair bit of ecchiness for those who like it.. Also, expect violence and fights. 
The rewatch value lies in going back to the fun parts of FMP, and also to check the mysteries again, just to get a better understanding. 
- [ Conclusion ] - 
FMP deserves a watch. It's a good anime, and well balanced at that. It's sequel too are good. So give it a try and you will not regret it IMHO...

    STORY 
Basically, Sargeant Sagara Sousuke, from the anti-terrorism organization Mithril, goes undercover to protect Chidori Kaname, a girl who holds the key to &quot;Black Technology&quot; and is targeted by a terrorist and mastermind criminal. The twist is that Sousuke is socially retarded and he enjoys using his military knowledge in everyday life which causes all kinds of problems and hilarious situations. This definitely was not one of the more believable shows I&rsquo;ve encountered.  How could one of the world&rsquo;s most feared and professional military units have a 16 year old commander who tolerates abuse from her peers and subordinates?  If you can get past this (I did), the storyline was pretty good.  
ANIMATION 
As expected from GONZO, the animation was good. The character and mecha designs weren&rsquo;t the most original I&rsquo;ve encountered. One good point worth mentioning was the contrasting choices of colors. The battle/war scenes were expectedly dark and brooding, whilst the na&iuml;ve and cheerful school environment was vibrantly bright. It was very nice and clean, and very colorful with the variety of characters' hair colors.The unimpressove cg for the submarine was the only thing that bothered me though. Most of the animation was pretty good, but it didn't really leave a big impression on me. 
MUSIC 
The OP and ED were extremely pleasant songs. The ED was especially serene. Even though I didn&rsquo;t listen to it in full after all 24 episodes, it definitely was near to that. The voice actors also really fit their characters. From the emotional Chidori to serious Sousuke. 
CHARACTERS 
9/10 
This is the forte of FMP. Each and every character is distinct and very likeable. It would be hard not to find a character in this show that you would not like. Also, the chemistry between Chidori and Sousuke really drives the plot forward. My favorite characters have to be Chidori, Sousuke and Testarossa. Chidori looks like an angel but can be a tough opponent the next moment. Enter Sousuke the professional teenage soldier who has no clue how to live as a normal student. Hence he keeps seeing a terrorist in almost every person, leading him to save her many times from things harmless. It was a joy to watch their relationship develop. I can't quite put my finger on why I like Testarossa but her being there added something to both Chidori and Sousuke characters that would otherwise be missing. She is also a solid character by herself, caring for her crew and trying to do the right thing but she is clumsy to the core and I suspect a hopeless romantic. 
ENJOYMENT 
Great series and theres still more! Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid still awaits and it has a bundle of surprises just like this series. I couldn't stop watching this series even if my arms were cut off. Pretty grotesque but thats how fun this anime was. I loved the bipolar nature of this series. One episode a light-hearted high school comedy, the next a serious action adventure. 
I would recommend this without any hesitation. A fun, enjoyable and entertaining watch.

    What, that's it? 
Despite not being much of a mecha fan, I decided to check this series out after a lot of strong recommendations from friends and online sites alike. I was expecting a compelling story, jaw-dropping action scenes, and decent humor. Those predictions went zero for three. 
Instead, I got a series which seems to have no clue what kind of story it wants to tell. Is it a romance story framed around action and comedy? Or is it an action series with comedy and romance thrown in? This synthesis can work, as long as the director is talented enough, and as long as putting these different elements together actually makes sense. Here, it doesn't.  
It's ridiculously contrived; there's no logical reason for a secret military organization to protect a Japanese schoolgirl, there's no explanation for why they would do so by any means other than kidnapping her, and there's no attempt at justifying a valuable military agent being used for that purpose.  The whole pay-off here is supposed to be the humor in a naive member of the Special Forces going undercover in a Japanese high school.    
Now, if this set-up was treated as something absurd in its own right, with the fourth wall being broken, it could work.  But therein lies the problem.  It's treated seriously, just like a 14 year old, pink-haired, cute girl with giant eyes and a soft voice being the supreme commander of our secret military organization is treated with stone-faced sincerity, also.   
Then, the viewer is suddenly expected to care when the show takes a serious turn, and our Japanese schoolgirl heroine Chidori is kidnapped by an evil terrorist.  It just doesn't work together; either stick with a humorous, light-hearted comedy approach, or go with a suspenseful action series instead. 
Worse still, neither the comedy, action, nor the romance in this series is particularly good. 
The humor was bland. A lot of canned, frequently repeated jokes from live action films, and too much of it based on a clueless military protagonist who doesn't understand civilians, a running gag which wears thin quickly.  Most disappointingly, the show at no point mocks its own absurd premise.   
The cast is filled with shallow, cliche characters, stereotypical and retarded anime conventions (high school girls beat up a highly trained military operative), and perplexing and unreasonable events. One can't make a solid romance in such circumstances, either. 
The action was marginal at best, and an awful, mailed in job at the worst. The hand-to-hand fighting was stiff, awkward, and is worse than at least half the action anime from the nineties, let alone this decade. The mecha action was worse than any Gundam series from the mid 90's onward. 
The positives of the series is that it has good pacing and at least tries to inject some comedy into the work. The animation is also nice. That's about it. Don't believe the rest of the hype.

    When I first started watching this series, I had very high hopes for this, due to many of my friends saying great things about this series. You can safely say that I was not disappointed.  
This series follows a member of the Mithril organization, Sousuke Sagara. He has been assigned with the task of protecting a high school girl, Chidori Kaname, from terrorists and other bad people. To do this, he has to enroll in her high school. Of course, when Sousuke is a stiff with no experience or knowledge whatsoever when it comes to socializing with other people, trouble is predestined to arise. 
The story of this anime series is pretty good. In one moment, you're watching an intense and serious battle situation, where giant robot fights it out with futuristic technology, and in the next, you're watching a really good high school comedy. This series changes between those two a lot, and it's done well, because you get a mix of genres, varying from mecha to high school comedy at its best. This makes the story really enjoyable. There's one flaw, however, and that's the all to open ending of the series. But then again, it has a sequel, so I'm okay with that. 
I really loved the animation style in this series. It didn't have a lot of unique features, if any at all, so I can't and won't give it a top score. There was however no noticeable flaws, and some very cool CGI at times (usually I'm not a fan of CGI in anime, but it was done pretty well here).  
The soundtrack of this anime was, well, pretty average. It can boast about good OP and ED themes, but aside that, it's not very much to listen to at all. 
The series feature a lot of various characters, from the un-killable bad guy to the stiff, no-experience-in-socializing military kid and the ever so normal teenage girl. There's a lot of other various characters (like a pacifistic girl who's the leader of the good guys' organization (at least she's the captain of their main submarine)), and the woman-loving, easy-going guy. Yes, the characters can seem very unoriginal, but I still enjoyed watching them. There was not a lot of character development present; aside a teeny bit on Chidori and Sousuke's part. 
All in all, this was a very enjoyable anime series, and I'm keeping my hopes up for the sequel, as well as the spin-off. If you enjoy some good action as well as high school humor, you should definitely watch this series. 
To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)

    This is a really fun anime. I would have to say it’s like Soul Eater if it was more of a real vibe to it. I love how the language was brought back into the roaring 20’s, the English actors did a fine job working on getting the language right even if sometimes I don’t get the language. I don’t like how some of the extras sound a bit like they are in England or Scotland instead of America. This is supposed to be set in America, but I can only understand it if they were immigrants, not police or authority figures.  
I fell in love with Chrono and Rosette, their fun antics and personality playing off one another sometimes makes the funniest scenes!  
Their outfits feel a lot like the outfits in Trinity Blood, and I think some of them look like rip offs though I don’t know if that was supposed to happen. The animation is really good, though once in a while, it does get weak once in a while. The whole show has this grungy look to it which feels like it was made to be that way with the time frame. The whole story just seems to fit with the whole story.  
The music is wonderful, and the opening song just gets stuck in my head with how beautiful it is. It’s a really touching song that makes me want to watch more. The ending is alright, not capturing my mind as much though. The music in the show fits the mood well, giving the comical parts an addition as well as the more serious parts. The Voice acting is nice and as I said before, they really did take the time to learn the language that was used then. I don’t care much for Sister Kate though. It just seems too whiny a lot.

    chrono crusade centers around a girl who made a contract with a demon to help her search fro her brother and how the order for which she works for deals with the situation in the early 1900s. 
The story is fantastic. I have never seen anything like it.It inculcates many elements such as supernatural,romance(suttle),comedy,historical,drama. Though the romance that occurs between the characters is not very dramatic it is one of the rare &quot;versions&quot; that is also quite romantic in its own way. I loved the story for how it was able to incorporate the supernatural element into such a life-like story,as if the story itself is real as they do follow real events in history. The story is also very deep containing many themes such as the despair and suffereing during the time as well as questioning christianity itself.so if you are a devout christian who hates being discriminated or to see an alternative i suggest you don't watch this, but i feel this theme is what makes the story very interesting as well. The story also has a good deal of action to keep you glued to the screen. 
The art is nothing special, it can be a bit cartoony at times to portray the comedy but besides that it is of a good standard. 
I loved the opening and closing songs, i felt that they were very suited for a drama anime like this. Also, the songs that are sung during the show are quite soothing and the choices were good. 
The characters were another spectacular feat. The main characters all are deep, as you get to know about their pasts and their resolutions. What makes them so interesting is how they are in continuous conflict with the desires of their heart and how they face reality, i feel that the characters do portray very well a lot of the themes and bring out the realness of the anime by how life-like they are. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the anime as there was a good mix of the genres, so it would not be to dark and serious and the comic relief is done up quite nicely to allow optimum enjoyment, while not making the anime seem childish or stupid. Though i must say that the anime is quite dark in that its not all happy endings due to the realism, but this is what i like about the anime as we can empathize a lot with the characters due to the realism. 
so if you are looking for an anime with depth and meaning and a good sesnse of realism along with a dabble of supernatural and ethnicity then give this anime a try. Truly a masterpiece.

    So, I discovered my favorite anime series...through the syfy channel.  Never thought I would say that.  I discovered this show one night at like 2 in the morning on the syfy channel.  I thought it looked pretty cool, so I decided to look it up.  I was not expecting it to be what it was though.  The first couple episodes make it seem like it's not going to take itself very seriously.  It seemed like just a fun anime.  If you can get past the beginning, though, man things get real.  The story is very grounded in religion which I really like.  I really liked all of the main characters and thought they were really well done.  This one will also bring a surprising amount of feels to the surface too.  So, if you think a strong, plot driven, religious based anime sounds interesting you should definitely check this one out.

I think I don't have much to comment on the art since it's inevitable that our tastes change and pssh.. It's 2013 already... Though as far as I've remember I liked the art... 
I think I don't have any complaints with the characters anyway I saw some development in them so yeah. 
Now this is what dragged this anime down to the bottom of the pits of hell (ok i'm exaggerating), I really liked the story at first because it was interesting for me. Though what I didn't liked was the ending. Hmm I think the author was just being realistic with how he/she ended it though too much of realism made it so unrealistic. I'm fine with the drama and everything though I think there was nothing resolved, and that the conflict was still there. I was looking forward to a great ending but it wasn't the kind of ending I'd expect from it. 
Anyway this is just how my own opinion, a lot of people likes this anime, but yeah. :)

    O.K so this will probably be my only review for an anime.  But what I say from Chrno Crusade is something I could barely comprehend.  I was enjoying the first 10 episode, then from 11-18 i was extremly bored.  From 18+ it was very enjoyable again, but for an anime like this to have an ending like that.  It was too much, i believe that the creator should have put a little more thought.  I realize I should not write about spoilers but it is hard when the part i feel most strongly about will be a spoiler.  I can understand the ending but on the other hand it terrifys me.  To think that you could go through 24 episodes just to end on a crappy note.  I have yet to like an animes ending partially because I don't want to see it end, and partially because I believe it can be fixed.  Chrno Crusade is no exception, from my perspective the ending was poorly done.  Before all you haters who obviously gunna hate tell me, what was so amazing about it?  Why would you make that choice?  I will give you an answer to why I am right.

    Well, after i started in 2005 to watch this series, i finally finished it now. It's very solid with some unique aspects. 
Well, you start with a nun, that also works as an exorcist at the Magdalene Order and her assistant,  a demon called Chrno. In the beginning the story seems funny and has a comedic touch on it. however, as you progress with the show, Rosette gets more companies and you'll see more and more of the sad story, some nice flashbacks, interesting subplots and an unique ending. 
Animation: 8/10 
We are in the 1920s, so the people, clothing and scenerys are like then. The people wear hats and suits, the cars seem very old and the houses have this typical gothic-style, you know. The only thing, that disappointed me, were the main characters. Sometimes they just looked too shiny to be in the 1920s. 
Sound: 7/10 
The themes fitted in every situation, but it was nothing memorable. The OP was fine and ED just fitted too well. It was happy, but on the same time it was melancholic. Only Azmaria's singing was a bit annoying. Everytime she sang, her voice just seemed to change suddenly. 
Character: 8/10 
The characters are fine, like they are. Some of them are more, some are less deeper. However, almost every single character develops in it's own way. The canon pairings are fine and the characters don't overact. The twists of the characters were nice, though. 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
It was hard to go through the first episodes, but then, the story gets very enjoyable. In almost every episode you get answers and new questions. That works very fine, it's the same with the twists. 
It takes time for the story, but if you are over the first episodes, it gets only better.

    4/10 
(I'm trying to keep this spoiler free) 
This anime I felt started out back and got better and better for the most part. Then the last 4 episodes hit. They seemed to destroy the characters that they had built up. Then show ends with you know who is still alive just cause and the end of the main characters story felt rushed, forced and just odd all around. This thing have so many holes in the the plot it looks like Swiss cheese. I thought I was liking this anime (even with the plot holes) to just it all ripped away in the last 4 episodes. 
I can see how some people might like this but it for me just destroyed a good story and had me give it a 4/10 
I'd like people to watch it cause I do think some can enjoy it but this was sadly a horrible end to a great anime and destroyed it for me 
To be honest it's hard to write a good review on this anime cause of the fact I loved and hated it. But I do encourage people to watch it I just feel as if it didn't click for me. 
I really wish there was a way people could commit on this review cause for sure I know some will hate me for this.

    This show is simply phenomenal in all ways that I want an anime to be. The story is beautifully crafted throughout the whole thing, the art is up to par with the story, the music fits the 20's scene perfectly. I was with the show every moment, and I have no grips on the show expect for the dub version in my opinion ruined it for me, though the sub I felt was much better. I think this show is a must watch for everyone who wants good story, art and character development.

    I'm probably wrong; There probably never was a GONZO ""before,"" ""after,"" nor ""during such-and-such time."" I always thought that (after watching Trinity Blood, Glass Fleet, and Last Exile) GONZO was one of those good ""art-house"" companies (where Gainax and SHAFT were considered the bad ones). I didn't realize that it's so bad in Japan that it's anime industry resorted to catering to the shounen-hating, ""2D is my girlfriend,"" anti-reality types. 
With that said; Chrono Crusade is probably one of the rare attempts from Japan's anime industry at telling a story that's based on America and its culture. 
It's a good story overall: Mostly hardboiled and ""cop-buddy-themed,"" sometimes whimsical, a third of the time LOUDLY YELLING (Thank you, HillHaag and Greg.), doing its best ""for the otaku"" but realizing that it's a ""serious, edge-of-ya-seat anime based in AMERICA."" It didn't spawn as much fan-based h-doujin material like Saki did, but it counter-programmed like a Belmont slewing 100 demons. So yeah.

    A fun and cheerful anime ends with a tragedy. When I finished watching Chrno Crusade a began thinking about Christian religion, and about god. 
And it also made me realize how importent life is and every moment we spend with our love one's. And it show's that every love story can't have a happy ending. 
Rosette reminded me a lot of Naruto. She has a sorten glow to her that changes other people opinion on her and they begin to care about her. And she never gives up and never go's back on her word, and she could be very stupid sometimes. She was a strong woman, and that made me as a viewer care what happened to her. It took me some time to like Chrono, but when he proved in the end that he was someone that would fight for what he really care's about. 
This anime won't leave you with a satisfying ending or a satisfying feeling. But it will leave you lot's of question's on what is importent in life and what is worth holding on.

    At first it seems like just any other anime, that it will be lots of episodes that don't relate to each other of Rosette and her demon companion hunting down various demons, but no, it is not, at some point the anime simply changes itself to an awesome storyline. I won't say much because I don't wanna spoil anyone's fun here, but don't be fooled by the first episodes, it will get better. A lot.

    I was kind of interested in this story from the beginning. I just really wanted to know what happened with Joshua and I wanted to know more about Chrno. I didn't know if I would like Rosette at first, but actually I really liked her personality after watching a few episodes.  
I normally don't really like or dislike demons, but in this anime I really liked Chrno. It was kind of interesting to watch how other people would react to him, because he was a demon between humans.  
At first the story was very normal for me, like every other anime, but it was still enjoyable to watch. But even though I already enjoyed it quite a bit, it became just more and more interesting as I watched the episodes. I didn't think that there would be a story like that behind it, and I really liked the story they came up with.  
The art was kind of good, I really liked how the characters looked and I liked their personalities. I actually almost liked everyone, and that doesn't happen that often. Well, I admit that I once again didn't like everyone, but I liked the most of them. Their voices were good and they didn't annoy me. I actually really liked it when Azmaria screamed, because she has a scream that you actually wouldn't really expect. I don't hear screams like that quite often, most of the time they annoy me in animes, but this time it didn't.  
In the end I was a little disappointed though, because it didn't really turn out the way I wanted it to. And there were a few things that I wanted to see happening, but they didn't happen, so that was a little bit a let down. The story wasn't totally unique too, so I couldn't give it a 10, but I gave it a 9 because I enjoyed it  a lot. It made me happy at some times, but I've cried a few times too. There were a few sad parts in it, but it was kind of beautiful too. Personally I enjoyed watching this anime.

    Chrno Crusade is a story filled with supernatural battles featured around Heaven, Earth, and the Devils. The story goes as far as philosophizing doubts of Heaven and the sins of Devils. This in turn either empowers your faith in the Almighty or otherwise. Needless to say, faith always prevails.  
The story follows a young girl in the Magdalan order. An order of sisters who dish out punishment to Devils. The story is kind of playful in this concept and can lead to intense battles and situations with these Devils. Obviously, Devils are powerful and bloodthirsty and not easy to take down. 
As the episodes progress, the plot line does as well and certain elements of the story fall into place. In fact, more time is invested into the actually story in the later episodes, while the beginning episodes give you a feel for the characters and the whole scenario of things. 
I'll give this rating system a try: 
Story - 9/10  All questions answered. 
Graphics - 9/10 Older artwork, but very well put together. 
Humour - 8/10 Occasionally perverted ( this is an order of all girls, I mean sisters ), but never too overboard that I thought it forced or unnecessary. 
Character personas - 10/10  Very distinct character personalities, though there is a lot of yelling. 
Soundtrack - 8/10 Dramatic and well placed. 
Voice acting - 9/10 Fit the characters personas. 
Overall - 8/10 
Recommended: Yes

    Short and simple: I put off on watching this, but after giving a few more more episodes a try I was swept in. Without giving too much away, the story revolves around a headstrong Order Sister, named Rosette, who seeks her missing sibling. She does this alongside her companion, Chrono. Honestly, characters are a strong point in this anime. They and the supporting characters each have their own unique aspects, and only grow more dimensional as the series continues. 
The story initially seems serious, but it's so much more. It's a perfect mix of comedy/shounen/drama. You'll smile in its lighthearted moments, sit on the edge of your seat during battle, and tear up (if you're emotional) in the more dramatic moments. 
Overall, it's fast paced but captivating. Definitely worth watching.

    This is by far the best anime/manga I've ever seen ^_^ It is absolutely perfect! It made my laugh, it made me cry, I totally fell in love with the story and the characters, you're not going to find a better anything then this. I guarantee you that you will love everything about Chrono Crusade. Ladies-Keep watching and you'll see the HAAAAWTEST anime guy known to man. You'll love Chrono for being so sweet (and for putting up with the always hilarious Rosette!) Azmaria is adorable, Aion is an awesome bad guy, Shader is super cute, Joshua is intriguing, Satella is funny and tough, and Rosette is brave and has a short fuse that can go off at any moment. This anime/manga is the best!  
^^SPOILER ALERT^^ 
I like the ending in the anime WAAAAAAAAAY better then in the manga. It's way  
sweeter. Because Rosette and Chrono die together ^w^

    I am definately not exaggerrating the scores, this anime is worth every point! Let's start off with the review of the story. Don't let the christian connotations put you off, Chrno Crusade just skims the most intriging parts of the religion. Good for some, but not others, Chrno Crusade doesn't emphasise too strongly at the romantic connection between Chrno and Rosette until near the end of the series; but even then the writeers expertly twists their relations to bring tension and awe to the viewers. 
The art: very effective. Although there are killing and blood, the gore is not too explicit (again, good for some, not others). A large variety of facial expressions used effectively on each characters. Very nice landscape art too, especially ones of the lake... There's just the right amounts of darkness and holyness in the anime (i meant it in terms of art, not content) 
Definately my favorite anime opening song. OSTs are also used very well in the anime to perfecly suit each scene. 
Character. Can't really talk too much about them without giving away spoilers. Protangonists are not overly holy. Antagonists evil and powerful and COoOL. 
Enjoyment: wished there were points beyond 10...enough said.  
Overall: again, 20/10.

i can vaguely remember this anime when i watched this years ago. i wanted to watch it but my mom would have always interrupted. anyway, it's the usual good vs. evil story but! something is different which pretty much makes it a good plot. ehe ^__^ but i do not approve of how the portrayed nuns (with guns) the nuns who ran our school weren't anything like them. haha. 
art is okay.. and 'okay' means uhm.. it's pretty neat. yeah.. i guess.  haha. now, that isn't a bit helpful is it? haha. i didn't particularly paid attention about the sound but i guess it pulled the way through. okay, generally, aesthetics supports the plot well enough. nothing to complain about :)

    Chrono Crusade was a very enjoyable anime that had a very good mix of humor and drama. The voice actors did an amazing job in conveying the desperate struggle that they are going through, and you truly come to love each of the characters. I don't recommend this to a young crowd, as there are some scenes that are not suitable for children.

    Chrono crusade is definitely a very interesting anime. The story seems kinda of light and not going anywhere in the beginning but then the story picks up suddenly with the introduction of Ion, an evil demon with incredible power. They do a wonderful job at portraying the characters and their intentions and/or desires throughout the series. Chrono has also a very fulfilling ending even with its cliffhanger at the end of the series. Overall I would say Chrono crusade is definitely worth watching if you haven't already.

    NON-SPOILER REVIEW 
So let's first get some things out of the way. I do NOT recommend you watch this. I personally dropped it 2-3 times before episode 12 and decided to come back and finish it out of the blue one day. 
Animation: Holds up really well if you excuse the 4:3 aspect ratio. 
Characters: They're actually pretty good and likable. 
Story: The story is pretty good for the first 8-10 episodes and maybe episodes 12-16. Sadly though around episode 16-19 the story begins to drag heavily feeling like One Piece. The last 4 are incredibly slow and drawn out but if you manage to hold out until the last episode you'll realize how it was 100% NOT worth it in the slightest. 
All of the fights end within 30 seconds very anticlimactically, and the ending is a shoe-horned ""we must reset the world"" (figuratively) ending overall leaving you with a very bitter taste in your mouth knowing so much could have been done to have made it better. 
Due to the ending, explaining why it's so bad without spoiling it is incredibly difficult (for me at least) so you'll either have to watch it or trust me (one of the few who didn't like it). So in a twist this review might actually get you to watch it and be extremely disappointed.

    Chrono Crusade is one of those stories that you'll end up easily missing from the large library of anime that is available to you.  I only just remembered its existence only recently because of the main theme song ""Tsubasa wa Pleasure Line"" being a favorite of mine.  
What had me discover this little gem was way back in the day when the ""Sci-Fi Network"" had an actual anime block called, ""Ani-Mondays"". This was long before Crunchyroll was really a well known service so most of the shows I'd ever watch would be on television.  The block itself consisted of other titles like ""Gundam 00"", ""Gurren Lagann"", and even ""Rave Master"". Thinking back, putting the words ""Sci-Fi Network"" and ""Anime"" together was truly a weird thing to behold.  
What had me so attached to this particular show on the block was one specific reason: the writing holds no fear. Trying to even remotely compare the beginning to the end will have you absolutely stunned at how the script progresses into a bitter sweet web of reality.  It has a weird similarity to that of ""Cowboy Bebop"" where you have so many fun loving plot threads within that  makes you completely forget about how serious the story actually is.   
And let me tell you..Chrono Crusade works great in such a format.  It  broke my heart to see the main leads ""Chrono"" and ""Rosette"" specifically go from such a wacky goofy duo to devoted partners with an honest acceptance of what may be in their world.  They both do something that can be a rarity sometimes  in current anime: grow up psychologically together.  I never felt like either one of them was left behind for the sake of making the opposite protagonist look better.  By the end, all I had was endless tears with a nod of acceptance on what the Author was aiming for. I got the message right before the last heart warming scene played.  
Do keep in mind, the manga and anime share completely different endings as they drift apart after roughly volume 4.  However.. both have an interesting reflection from one another that is worth checking out.  
Overall: Chrono Crusade will forever rest in my heart as a show that gave me a better understanding on why life can be so difficult. Its a series that really stands a heavy message on facing the worst that reality can offer but still finding a stepping stone through it.  It gives an excellent perspective that nothing can be perfect but it doesn't mean we can't try to find something at least close to it.

    Since many other reviewers have gone and given a lot more detail I'll keep this short by saying it's a excellent anime series and here's my short review. 
Chrono Crusade is based of a manga, which I highly recommend everyone reads, because it's even better than the anime. The Anime follows Chrono a demon and Rosette a nun around on their journey trying to find Rosette's brother Joshua. The adventure take them to new characters, like Azmaria, and Satella. The final six episodes are truly some of the best anime you'll ever see. The pure emotion put into the last six episodes was amazing, and the final episode was just so sad to watch. If anyone likes a show about many things including religion, love and friendship this is for you, but let me warn you don't expect a happy ending, but then ending still won't let you down either.

    STORY (8) 
Although I though the story was pretty unique, I found that most of it was highly predictable. If not that, it was a bit confusing. It almost seemed like the anime had skipped scenes, because it didn't have an easy flow to follow. It felt rather choppy to me at times. The superb ending to this anime was its saving grace. 
ART (7) 
Nothing special, but it was appealing visually. The art was not compelling, but it also wasn't cheaply or poorly done. It was solid animation.  
SOUND (8) 
Now... I watched the English dub. Many people would murder me for this, but I actually enjoy not having to read my shows every once in a while. I can focus more on the animation and action this way. I really loved the fact that accents were involved, mainly Satella's great German accent. I loved Chrono's voice actor as well. My only complaint is that Rosette's voice was pretty annoying.  
CHARACTER (9) 
Most of the characters were wonderful and developed. Although I simply could not stand Joshua. I became very bored and annoyed with scenes centered on him. Overall, seemed like a nearly useless character. I loved Chrono and Rosette, though. Satella topped as my favorite, hoever. 
OVERALL (7) 
Definitely a good anime. I would give it a 7.5 if I could. ALMOST an 8, if it weren't for the confusion I mentioned before. I'm really glad I stuck with this anime until the ending, because it was wonderfully executed. I would recommend Chrono Crusade.

    WARNING, CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS! 
Chrono Crusade 
Review By: John Fragglepuss Evans 
You might enjoy this if: Religious anime and the Roaring 20s intrigue you. 
You might not like it if: You want a story that gets right to the point. 
Note to the Viewer: You will either love it or hate it. 
EXPANDED REVIEW FROM SLC ANIME:  
SLC Anime reviewed Chrono Crusade this month. One positive mentioned about this anime was regarding the historical events that it portrayed. As a reminder, Chrono Crusade is set in the 1920s in New York. The writers took care to add historical events to this anime, and that was appreciated. To go along with that, the group found it interesting to see the Japanese take on Western culture and religion. Another positive was regarding the magic system in the anime. It was an intriguing system for some of the group. Lastly, the finale of the series was greatly seen as a positive by the group. I will not give it away, but it was the consensus that the ending was appropriate. 
The main negative review was regarding the slow progression of the story. It was mentioned that the story could have been told in 12 episodes, but was instead extended to 24 episodes. That being said, for somebody that truly enjoys the story, the more episodes the better. However, the slow progression seemed to impact the group’s interest in the anime negatively. Another negative was regarding a lack of interest in many of the characters. There were many characters in the show, but many of them lacked development, being one dimensional throughout the series. Being a 24 episode series, there was plenty of time to develop and add backstory to the characters. By the end of the series, there were simply few characters that we were invested in. 
There were mixed feelings regarding the use of religion in the series. Some group members found it to be overdone while others found the use of historical references in religion fascinating. 
Overall, Chrono Crusade was fairly polarizing for the group. Some people enjoyed it while others did not enjoy it at all.

    Chrno Crusade is a lovely anime serie that as a great importance in my life, because I remember when I was in high school, every tuesdays I get excited to go home and watch a new episode on TV. 
Now, I still like it but I consider some episodes to be a little bit out of the concept.  
The last episode, for me was the best of all.

    I first came across this anime in May this year. It is now November, a few weeks after finishing this anime, and I feel as though I must urge potential viewers not to make the same mistake I did all those months ago, lest you miss out on an outstanding anime. 
Don't judge it by the first episode. 
The first episode pales in comparison to the next 23. I finished Chrno Crusade and for a while all I could do was stare at the screen in awe.  
I'm putting on a big dramatic air here, but I really did feel as though this was what a perfect anime felt like. 
The story. The characters. The stakes. 
It was done perfectly.  
Rosette is a STRONG character. She might come off as being erratic and irresponsible at first glance, but throughout the series I really came to understand just how deep her feelings of dedication, duty and loyalty towards finding her brother were. And when mixed with the bittersweet story of how she and Chrno ended up being intimately linked with each other made for an anime that you know is only going to end with tragedy. 
If you love this anime, you will cry. 
Some people might not think that Chrno's backstory was covered enough for the story to make sense. Sometimes it might seem like he's just a plot-convenient piece to be moved when it fits. But I think that enough was mentioned for me to get the overall picture without the story suddenly revolving around his angsty backstory. Certainly, his motivations about how he came to work with Rosette and the Magdalene Order are important, but this is a story about Rosette, her personal mission, and the short amount of time that she had in order to accomplish it. 
If you've come here looking for romance, then take a pass. There *are* moments that pass between Rosette and Chrno, but it most certainly isn't the focus of this anime (at least from my perspective). It is subtle at times, but very sweet. Just thought I'd mention it, in case you were wondering. The moments that did pass were very bittersweet and there is one image in particular in the last episode that I just can't get out of my head. 
The other characters, Azmaria and Satella make for an interesting pair. Azmaria gives strong Wendy (Fairy Tail) vibes but she's very sweet when she isn't getting in the way. Satella also has someone she wants to find, and she bonds with Rosette over this throughout the episodes. 
Action is good, the suspense is good. There are even comedy parts to lighten the mood when needed. Chrno Crusade's strongest point is its dramatic side. 
Some people have complained about how it ended, but I suspect that is only because it wasn't the happy ending 'all the bad guys are dead so let's move on now' that they wanted and expected. I thought it was satisfying and again, bittersweet. That word is how I would describe the entire series. 
I was fascinated by the impact that religion has on the overall plot which continued to intrigue me as time went on. 
Again, I must stress the point. Don't give this up if the first episode bores you - it has much more to offer if you let it. 
I went from watching one episode in 5 months, to watching all of them in one day. It is a hidden gem that deserves to be in my top anime list.

    Produced between mid 2003 and June 2004 by Studio GONZO DIGIMATION (Saikano, Last Exile, Samurai 7), based on the magnificent work of Daisuke and Morimaya dirido brilliantly by Kouyuu (Slayers Premium), this TV series chronicles the 24 episodes Chrno story of a demon (named in the series of ""Sinner"") who sees in his partner Rosette chance to rebuild their lives 
Blending reality and fiction (as the real ""Prophecies of Fatima,"" implanted in the anime so superb and that spoke, for example, the Second World War and the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981 - respectively second and third prophecy . There is still a fourth, not released by the Vatican), ""Chrno Crusade"" is an anime very different from most of the works available on the market with a dramatic originality (and, to some extent, comic) Phenomenal. 
Story 10

The story unfolds over the course of the chapters very well, without ado and complication making the series fruitful in all chapters 
Art 10 
The anime art leads well before the time when the story is based in the turbulent '20s and its soundtrack, background orchestra very well the plot leaving nothing to be desired 
Sound 10

Character 10 
The characters that compose the anime are all very well made and designed and each with its role and performing very well ... 
Rosette and Chrno are one of the most beautiful love story ever created in anime ...

    I think this anime is probably one of those hidden good anime that are out there. Covered by the main stream horror and action anime this has its own place from almost the beginning in a way.  
The story is what i would call an emotional rollercoaster at times the feelings you get from watching and listening to whats happening in it is crazy coming from an anime thats got demons , exorists and what not. The original and new spin on the struggle in hell and the feelings of revenge that comes from it unleashed upon our world. Strangely if i say that about this anime you might expect action scenes in every episode or something like it but thats were your wrong. This anime takes time to give you the story and not just the characters. There will rarely be a time for anyone to question whats happening because there is a big chance that answer will be answered through the story faster than you might think.  
The music captures and shows greatly how this anime is filled with a religious feel yet a demonic feel. It gives the watcher that extra edge when they listen to the fights between and hear the story comming from the different characters.  
The character are made to fit this anime greatly.There is never a time there i think that character doesnt fit in with the rest. From everything to the dual Main characters to the different bad guys springing forth.  
When i first watched this anime i got addicted from the first episode but it also gave me the hint of the emotional feelings i will always have when i revisit it.  
The overall joy and sadness that comes from this anime is something not found in many newer anime and this makes it its own and this anime gives you what you need. So it deserves 9/10

    Ok Ok.. enough for trolling... Chrno Crusade is one of the great anime of all times.. As you can see it has great twist of plot.. I really hope it has a remake and follow the manga coz the manga has a better ending than the anime.... 
Story (10/10) 
As for story.. It is after the Great War mostly known as World War I. As you may know many of the people during the post war reach prosperity and later suffered into Great Depression.. In this time an exorcist name Rosette who exterminate demons has a partner also a Demon name Chrno/Chrono.. Their real goal is to find Rosette little brother an apostle and later joined by Satella/Stella a Jewel Summoner and Azmaria a Apostle. To face a great threat Aion who is somewhat plotting something 
Art(10/10) 
The Art is somewhat cool and great for an anime that has been released in 2004.. When I saw the preview I thought it was 2007 release. It has a great art and has a great fight scene too. 
Sound(10/10) 
The BGM is something kinda creepy when Shit got Serious.but when humor BGM is kinda humoristic in nature like most anime..The Opening Theme (Pleasure Lines) and The Ending Theme(Sayonara Solitaire) is well blend to anime itself. 
Character(10/10) 
Like most of Fantasy anime the character has a classes like Azmaria is somewhat their healer because she can heal.. Chrono is the back-up and the ace, Satella is the frontier.. Rosette how can I put this errr.. maybe fighting side-by-side Chrno.. It's kinda ironic because an exorcist who exterminate demons has a partner a demon.. And Chrno is the only demon I saw who pray to God. 
Enjoyment(10/10) 
Well throughout the episodes it's interesting and curiosity will run down through your veins.. And the fight scene is good too.. well it's the first anime or TV series I saw that the Servant of Gods fight side-by-side by demons mostly the pursuers(you'll know what I mean if you watch the series coz I don't want to spoil you). 
Overall (10/10) 
Well Chrno Crusade is a well made anime but I really hope it follows the manga until the very end. I recommend you to watch it. I even re-watch it many time because it's really great.. I really want to see it's remake.. I hope when they remake it it'll follow the manga :))

    Short review. A bit flame like. 
This is one of those animes which I had first read the manga then ventured seeing the anime. And, also, one of those few that I simply wanted to scream.... not of joy but of despair!  
The story starts to follow the main manga plot, some small changes here and there, but mostly understandable... But when it came to the end...That's when all hell brakes loose! A real disappointment. IF you've read the manga, please don't waist your time seeing the last few episodes.  
The only good thing must have been the opening music, a real treat.

    Recommended for people who want a really good Supernatural/Demons related storyline with plenty of action,twists & turns,a bit of sweet romance & so on. <3  
So,I basically chose to watch this anime completely on a whim,thinking that It would be be a generic & dull show...But I was so very wrong...this show was much more better & enjoyable than I expected It to be. 
A beautiful storyline that revolves around a Voluptuos young Nun/Exorcist who hunts & exorcises demons with an unusual partner who is a demon himself...Sounds pretty average at first I know,but as you go through few episodes It turns out to be a lot more than a simple story as we find out the real agenda behind the Girl's hard work to exterminate demons & finding her lost brother & so on..The action scene were pretty good too....It has some fun moments,some dark ones..& some emotional ones too...The way the story connects to some historical incidents & the Bible was very interesting too. 
The soundtracks were really good,The OP/Ed is beautiful too...The artstyle/Animation is brilliant as well considering It was released on 2003. 
The character development was quite good in this anime too,Even the important side characters had really good backstories & significance in the story too..All the characters are very adorable,especially the female protagonist...The sly antagonist was perfect for this kind of story. 
So,If you want a good & enjoyable storyline..That has fun moments,dark ones...& a bit of romance as well then this is a must watch anime for you.

    (one little spolier ahead) 
Of all series that come's with a religious outlook soo powerful it comes from the mind of Daisuke Moriyama Chrono Crusade embarkes on a very adventurous were the outlook the christian faith have been completly altered, were god is our father & are here to store balanced & to hold our faith...or so we think the story take as any other good impulsive Rosette make good & just in 1020's New york with along side Chrono her contract parther, but like all decision's she has a moving motovation to driver to find her brother as her Chrono, & all her friends go face there demon's it also leave us to know of ourself's & were we are in life 
My reason for recomending is for the obvious knowlage that you recive(if you have not read the bible)also the light moment's it give's to the views for example the love of Chrono & Rosette at the San fransisco carnival this series will leave you with happy tear's of joy & show now matter what ""All good thing's must come to an end"" & with that said Sayonara Solitaire if you loved Fullmetal Alchemist or D.Grey Man you must watch Chrono Crusade a gem of it's own goodness

    I can't fathom why this is rated so high. The first 12 episode were decent. They're an okay comedy action thingy. But once the plot starts to move, it just becomes stupid. 
The main story was really bad. Aion makes this extremely convoluted and unnecessary complicated plan to do something, and just ends up dying anticlimactically at the end. After watching the entire series, i honestly can't tell you what Aion was trying to do, or why he was doing it. 
 The last 12 episodes are so bad it brings this down to a 3. Characters do things for no reason. Nothing is explained. By the end, i didn't care the slightest bit about any of the characters. I didn't care it they lived or died, or what happened to them. The last episode had more characters doing inexplicable and random things that make more sense, but there is one scene where Rose and Chrono die. It's actually the only decent scene that makes sense in the last half of the show. It's actually a great scene, one might say beautiful, but I didn't care about the characters so i felt absolutely no emotion in that scene. What a waste. I felt this scene was good enough to raise my rating to a 4. 
I didn't really like the art. It wasn't bad, it just didn't fit the series. It seems too cartoony and happy for something trying(and failing) to be deep and dark. Chrono in his true form looks goofy and stupid. 
It should also be noted that the author of this has no understanding of christianity. I don't understand why animes keep doing this. If you're going to butcher chistianity, just make up a fake religion instead of trying to be clever.

    The story is about a girl, Rosette,  who wants to find her little brother (he's missing at that time), her comrade is a demon, but he's very kind, and protective, and wants to find her brother as well for her sake. it's a sweet story, with action, demons, and mysteries. 
I think the art is pretty good, especially for an anime, the art is an important thing for an anime, and I think they succeed with that. 
The personalities could have been better worked out, especially with Rosette. She's not really an original character, as with the most girls, she's very protective and thinks first about others than herself. But I don't think the characters are bad or something, 'cause they're good, but it could have been better. 
I really enjoyed this serie, (not all the time, some moments were very sad) but it's easy to watch at it. It was definetly one of the better series I have watched.  
This anime is certainly a must !!

       I am sure as hell glad that I did not put this one down after the first couple episodes. Chrno Crusade had surprised all my expectations, and I'm not talking about the overall art, sound, the quality of the story (not that it's not important), but I'm talking about the enjoyment. After the few couple lagging episodes, you get dragged into some enjoyable moments. Action packed, fast paced, emotional, dramatic, serious, and funny moments characterize the greatness of Chrno Crusade. 
    The story was good, but not great. The struggles and dark conflicts with demons and mankind may seem interesting , but while watching the series, you may find yourself a little detached from the plot and more adhered to other aspects. The story revolves around the two heroes who are suppose to destroy other demons threatening mankind and also with rosette's own personal quest to find her brother. But all things considered, the plot is not that strong and the storyline I described is more like a facade for the action and other side events.  
      The dark animation art is not bad, not eye popping either. I'm actually very impressed with sound esp. with voice acting and the soundtrack. The soundtrack music during the dark moments and during the very emotional scenes had a profound effect including the various piano pieces. The opening is fine but the ending song is very very memorable and fits how the anime ends. 
      Character development and likeness is alright but the only character that stands out for me was Rosette. Displaying humorous, reckless, &amp;  juvenile traits in the beginning, then revealing her emotional and assertive side later on. A very strong and likeable character from start to finish. 
      The enjoyment gets a high score because of simply the wide range of aspects in this anime that just made it so fun and memorable to watch. The raw action and emotion are at their peak from the middle to the end. It just doesn't receive the perfect 10 for enjoyment because there sadly are those episodes that have dull fights and fastforwarding moments.  
     I believe the strongest point in this anime was the ending. I think that if I typed this review up right after I finished the end, I would give it a 10 overall, riding on my emotions. There are times in this anime where you'll have to think and draw upon the events of the time but otherwise, it's all guns and demons from there on. I highly recommend if you're an action junkie who also likes dark/serious plots.

    I've been watching and collecting anime, in earnest, for nearly a decade now.  I won't be in romance with most of the series, because I've seen them years ago; including this one.   
Chrno or Chrono Crusade is a Christian tale about a demon (Chrno) and a pact he makes with the heroine (Rosette Christopher).  Rosette and company is in the business of busting demons, until she falls in love with one. 
It's a well written narrative, being comedic at times.  It has some off color humor, and hints at corruption within religions.  The series shines in its comedy, heart, and the relationships between the characters.  This tale takes the stance that time is of the essence and to make the most of the time we have.   
It's an older anime and from sometimes unpraised Studio Gonzo (they deserve more praise).  It doesn't break new ground visually, but the music is very good and fitting for this anime series.  Sayonara Solitia is perhaps my favorite closing anime song.  Overall, this anime was a joy to watch!  It deserves more viewers and to be on everyone's TOP 100 List.

    Well, even with distorted story well and with little explanation about the events, there can forget Chrno Crusade. In my humble opinion, one of the best of the supernatural genre. Well, let the review: 
Story (9/10) 
Well, as I already mentioned above, the story followed a completely different route from the manga. The story in the anime, it was a little hard to understand and some events were cut from the anime. But does not have much to complain about the story, the story in the anime even not following much of the manga, it was great. I do not know what happened, but the end of the anime is something that leaves most of the people who did not follow the manga confused. When I watched the first time, I also was very confused. It's something you can not understand very well without reading the manga, but once understood, the story gets really interesting. In the manga happens pretty much the same things, but differently. The story just did not get a 10 because of several things cut from the anime and that most of the events had a bad explanation, especially at the end. 
Art (9/10) 
I found it very interesting animation for that time. Even if it is not the best animation in the world, we have to consider the time it was released. I generally do not like the animations of Gonzo, had several I've ever seen with a deplorable art. I do not have much to talk about the art of Chrno Crusade. It was one of the few good animations of Gonzo. 
Sound (10/10) 
I really liked the songs presented in the anime, it was very well chosen. The ending is something I can not explain. Music is more than perfect, and the way the music is similar with the history of anime is awesome. I think that's one of the things that make this anime is so good. 
Character (10/10) 
I think are lacking in today's anime characters with personalities that you find in Chrno Crusade. My favorite character is Rosette. But I like almost all the characters. The only one I can hate the anime is the Aion (I wonder why?). Chrno has a unique personality. It's hard to watch this anime and do not like it. Azmaria is very cute, she is in charge of leaving the funny anime. Satella is the typical antagonist that we see in various animes out there, but with the course of the story it becomes a great character. Rosette is complete. She is very clumsy, also has a great nose when the business is to find problems in the beginning it is very cold compared to Chrno. What she likes most is to help others. This is not cute? The reason for my hatred for Aion is simple and short, ""I will destroy the world"" and many other things like that, did this character come all my hate. But I must admit it was well spent. 
Enjoyment (10/10) 
I enjoyed the anime. The end made me very perplexed, I was very thoughtful and I did not think so good at the time. Soon I tried the manga and then I could understand the events. I remember after finishing, I stopped to see some anime. I cried a lot after the end, ahh we skip that part, it is too painful for me. 
Honestly, it's almost impossible not to like this anime. The anime has few flaws and many are not remarkable for someone who does not know the series. Chrno Crusade was one of my first anime, anime is hard to review, not the end in itself, but to know that will not be more when it's over those 24 episodes. If you are looking for a comedy, romance, and a bit of action, Chrno Crusade is the anime.

    Chrono Crusade, what else can be said about this show, it has a perfect mix of comedy and drama, and not to mention the show is incredibly fast paced, I would say that the ending to Chrono Crusade is one of those rare animes that actually gives closure to the show. 
The character of Aion (the main villain) is probably one of the best characters I have ever seen in terms of a villain, he isn't a cliche villain, he's more cunning and he seems to love using others and manipulating people's hearts to get what he wants. 
I seriously urge people to give the dub a try, it is by far much better then the original audio, the dub sticks very close to the original script and does add some 1920's period slang to keep it topical. The show itself should not be missed. You will love it!

    I'll make this review somewhat quick. Chrno Crusade was simply an alright series. While it has issues, I enjoyed the series somewhat and if it's on your watchlist and you have nothing else you want to watch, go ahead and give it a go. It's not bad but it isn't great either.  
The art was acceptable but I couldn't get over that Kids-WB-saturday-morning-cartoon look. Most animations were crisp and clean but there were corners cut, especially with flying characters (ever flying scene was a static character moving around the screen), and the awkward animations of some side characters.  
The story was decent and did suffer from pacing issues. At the start it's entertaining and fast paced (but not too quick) but about a dozen episodes in, the pacing slows to a crawl. Episodes go by with little to nothing of importance happening. There is lots of entertainment to be had in the first few episodes but it's somewhat sporadic after that. 
The characters spend too much time being tongue-in-cheek to allow themselves to be taken seriously later on. That being said, the chemistry between the protagonists is some of what helps the series go from being mediocre to just 'okay'. The characters each have their own goal and they work toward their goals as a group and the teamwork aspect was something I enjoyed quite a bit.  
My biggest complaint is the latter part of the series. The anime release outpaced the manga release and it shows. Despite the pacing issues, the anime was progressing fine up until a certain point and the story  Some aspects of the ending are decent and fulfilling but others just don't make sense and you will end up scratching your head (I'm looking at you, final scene) as they rely on information that we aren't ever shown. The climactic battle upset me as it was quick with no tension. Many events within the series are shown to be meaningless to the overall plot and I found that frustrating.

    WARNING: This review contains spoilers for Chrono Crusade because I'm still a dumbass who doesn't know how to review things without spoiling them. 
""Because my time is limited, I don't have time to waste hesitating. That is why I can walk straight ahead. That is why I never stop."" 
Chrono Crusade is an anime adaptation of Daisuke Moriyama's manga, from the ever controversial and bold studio Gonzo, the series made quite a stir back when it aired in 2003 due to elements such as a taboo romance between a nun and a demon, Christian lore integrated into the plot, religious themes and a tragic finale that still to this day is pretty rare to occur in shounen anime. Both the manga and the anime series are among my favorites, but I tend to give special attention to the anime, because it is the version of Chrono Crusade that tends to get the most criticism, either from manga purists who automatically call anything that isn't an exact panel-to-panel adaptation of the source material garbage, or because of criticisms such as ""the whole plot is pointless because everything was for naught"" or ""the second half has an inconsistent tone and gets too convoluted"" and other things commonly said by those plebs who got caught in the filter. In fact, I disagree with the vast majority of the criticism the Chrono Crusade anime receives, as the points tend to be either straight up wrong or only partially right, and I'll discuss some of them in this review when it's relevant to talk about them. 
Anyway... Yup, the Chrono Crusade anime diverges from the manga, even in the first half that adapts the manga storyline, it's still a fairly loose adaptation: Some of the manga-adapted stories play out differently, some chapters of the manga got cut out because they're not relevant to the anime's storyline, several episodes are exclusive to the anime, and the plot in general for the second half is radically different from the source material. However, I don't care if a series follows its source material faithfully or not, as long as it's still a good story, I'm more than willing to accept it for what it is and recommend to anyone else, as I do with the 2003 version of Fullmetal Alchemist and Bokurano, another controversial Gonzo manga adaptation that gets flak for not following the manga. Maybe I'll write a Bokurano review too once I stop being a lazy bastard, but not today. 
Sadly, though, Chrono Crusade is barely discussed nowadays, as older anime tend to fade into obscurity after everyone has already discussed everything about them, unless they're either famous long running shounen or provide quality shitposting material for weebs to keep on making memes and/or waifu wars for eternity, like Evangelion, Code Geass and Darling in the FranXX managed to do. Fortunately, I'm one of those guys who remember Chrono Crusade and still think it's a masterpiece of a series, and since my opinion is the only objectively correct one in the entire internet, you either agree with me, or you're simply wrong. Now, let's properly dive into this series as I try my best to explain what makes it so great. 
Set in America fresh out of World War I and all the prosperity of the roaring 20s, Chrono Crusade tells the story of a nun called Rosette Christopher and her demon partner Chrono as they work for the Order of Magdalene, an organization created to combat the demonic threats that started to mysteriously pop up all over the country. Rosette and Chrono aren't just fighting demons for the sake of it, however, they're after Rosette's brother, Joshua Christopher, who was taken away by a mysterious demon called Aion and his group called the Sinners, all of which seem to share a bit of a history with Chrono. 
The way Chrono Crusade plays out during its first half is somewhat akin to early Fullmetal Alchemist in a sense that it's an action shounen with dark undertones and some comedy thrown in there so the series doesn't get way too gloomy... Often bad and poorly-timed comedy that honestly the series would have been better off without it. But hey, if Fullmetal Alchemist (especially Brotherhood) can get away with that shit, then so can Chrono Crusade. Regardless, the first quarter of Chrono Crusade mostly revolves around Chrono and Rosette taking up demon-hunting missions for the Order as their personalities and relationship get fleshed out and we're introduced to other characters, the most important ones being: Azmaria Hendric, a portuguese soprano singer who's also one of the seven apostles blessed with God's holy power, and Satella Harvenheit, a pair of breasts who's able to summon magical stands with her jewels, called a ""jewel witch"" in the series.  
One of Chrono Crusade's strengths is precisely the interactions between its characters, striking a perfect balance between lighthearted fun, genuinely heartwarming and sad. Chrono and Rosette are at odds with each other in many ways, her being a hot-headed energetic girl who gets in trouble easily while he's calm, composed and passive to a fault, the way they play off of each other and have all this bantz is pretty fun. The series does a fantastic job at showing how different their personalities are, yet at the same time how deep their borderline-romantic bond goes and how much this contract between then hurts on both sides, it's easy to see how important they truly are to each other despite their silly antics as they both grow as characters. Azmaria and Satella, while not having as much focus as the leading pair, still get their fair share of moments, moreso Azmaria than Satella, who unfortunately is a bit underdeveloped in here. 
That's not to say they're not good characters individually, each one of them develops and the character arcs they go through are very satisfying... Mostly. As I mentioned before, Satella leaves a bit to be desired due to her having significantly less screen time than the other three, but it's good enough to be acceptable nonetheless. The character arcs are mostly tied to the central themes of the series: Mortality, faith, loss, family, stuggling with the past, and last but not least, the concept of ""good"" and ""evil"" and how the line between those two opposites is blurrier than we believe, and all of these are more or less incorporated into the main protagonist, Rosette. 
The way Rosette is handled is a brilliant example of subtle characterization and development, she's presented as this idealistic headstrong girl who, despite having a tragic past that caused her to essentially miss out on enjoying childhood and adolescence, as well as making a contract that's cut her life short and will prevent her from making up for that in the future, is still very optimistic, passionate and caring towards the people around her. But Rosette isn't quite the shounen hero she appears to be at the start of the series, that's more like an image she puts up in order to convince Chrono and the others, as well as herself, that she's fine and it'll all turn well in the end. Rosette isn't really fine, though, her traumatic past and the fact that most of her short life was spent fighting and looking for her brother are taking a toll on her, emotionally she's far weaker than she lets it show and fears that she might die before saving Joshua.  
The series starts to show this around episode 8, when one of the Sinners, Rizelle, mentions Joshua and actually succeeds in convincing Rosette to board a train with her under the promise that she will see her brother if she goes with them. Rosette was actually willing to abandon everyone that was on her side just for a slight chance at getting to Joshua, not even caring if she could be walking alone into a trap or anything, and if Minister Remington hadn't stopped her at the last second, she would probably be in a much worse situation. From that episode onwards, Rosette still retains her lighthearted personality, but at the same time she also slowly starts to get gloomier, she gets visibly disturbed by seeing people die because she, more than anybody, knows how valuable life is. Around episode 16 Rosette doesn't resemble her earlier self all that much, she's more fearful of what will happen to her, especially because of the holy stigmata that started to appear on her body. 
The last time we see Rosette being lighthearted and having fun with her friends is on episode 18 during the festival, but even that episode has a really sad undertone as Rosette and Chrono talk about how important they are to each other and Chrono states that he does not intend to live longer than her. If this was Rosette from the earlier episodes, she would get angry at Chrono for being overdramatic and wanting to throw his life away for her, but now that she has even less time than before and got considerably less certain of her future, she reluctantly accepts his wish of dying together with her. It's one of my favorite scenes and shows how far they are now from the goofy pair we saw in the first couple of episodes. 
Then things go to hell right at the end of that episode and never go back to being lighthearted fun again... It all culminates in one of the most powerful and gut-wrenching final episodes I've seen in any anime, probably the most well-known episode from this series too. However, as much as I love the final episode and have it as my favorite, I disagree with the notion of some people that it's ""by far"" the best episode and the rest of the series doesn't compare. No, the final episode is only as good as it is because of how the rest of the series built up to that conclusion, if you detach it from the rest it becomes just another tear-jerking moment and loses its impact. 
Final episode aside, the other characters receive quite a bit of development too, but they don't have as much focus as Rosette, not even Chrono. I mean, Chrono is a very good character here and has a well done arc exploring the trauma he suffers from his own past way before he met Rosette and Joshua and how it affects him in the present, but I always thought he played second fiddle to Rosette way too much. Aside from when he transforms into his true form and uses the full extent of his demon powers to fight at the cost of Rosette's lifespan, he's kind of weak and gets his ass kicked around quite a bit, and I feel it would have been more interesting to have him fight in his sealed form too instead of just being some kind of support while Rosette does the fighting. Nevertheless, it is a minor complaint, he's still a well-written character for the most part, my only gripe is that I wish his past with Aion, the Sinners and Mary Magdalene wasn't explored in just one episode, it came off as a bit rushed. 
Azmaria's character arc, unlike what people usually assume, is not about her becoming a badass fighter who can take on demons like Rosette, people often call her useless because of her fear of demons during combat, but that's not really the point. I mean, she does say she wants to get stronger, but she's still just a 12 year old girl who's been through a lot of grief and has zero combat experience, you don't just become an amazing demon hunter overnight. Azmaria's story is about her finding her place in the world after losing her parents to WWI at a very young age and her status as an Apostle blessed with God's power causing her to become a target of people who want to use her powers for their own gain, leading her to be adopted by Ricardo Hendric, one of the early villains in the series, and the band of singers with whom she traveled around the country to get killed by demons.  
After being Rescued by Chrono and Rosette and joining the Order, Azmaria is shown to be submissive and have an incredibly low self-esteem as she blames herself for all the tragedy that's happened with those around her and does not believe her own worth. Inspired by Rosette, she becomes determined to change into a better and stronger person, but of course, this is a tough road for such a young girl, so she still shows more than a few signs of weakness until later in the series when she's matured, so much that when Chrono is at his lowest point moping about how he's taken Rosette's life away, she's the one who reminds him that there's much more to their relationship than just him draining her life away, which puts him back on track. I just love Azmaria's growth from a girl who believes he's worthless due to only bringing misfortune to those around her to realizing she deserves to be happy, and most importantly, she is capable of bringing happines to those important to her, the Christmas episode focused on her is one of my favorite episodes because of this. 
Satella... Is the weakest of the main characters. Not because she's a bad character herself, but she's mostly separated from the other three doing her own business, and her arc is a bit cookie-cutter: She holds a grudge against demons because her family was slaughtered by a mysterious hornless demon who's taken away her older sister and is totally not Aion, and she thinks Chrono might be the one since he also doesn't have horns, but starts to warm up to him later and becomes friendlier towards Rosette and Azmaria too as she begins to trust them more. She's pretty likeable, though, and there are a couple interesting aspects to her, the parallels between her and Rosette are nice and episode 11 (one of the weaker episodes, unfortunately) at least does a good job at portraying how different their views on life and sacrifice are despite their similar struggle.  
A few minor characters also get some development as the series goes on, mainly Sister Kate, the leader of the Order's NY branch who's not very happy with Chrono being Rosette's partner in the ranks of the Order as she, along with pretty much everyone else, views demons as pure evil. Sister Kate gets a bit of Rosette's optimism rubbed on her and starts to appreciate Chrono as well, which leads to her defending him as an important member of the Order later in a discussion with the higher-ups when they were offered to join forces with the demons in order to fight the Sinners, who are a common enemy. I find it interesting that Sister Kate did not back off from defending Chrono and suggesting that they take this offer, even though everyone was criticizing her for it, and this experience changed quite a bit about her faith, she started to question some of the things God apparently planned for everyone, even though she still keeps believing. 
I wish more was done with other characters who had potential and ended up playing a relatively minor role, like Joshua, Fiore and Remington. I mean, Remington does a handful of stuff in the story, but I feel the twist regarding his actual status later in the series could have been better used. Regardless, I don't think there's any bad character to speak of here at least, just some that could have been done better and a few others that are just mediocre or forgettable. 
As the series goes on, it introduces a handful of plot elements: The Prophecies of Fatima, the seven Apostles, the Astral Line, which is more or less the Lifestream from Final Fantasy VII, the demons' source of power being their horns which draw energy from the Astral Line and Chrono's lack of horns forcing him into using Rosette's life as a substitute source, we get some glimpses of the demon world Pandemonium, the mother of all demons who's also called Pandemonium. All of this stuff gets properly explained in the series, but I wish we got more of Pandemonium... Both Pandemoniums, since details about the demon society and how Pandemonium was ruled are pretty scarce, but what's been shown is at least enough for me to get what was going on: The Sinners killed Pandemonium and stole its head, throwing their society into chaos and causing them to be branded as traitors by the other demons who are still hunting them to this day. 
And this leads us to Aion... Who is a fairly difficult character to talk about, actually. In a sense, I guess you could say that superficially he's evil for the sake of being evil and embodies the most despicable aspects of any living being, but he's a much more nuanced take on this type of villain. Aion seems to be inspired by the prophecized Antichrist especially in the final stretch of the series, his goal is to collect the Apostles and use their power along with the head of Pandemonium to get rid of God and the system he binds the demons to, essentially using them as tools to test people's faith, increasing his authority as a result. Through Aion, the series puts God in a more negative perspective, as the big bad does some horrible things to everyone and asks why doesn't God show up to stop him if he's able to do so, constantly mocking and blaming God for everything. With time, you start to question the same thing, like... Yes, why doesn't God do something about Aion? Does he not care about what's happening on the Earth? Does he think humanity deserves to be tormented by Aion like that? What's his deal anyway? I'm pretty sure everyone has asked questions like these before, it's natural that we expect an all-powerful benevolent being who created us to be able to do something about the bad things that happen. 
Chrono Crusade's portrayal of God is not necessarily that he's evil or that he's uncaring of his creations, after all he gave humanity the means to fight the demons off and even blessed a few among us with a fraction of his own power in order to assist us. But God also gave us free will, we can use the gifts he gave us in any way we want, and unfortunately cases like Azmaria's power being used by terrible people for their own gain happen. Even in the real world we see things like pastors using God's name and performing ""miracles"" just to get money out of people who are too blinded by their faith to realize that they're being deceived. But in Chrono Crusade's case, you can argue that God was actually watching all along and only decided to act when it was most convenient to him, not by personally showing up and stopping Aion, but by giving Azmaria a power boost when things got out of hand at episode 7, or giving Rosette the holy stigmata. It's like God is still manipulating everyone into acting according to his plan, even Aion who fails to realize it and still believes he's doing something that will bring an end to God. 
Basically, what Chrono Crusade has to say about religion and God isn't that they're bad, but that God is a mysterious figure, we don't know who exactly God is or what he wants, so we shouldn't be blinded by our faith like so many people out there end up becoming. And religion, while having many good people attached to it, can also bring out the bad aspects of other people, the final stretch of the series even shows how easily people who fell into despair can be manipulated by someone who poses themselves as some kind of holy savior to them, becoming completely oblivious to this person's true intentions. It's a much smarter way to tackle this subject than the cynical ""naw man religion bad"" message that's often present in japanese and even a handful of western works.  
The writers certainly did their homework, the way Christian lore and symbolism are incorporated into Chrono Crusade's plot doesn't feel like it was done by people who don't know what they're talking about. Even if certain liberties were taken, like demons being capable of being good and working with humans while in actual Christianity they're just pure unadulterated evil, but that's part of the themes here. Due to how they were created, demons and humans are different in nature, the former leaning towards evil and the latter towards good, but much like humans are capable of going against their nature and doing bad things, demons can do the same and perform good acts... Because, you know... Things aren't black and white. During the final episode, it is implied that after Rosette and Chrono died together, her soul definitely won't be damned to hell by God for dealing with a demon, and I think this moment makes it very clear that God also does not view things in black and white either. 
In any case... Chrono Crusade is still an action shounen series at heart, which makes it easy for some people to just write the more complex aspects of the plot off, because apparently a fun action shounen can't possibly have anything profound to say. A common criticism is that the series suffers from tonal shifts, which I agree, but they're not nearly as bad as they're made out to be. The poorly-timed bad comedy certainly helps with the tonal shifts and I'd rather not have pervy old man boob jookes, as well as the (thankfully few) fanservice moments feel out of place. But when I see people saying the series ""suddenly"" becomes very dark in the final quarter which is supposed to be totally inconsistent with the rest of it being a lighthearted action shounen, I have to ask... What series were you watching? Because it's definitely not Chrono Crusade. 
It's true that the final quarter of the series is much darker than the rest, but it's simply not a case of a fun action series that suddenly became an apocalyptic tragedy. The dark and tragic elements of Chrono Crusade were always there since the beginning: Chrono and Rosette's contract slowly killing her, characters like Azmaria and Ricardo were victims of tragedy from World War I, Satella's family was murdered right in front of her, the story of how Rosette and Joshua met Chrono, how he was taken away by Aion and how the contract between Chrono and Rosette was form was anything but happy, there's the entirety of episode 7... I could go on, but I think you get what I'm saying. As much as the series presented itself as an action shounen with some lightearted moments and episodes, it always had a dark atmosphere as well, it just didn't take the center stage completely until the climax from episode 18 onwards, but the progression towards a darker tone was always visible. 
Regardless, Chrono Crusade is a well-paced series for the most part. There's one episode in particular, that being episode 14, that I feel could have been cut off because it doesn't really offer anything of significance despite being cute and all. And really, I think the time spent in this episode could have been used instead to add more time to the events in episodes 21 to 23, because they do feel like they're unfolding a little too quickly, and an extra episode to cover what happens in them would certainly help. But aside from that one episode, all of the others contribute to the narrative of the series, the ones that don't advance the plot all that much give more insight on the characters and the setting. Speaking of setting... Yes, I think there are some historical inaccuracies, but I don't really care much for that kind of thing. I usually accept this kind of stuff as alternate pasts, and as long as they at least capture the feeling of whatever period in the past they're trying to go for I'm fine with it, and Chrono Crusade captures the atmosphere of 1920s America very well. 
Production-wise... Well... It's a Gonzo series, which means the series can look very good for most of the time, but then in some episodes it decides to look like complete shit with off-model characters and awkward animation. Fortunately, the badly-animated episodes are a minority, and while the art and character designs may very much be a product of 2000s, they're all colorful and distinct, so it's pleasing to the eyes at least, and the scenery is fantastic, with lots of details and vivid colors to look at. Action scenes are pretty solid, demons (especially the Sinners) are pretty threatening in a sense that they seem to be invulnerable to a lot of the weaponry Rosette has and can require a bit of brains to be dealt with, I just don't get why they chose the demon aura color to be yellow, it doesn't really match them very well, but alright then.  
To make up for the standard Gonzo production, there's a gorgeous soundtrack to listen to as you watch the series unfold, the opening theme is good but standard for anime, and the ending is just amazing in its melancholy, Sayonara Solitia is one of my favorite ending tracks ever... But aside from that, the music is pretty good, it's largely orchestral stuff with some jazzy tracks, and my favorites being the ones that play during the sadder moments of the series, especially the one that plays in Chrono and Rosette's final moments, it's just so beautiful it hurts. 
This write-up has already been way longer than necessary, so I guess I should stop. I just wanted to express how much I love Chrono Crusade, it's not very common for me to feel touched by an anime series the same way I did with this one. I'm not one to cry to stuff like anime, games or even movies, but the final episode of Chrono Crusade is one of the few things that made me almost shed a tear. Despite the rough edges, this is a fantastic series that manages to be fun, heartwarming, tragic and genuinely meaningful in one package. Maybe the religous elements won't be for everyone and I understand that, but it is what elevated Chrono Crusade from simply a good action shounen to something greater and more unique to me. Gonzo may be a hit-and-miss studio overall, but this is one of their shows that will always have a special place in my heart, I hope I'm able to convince more people to give it a shot.

    I admit the animation is well done and the art is beautiful, but that is that. 
In the end it is a bad developed idea, shows a very poor knowledge of catholic ethos (if you want to make an anime with this concept you need to at least STUDY what you are trying to use to do it in an artful way. The concept was so intriguing at first..) and with very absurd depictions of said organization. I saw it to the end and deleted it whole afterwards.  
The end was also badly ploted and executed.  
And do not mistake me for any religious ascet. I am not. Animes like Trinity Blood work far better using the catholic organization and its truculent side than this one... 
In the religious ideas use for instance Demon Lord Dante has a real interesting plot, using the catholic ethos with much more attention and hability than what was used in this series.That anime is one of my favorites! 
It is sad, for the characters could have been a lot better, and the overall idea was really interesting... 
It was a waste of good art and animation style

    I thought I was lucky to find the complete set for $30 at movie trading company the other day.  I have never been more wrong. In a nut shell this series had lame comedy, lame fan service, a lame story loosely based on Christianity and various mythologies and lame animation.  
Animation - You can clearly see the cheapness of the animation from the start. The action uses a lot of choppy fighting (still frame action or a few cells of animation) and the character/monster models are clearly reused with just minor differences. This is ok if its 20 years old. Not for something made in 2003. 
Sound - It's just not memorable at all.  
Story - I have one word to describe the story. Lame. The way it blends christianity with mythology and mixes contradiction along side factual history is ludicrous. It's not even interesting.  
Characters - Chrno becomes Super Saiyan, screaming and all, when he gets mad but will lose it immediately if someone says &quot;dont please.&quot; 
Enjoyment -  I started to fall asleep during episode 7. Thats never a good sign.  I wouldnt recommend this to anyone.

    Welcome to my Review of Chrono Crusade, this is definitely one of my top 5 rated anime's. I remember the first time I came across this anime was when I was in a anime club where I got free dvd's sent through the mail. I think I checked out a few episodes. They were dubbed though. Viewers beware if you watch this anime, definitely do not watch it dubbed. Its WAY better if you watch this series subbed. I tried giving it a chance until I heard Satala's Dubbed English voice. Her screams were just damaging to the ears lol. 
Chrono Crusade talks about a demon that has lost his powers due to his horn being taken away, and has a contract with a sister called Rosette. In order for Chrono to turn back into his true form (demon), he requires Rosette to give him her life force. The longer he stays in that form, the shorter Rosette's life becomes. Rosette tries to find his missing brother, and Chrono helps her out along this journey.The story is really captivating and keeps the audience looking forward for the next episode. The story stays intact from the beginning until the end, there's almost no made up episodes which are unrelated with the actual plot. Let me reword that, absolutely NO FILLERS. The plot continues its pace through out the anime. The ending is very very sad. Be prepared! 
 The characters are indeed captivating and eye catching, especially the girls. Rosetta Christopher the Heroine is a Nun whom I highly enjoy. She is beautiful, hot, short tempered, does stuff her own way, and can be really selfish at times, clumsy, and never listens to anyone! Azumaria, the sidekick of their group is one cutie pie, her voice is like an Angel's. Not to mention that she sings so gracefully and magnificent.  Its hard for me choose which is my favorite characters, both Chrono and Rosette's play just perfect roles in the plot. The character development is clearly presented,  and you get to know about the character's past, as well as the history to what has been the cause of the present situation. The main villain is way to cool. He doesn't have a bunch of corny lines either like most evil villains do on some anime shows. 
Music: 
Despite having the same opening and ending being played again and again for the entire 24 episodes, the songs were very nice and pleasant to listen to. The lyrics and music are well versed and suitable for the anime. Nothing to complain here, I just love the music. The audio sounds with in the series are perfect and match every moment rather if its a hilarious funny scene or a very emotional sad part. You know something is going to happen when you here the BG music play. 
 Not much to say bout the art. The art is just brilliant with beautiful colors, the animation is just spectacular.  
Enjoyment: 
You will definitely enjoy this series, it starts out kind of slow during the first few episodes but after you watch through a few of the episodes and get to understand the plot, you will be hooked, take my word for it. The first time i watched this series from beginning to end. I watched it all in just two days, stayed up late and kept watching it. I actually worked in the morning during this time and I tried to put the series away, but then i just kept watching it. I should of called in sick that day lol. 
This is a great anime to own and worth your time. However, this anime might not be suitable for audiences who are sensitive towards their religion as they might find it disturbing. It does deal with a bit of Christianity, if this doesn't bother you, then you have nothing to worry bout. I would recommend Chrno Crusade to anyone and looking for something different. This series is kind of similar to hellsing in away in that deals with demons and satanic rituals. I have watched alot of Demon type anime's to name a few, hellsing, Dn Angel, Devil Lady. Other series just don't catch my attention as much as this anime does. The characters are so lovable and memorable, seriously after finishing this anime because of the sad ending, its quite hard to just go right to another series and start watching it. I hope you guys and girls out there would enjoy this series as much as I did. 
10/10

    “Chrno Crusade” is the anime and video game industry’s lame attempt at tricking people who legitimately liked “Chrono Trigger” to give up their hard earned cash in return for satisfying the apparently growing nun fetish in Japan and the West. Considering that this anime has a huge following it seems to illustrate either the appeal of nun T&A to the general anime audience or Chrono Trigger fans not giving two shits about whether the show is related at all to the video game. Though both seem to share the common indifference over the misspelling of “Chrono” in the title (though I hear that it was intentional I still think it’s stupid).  
It’s the roaring 1920s and in this supposedly kick-ass anime the jail-bait-D-cup nun Rosette with her younger demon assistant Chrono (hey second time’s the charm I guess) are on a quest to hunt down demons that are causing pain and suffering because of the general lack of morality in the world or some such BS. 
Rosette who operates on two settings: 5-year-old and full-blown Fran Drescher is the theoretical comic relief to the series. Though she comes off as more annoying, as the writers no doubt deluded themselves into thinking they had channeled Rosette to the character of Auska Langley Soryu, but forgot to carry over the catharsis.  
Chrono, the demon, who carries a laughably huge rotary phone on his back seems slightly more competent than his female counterpart but, always seems to suffer constant verbal abuse from Rosette. I can’t help but think that the only reason he sticks with her besides the contract that binds them is the hope that he’ll be able to eat her out before the series ends. However, she’ll have to start taking her crazy pills and shut up for five-fucking-seconds to make that happen.  
Though there is a story-line to this show, there is a possible ninety-percent chance that you’re motivation to watch this is for the hot nuns. Yeah, they all have suspiciously huge breasts which can only mean that the Vatican is fronting the cash for the boob jobs. It kind of makes sense since the church is always hurting for more money and followers. Not that those breasts do the poor nuns any good since they’ve sworn a life of celibacy and can only wait for the return of Jesus to give him a nice tit-fuck (which gives the phrase “second coming” a whole new meaning). 
In conclusion, skip this anime, watch Full Metal Alchemist instead.

    Chrno Crusade is an early 2000s anime based off of a manga by Moriyama Daisuke. The anime version was handled by the folks at Gonzo. Yes, the Bakuretsu Tenshi, Final Fantasy Unlimited & Trinity Blood studio.  
We open with representatives of the Magdalene order, a religious order that hunts demons, going into action. These are our main characters, Sister Rosette and her daemonic partner Chrno. We quickly learn that Rosette's younger brother, Joshua, was taken to a twisted version of Shibuya to play a reaper's game. I mean, he was kidnapped by a demon named Aion. To search for him, she's formed a pact with her friend, Chrno. The price being her very life force.  
I have to give Moriyama a lot of credit here. The writing is brilliant. It's one of those series where the premise has potential but only if it's handled very well. Which it is. The theme of time is a powerful one and it's handled immaculately. The way the series builds up to big events is superbly done as well. It's very good at giving escalating hints at what's coming and of having worthy pay off.  
This series is also excellent at mixing some more light-hearted comedic elements with its more serious, dramatic moments. Which is one of those things that most media can't manage. But this series handles it by making the comedy more subdued and never going too far with its dramatic elements. Even the most serious moments contain a strong spark of hope and even the most comedic moment has some serious undertone playing out. As a consequence, the shifts are a lot more natural. 
I can also credit the series with having fantastic world building. It doesn't just throw back stories and fantastical terms at you. It eases you into them gradually so, when some aspect actually gets explained, you're able to easily grasp it as part of the world and see where it fits in with the rest. It helps that the visions of heaven, earth and hell in this series are really compelling.  
The ending is absolutely perfect. I won't spoil it, but I will point out that a lesser writer would not have gone with the ending this series has. They would have seen it as too risky or not marketable enough. But it is also the ending that works best with all the build up and events of the series.  
This series also deserves some credit in being one of those rare anime that makes me tear up. There are two scenes in particular where I had to dry my eyes. And I don't cry at that many pieces of media. Especially not after multiple viewings but I re-watched this series for a third time for this review and it still got to me.  
My minor complaint here is that Chrno Crusade has one of those comedic dirty old man characters. To its credit, there is more to the elder than you would usually get with that type of character. He does have some complexity. But it's still a tired and kind of shit archetype to work off of.  
That gripe aside, the characters in this are excellent. Rosette starts out seeming like one of those more brash, action girl heroines. But as the story progresses she gains more complexity and you learn that a lot of her more reckless behaviours tie into her wanting to live every day to its utmost due to her more limited time.  
Every major character is like that. They start with some, simple archetype and elevate it to something unique, complex and interesting. Which also leads to some superb character dynamics and interactions. Chrno and Rosette in particular have a superb bond. The minor characters may not be as perfectly developed and fleshed out, but they have enough complexity to come across as actual people. 
I also have to credit the series for its antagonists. The villains, Aion especially, are complex characters with clear and compelling motivations. Aion makes such an excellent villain because he is very blatantly villainous but he's also got his own twisted reasons behind everything he does and he excels at manipulating others into doing what he needs them to do. He doesn't come across as the most physically intimidating but he doesn't need to because his powers of persuasion and manipulation make him a terrifying opponent.  
My minor gripe here is that there are points where Rosette or Satella will have their clothes torn in battle in a fashion that borders on sexualised. To the series' credit, it never crosses that line but it does come uncomfortably close.  
Aside from that, the artwork is very strong. The demon designs are great. The various technical devices the Magdalene order uses have interesting designs. Steeped in religious imagery, obviously, but that just adds to the aesthetic. Gonzo deserves a lot of credit for framing their important scenes very effectively. For instance, there's a scene towards the end where Rosette is going out and helping people but its framed in such a way that it comes across as very unsettling. And a lot of that comes down to the art since she isn't moving right and there's something just a bit off about her face.  
The action sequences are fairly strong as well. There's a lot of creativity behind them and they're very effectively animated for the tone that the series is going for. The more light-hearted scenes come with more high energy, fun action scenes while the more serious scenes have heavier sequences.  
The performances in this are superlative. Ishida Akira, Kawakami Tomoko, Chiba Saeko and Neya Michiko are all excellent. I don't even care that Neya Michiko's Deutsch isn't quite natural. And you can't fault Inoue Kazuhiko's performance as Aion. The music is excellent as well. Amazing theme tunes with Tsubasa wa Pleasure Line & Sayonara Solitaire and perfectly fashioned in episode music. Which includes some lovely song performances by Saeko Chiba.  
Ho-yay:  
There are moments in Chrno's shown back story that make it seem like maybe he and Aion were more than friends but it's not a lot and there's nothing definitive.  
Areas of Improvement: 
Give the elder a different comedic attribute. Yeah, I admit that I just personally can't stand the dirty old man trope. But even putting that aside, you could definitely do something more unique here.  
Less attire tearing during fights.  
Show a little more of Joshua's fate in the ending. After the effort put in on his behalf, it would be nice to know a bit more about what happens with him.  
Final Thoughts: 
This series is excellent. In terms of writing, acting and animation it's really exemplary. I did struggle a bit with whether to give it a 9 or a 10 since I do have two gripes with it that somewhat affected my enjoyment but given how stellar the whole thing is and how minor they are by comparison to everything it does right, I'm going with a rare 10/10.

    There have been numerous stories that take an unusual view of the war between Heaven and Hell and those who fight that war. Some are focused more on their interpretations of the Divine Mission, some more on action and some more on the supernatural. 
The focus of Chrono Crusade is on its characters and the relationships they share. Of course there's action, too, and supernatural elements, and a touch of the Divine Mission... but mostly it's about its memorable characters. Rosette Christopher, a nun in the Magdalene Order, has a contract with a devil named Chrono, meaning his power comes from her very soul. The more he uses, the shorter her life becomes. But Chrono is a good devil (excuse the oxymoron) with a sad past who only entered into this contract because of extreme circumstances, and is actually doing everything he can not to use her soul up. The two have a long history together and are very close, though at times Rosette's somewhat abrasive personality gets the better of him, leading the two to argue. Whatever conflicts they have, however, they truly love one another, and it is this love and how slowly it comes to the forefront that serves as one of Chrono Crusade's great strengths. 
The anime series, based on the manga series of the same title, starts off essentially the same as its source material, but partway in begins to deviate into an alternate storyline. Even in episodes where it takes inspiration from the manga by including certain locations or events, the anime does its own take, and leads us towards a very, very different ending; it is so different, in fact, that by the last episode it feels as though we've experienced an entirely different story, and in many ways, we have. 
While I would say the manga has the superior story to tell, the anime series tells its own story very well. You would have to have a heart of stone to not come to care about Rosette, Chrono, Azmaria and Satella and the adventures they share. Other areas in which the anime excels are its animation, which is absolutely gorgeous; its music, which is also gorgeous (especially ""Sayonara Solitaire,"" the closing theme); its voice acting (though I'm speaking of the Japanese cast; I have not watched the English dub); and its good balance of humor, action and plot. If the anime has any real weaknesses, they would be the fact that it reveals certain secrets way too soon, and that its final battle is surprisingly underwhelming (to be fair, however, the anime's intent in the final episodes is to focus on Rosette and Chrono's relationship rather than the battle they are fighting). The villains, especially Aion and Fiore, are very well-portrayed and behave exactly the way anyone familiar with the manga would expect them to. Their stories are, of course, also altered, as is Joshua Christopher's; his story ends up petering out towards the conclusion, whereas in the manga he remained important right up to the end. This isn't the jarring change you might expect, but it doesn't exactly carry as much weight, either. 
As mentioned before, it's the love between Rosette and Chrono that really makes this series strong, and their most tender moments together are the series' most powerful. Episodes 18 and 24 in particular moved me greatly and brought tears to my eyes. Special praise should go to Tomoko Kawakami, who plays Rosette. She brings the character to life in ways that even the animation couldn't. There is not a single flaw anywhere in her performance. Whether she is expressing happiness, anger, sadness or any other emotion, we believe her completely. 
Don't allow the religious imagery or elements keep you from giving this series a try. There is a lot here to recommend, from a good, moving story to beautiful, cinema-quality animation. Of course, I would also recommend reading the manga as well; the story, as I said, is different and the manga's ending is so powerful it is certain to bring a lump to the throat at the very least. I had to wait a long time to watch the anime, but I must say: the wait was worth it.

    I decided to write another review on Chrno Crusade because my last one wasn't very good for me and considering this is one of my top two favorite anime of all time, I thought it deserved something better. 
For the general, loose synopsis, Chrno Crusade is about a young girl named Rosette Christopher, who makes a contract with a demon named Chrno that cannot access his true powers anymore due to reasons in the past and together they are attempting to find Rosette's brother, Joshua, who had something extremely horrible happen to him in the past and he went missing. Rosette works with a church as a demon exorcist but has Chrno, a demon himself, as her partner. Generally, the church looks down upon this, but since Chrno is an exceptionally sweet guy and Rosette will not part with him, he is allowed to be around. 
From the outside Chrno Crusade just appears to be a story about a girl, her demon partner and them hunting down demons, but the story inside of that is much deeper and an epic 'crusade' through time, through Heaven and Hell, across the land and with amazing and interesting characters laced into everything. 
The story overall is one of my favorites - I love everything about it from the setting - the early 1900s and revolving around the Catholic Church and their obsessions with demons and artifacts, the clothes they wore, the weapons they use, the different demons and devils they encounter to the actual story itself, with Rosette, Chrno and her missing brother that she loves dearly. 
The villain is overall one of the most evil villains in anything and has a plan that would destroy most of the world and he cares not for who he uses, hurts, and kills in the process, as long as he gets his way. 
The main characters, Chrno and Rosette are among my favorites - Chrno is my favorite guy. His normal form, a 12 year old demon, is absolutely adorable and sweet, who is extremely caring and loving, but when in his true form, a sinning devil, he is the most amazing character, ever. He is loyal, loving and would do anything for Rosette and you know this from the beginning of the entire story. 
A lot of people call Rosette whiny, but like a lot of other shows, she often makes light of things that would otherwise be viewed as extremely dark and dismal because you need some relief in your life, when you're living the way they do. 
The voices in Japanese are amazing, too - Chrno's voice actor became my favorite of all time due to Chrno and still is to this day. Rosette makes me giddy, too, since she does a voice of a special character in my favorite anime of all time, as well as Chrno Crusade. The music is exceptional, too, fitting very well into the time period, but mixing in the fantasy and demonic attributes, as well. 
Chrno Crusade is an outrageous story of love and loyalty, Heaven and Hell and should not be missed by anyone that wants to be moved as much as any show can move you, and who wants to experience a truly deep and meaningful storyline, with wonderful and real characters.

    Apart from the few high-tension moments that come in the latter episodes this anime really has nothing that merits recommendation. It's a good enough series to watch if you are bored....or you have the type of job where you could watch this to while away the hours. 
 ART/ANIMATION  
Art/Animation was done by a big budget company, Gonzo, which usually means there isn't going to be anything lacking by way of animation. I would assume this would be considered a period piece [since it takes place in the 1920s] and as such, a lot of the artistic design was from or inspired from that era: the cars, civilian clothing, scenery and buildings. Movements and high-tension moments, like, car chases and fight scenes were all very smooth and realistic. The only thing I really liked animationwise was the ending sequence. 
SOUNDS 
The ending song I really liked it. It was very beautiful and melacholy at the same time. The OP was not to bad either. However Azamaria's singing....tho quite lovely, totally annoyed me for some reason, it just didn't look real or that it would come from her. Why is there an echo coming from her voice like she is singing in a great hall.....eventho she's outside? Other than that I have no complaints, the voice acting was great as was the sound effects. 
STORY  
The storyline was not put together well, this could have really been one of those 12 ep. shows. The basic premise of this show is that of a young, reckless and impetuous nun her cute sidekicks, a meek, angelic apostle and a once powerful but now somewhat inhibited demon, go searching for her missing brother battling all sorts of evil along the way.......hilarity supposedly ensues. Yet, I never find this show as funny they maybe wanted it to be and most jokes seem to fall flat and fizzle. With some of the earlier episodes, it was such a yawnfest, at times I found it so boring that I found other projects to do, such as begin writing this review and scrubbing my toilet. It's not as if I was totally lost on what the creators were trying to achieve with this story and the whole church aspect but somehow, in this series, the whole idea/concept of gun-toting nuns and demon-banishing clergymen seem forced or just overall silly with a lot of religious catholic symbolitry being tossed about with no real meaning behind it. It did make for one heckuva battle scene in the later episodes, however. But it just didn't make sense, the story could have been the same...if not better in my opinion if they were regular clerics instead of warrior-nuns. Religious animes are a tricky affair but sometimes they work out really well like for example Trinity Blood or having a rogue monk like Saiyuki's Sanzo, it seemed &ldquo;believable&rdquo; or to at least fit neatly within the storyline as opposed to just being thrown into the mix. 
 CHARACTERS  
I had no particular affinity for any of the characters in this show, which is a rare thing to happen for me, I usually get bonded to at least ONE character very quickly. However with this show, I found these characters so insincere, unreal and even cookie-cutter[ish]. I can't place my finger on one singular reason why they appeared that way to me but one reason could be the randomness of their emotions..... one minute she's teary-eyed then the next minute she's yelling and the scene is supposed to be funny. The Demon-kid seems emotionless for the most part&mdash;and I don't think it was supposed to be intentional, and Angel/Apostle-girl seemed too cutesy and 2-Dimentional personalitywise..With Character Design, again nothing too unique and a lot of the clothing of the principal characters seemed out of touch with the times [what grown woman wears a giant yellow bow at the end of her hair?] also modding a nun's gear and habit for battle with humongous splits running down the sides and garters seemed......NOT right. 
 ENJOYMENT  
I don't know how to feel about this show. I want to say that it was bad....that it sucked and maybe overall it kinda did. However, it does have it's awesome moments like the Demon Battle scene, which was out of this world. But a few good scenes can't carry a show. And there were just too much conflict and contradictions: Biblical facts v. Science Fiction and then you have the past [the 1920s] mixed with futuristic elements. The creators bit off more than they could chew with this story I think or maybe too many random ideas...I'm surprized someone didn't throw in a headless Indian running around with a tomahawk. 
It isn't something I'd watch again if I had the choice and I can't recommend it without letting the viewer know what they are in for.

    I was proven wrong again. I am appalled at how much I get wrong impressions, but then again it&rsquo;s fun to be pleasantly surprised when I find out that the anime I thought was going to be bad, ends up to be something spectacular and memorable.  
My first impression was that the show is too serious, and since I don&rsquo;t like serious themes, I probably won&rsquo;t like it. I was wrong &ndash; I LOVE IT! I even overlooked the blasphemy since it rocked. It was funny when it needed to be funny, it was cute when I needed to go &ldquo;awww&hellip;&rdquo; It had high energy when I looked for some action. Thank God (no pun intended) my first impression was so wrong. 
I love the characters. Rosette was cool &ndash; she was so brave and a bit inspiring. She didn&rsquo;t waste her time at all, and she was always trying to help out. Then there&rsquo;s Chrno. What a cutie. I love how hard he tries to be accepted. The Chrno &ndash; Rosette love match was weird at first, because a) Chrno&rsquo;s a demon. b) The height difference. c) The age difference (Although at first I was going for a Chrno &ndash; Azmaria love match.. I have a sick mind, I know). Despite that, it worked out in the end, since their love for each other was at a different level. I also like Azmaria. She&rsquo;s just so adorable, and so pretty and well designed too. And then there&rsquo;s Joshua &ndash; woah! Hottie alert. Too bad he&rsquo;s under age and a bit of a retard.  
The drawing style was ok. It wasn&rsquo;t bad, it wasn&rsquo;t great. It was acceptable. There was nothing new about it but it was just alright. Chrno&rsquo;s design was ok, but something about him wasn&rsquo;t right. He&rsquo;s still cute though. The villains looked cool too &ndash; they were well designed. Speaking of the villains, generally the fight scenes are ok and actually quite exciting.I like the colors &ndash; but sometimes too much blue and brown just sickens me. I know it&rsquo;s in the 1920s and I guess they didn&rsquo;t have much color then (Did that last comment make sense at all?) but more or less the colors were balanced. I also like how they used CG effects. It made it look more interesting and modern. It complemented the high energy of the story.  
The music had a western feel to it, at least for the BGM. That was another reason why I hesitated watching it because I hate western themes. It grew on me after a few episodes since I realized that the music did match the feel of the scenes, and it really improved the scenes. I really like the opening scene too &ndash; again, it matched the anime. I think it was called pleasure line or something like that. It was really well made, it even had violins to complement it. The ending song was just touching. It kinda hinted that the series was going to end in a really sad way, but it was still beautiful and delicate (remind me never to use the word delicate again)  
I am just so happy to have watched a really good anime. I know it isn&rsquo;t perfect, it&rsquo;s not as popular as other series out there (And I would personally liked it better with less unecessary fan service - she's a nun you know), but what I got out of it is just so special. It really touched my heart (I&rsquo;m a sap, I know) and it&rsquo;s definitely one of my favorites now.

    This is a short review. This is basically a very driven girl trying to save her brother from being manipulated by the forces of hell. She is a sister in a branch of a military-church sort of deal, and her best friend is a devil. The plot is very interesting, including the questions towards God's involvement, death, and devils, and you can tell that every episode is somehow relating to the overall picture. My only qualm with this amazing anime would be the accent for the &quot;Jewel Witch&quot; (Satella). Being a German and speaking fluent German, and knowing my parents' accents with English... i'd have to say that she's actually closer to Transylvania and Hungarian than German. But that's only the English dubbed. I saw the SUBBED version, too, and enjoyed the Japanese actress's pronunciation of most of the German words.  
STORY- 10 
Because of the originality (in a sense) and the religious undertones that make you question things intently, and because the character development is very, very intrepid. This has one of the most meaningful story arcs that i have ever come across. Every single episode means something. Making you empathize with a character, understand them, or even pity them. Even though there are flashback sequences that can sometimes be confusing, as long as you pay to the subbed dates, you will enjoy this series more than any other 24 episode anime, i guarantee it. 
ART- 10 
Beautiful. The action sequences use the &quot;shaky camera&quot; effect, but not to an overdose such as certain animes i have watched. The colors are always fitting for each of the episodes, and the blood is all the more gruesome with the contrast between the scenes 
SOUND - 8 
I LOVED the music. The openings and endings were amazing, i watched each and every one (i usually skip), but the music was captivating and well suited for the genre. The ending theme (for the last ep) was utterly perfect, too. Well-sung. 
CHARACTER - 9 
The contrast of character personalities makes this an a-typical anime. The main protagonist being a female with a very outspoken and agressive personality, the main male protagonist being very drawn back and selfless, and side characters that make you believe that there's either faith in humanity or lose your faith in humanity. The development is amazing too, you see between each episode a character grow stronger, or weaker, and the comparison is there. 
ENJOYMENT - 10 
This is one of those animes you can't stop watching. Just looking at the preview for the next episode makes you want to say &quot;Eh... i'll go to bed at 11:30pm tonight.&quot; Then, the next previews make you watch another episode, etc. By the time you've pulled an all-nighter you're still fulfilled and energized to watch the next, and call in a sick day to work. 
Overall - 10 
I have finally completed the entire series, and i have to say, this has the most meaningful ending and perfect flow that makes Chrno Crusade one of the only animes that has PERFECT length and timing. This has amazing art, amazing characters, and an amazing message. One of the things lacking from most anime now is the artistic value and philosophical value. Sure, it's nice to have a good laugh every now and then, but if you're looking for a great series with characters that are funny, deep and intriguing, look no further. Chrno Crusade is a great series. 
Enjoy! 
TIP!!!!! 
I enjoyed watched the subbed versions better, and have all together stopped watching the dubbed versions. There are too many scenes where the laughable accent of Satella has gotten in my way. Though i do love Rosette's dubbed voice,  i had to part ways with it.

    Originally written by Daisuke Moriyama, Chrno Crusade (sometimes translated to Chrono) is an excellent action anime, that is possibly the saddest one I've ever seen. 
I created this review, because unlike the one other CC review, I've seen the whole thing, and I appreciate it. Sooo, here's my opinion. 
Story  
Rosette Christopher, and her little brother, Joshua, two little orphan children, are exploring, when they come across a mysterious cave. Within, a devil named Chrno was living, but the two young children befriend Chrno easily. 
One day, Joshua is driven insane by the powers he had already had, and the horns on Chrno, given to him by Aion, and puts all the other children of the orphange into a temporal stasis, where they are frozen for four years. Aion than takes Joshua away, as one of the 7 apostiles. 
Rosette, devestated by the loss of her brother, makes a contract with Chrno. She is given a mysterious time-piece, where when she opens it, Chrno feeds off her soul to gain power. 
As Rosette and Chrno try to find her brother again, Rosettes life is ticking away from her pack with the devil. 
Animation  
There is something I love about this animation, I can' even explain it. Unlike a lot of other action anime, this one does not cut corners with the shakey-screen effect. It's beautifully designed, with vibrant colours, and flows so nicely. I can't even explain it, as I said earlier. The best animation is definitly in the opening sequence, though. 
Sound  
Again, I just love the music. It's hard to explain. The ending and opening fit the series so well, it's perfect. The music within the series is awesome, with it fitting every scene perfectly. I especially love one of the songs, that usually occurs after commerical breaks in the first few episodes. It gives off a very mystery/horror sound, which I feel the series has a bit of, deep down. 
Character  
I love the characters. All but one.  
Chrno was my personal favourite. He is a cute little devil, but can change into his awesome true form. He is such a nice little thing, and I can't possibly see anyone not liking him.  
Rosette, while being a typical annoying female, I still loved. She is emotional, yes, but she's not helpless like so many other leads. For the first few episodes, she is doing the majority of the fighting. Of course, towards the end, she gets a bit helpless, but it's not like she didn't try!  
I like Azmaria, for some odd reason. Just a cute little girl that admires Rosette. And I swear, that song she sings, I've hear somewhere... J 
oshua was so adorable as a child, and just cool as a nut-job.  
Aoin was pretty neat, having more layers than the ""I want to destory the world"" thing.  
The only character I wasn't fond of Satella, and it was probably because I watched it in English, and I could barely understand her accent. It hurt. 
Enjoyment  
I watched this series in 3 days. I couldn't pull away. When I wasn't watching it, I was thinking about it. I was obsessed. I was Chrno Crusade sick. When I finished it, I cried. The ending was sad, and it was over, so I cried. Than I went to work, and I told everyone about this awesome anime I discovered. I proudly told them all I cried. I hummed the theme, until I went home. I am listening to the theme now. 
I think that could qualify as I enjoyed greatly. 
Overall / My Comments / My Feelings  
I love this series, and I've owned it for 4 days, so far. I am a sad, sad girl. The ending was such a depressingly happy ending, that I cried. Sure, they... umm..  
Anyways, I highly recommend this series. I love it for reasons unknown (maybe just Chrno? He is named after a game I love...) but anyways, I suck terribly at explaining the story, but believe me, it was awesome. Awesome, I say. Go out and buy this series, don't just download it. It needs to be enjoyed from your cozy couch, where you can cry into some blankets.

    Reviewer&rsquo;s Brief Notables:  I know that most people often don&rsquo;t trust or are a little skeptical about a Perfect 10 review, but that is, without any exaggeration, how I feel about Chrno Crusade. 
______________________________________________________________ 
I first watched Chrno Crusade without any expectations for it whatsoever. After completing the first episode (weeks before I completed the series), I wasn&rsquo;t really fascinated with it at all. For the time, I just thought this anime was pretty generic and somewhat dull. 
I was wrong. 
After a few weeks, I was led to completing the series. To make the most general and the most appropriate statement: It was captivating! The story behind Chrno Crusade is very intricate with numerous characters, subplots and details.  The story is brilliantly put together with no holes in the story and also a very complete ending (sniffles). Chrno Crusade is full of action, comedy and romance; the key ingredients of a great production. The general plot is nothing unordinary and is usually played out as other anime have, but there is just something about this anime that I thought really set this one apart from the others. Unfortunately, I am unsure of the reason myself; or am not able to explain it in words. As you watch Chrno Crusade, I am sure you will understand what I mean.  &ndash;and I apologize for the slightly unclear story briefing. 
As for the art in Chrno Crusade, it would have to say that it is brilliant! The art gave me a very strong sense of familiarity. The animation is very similar to many series&rsquo; such as Full Metal Panic and Kaze no Stigma because they&rsquo;re from the same animators. The kind of animation that Gonzo offers is my all time favorite. Everything is greatly detailed accurate lighting and shading. Skin tones look very natural and give the characters physical depth (they don&rsquo;t look so 2-demensional), and best of all, the character&rsquo;s eyes aren&rsquo;t the size of my monitor. In the series, there are barely any CG and most of the time, it&rsquo;s very unnoticeable. 
Most of the time, I prefer subtitles over dubbing because usually the English voice actors talk like they&rsquo;ve been deprived from their souls; emotionless and doubtable. In the case of Chrno Crusade, I very much enjoyed the English dubbing. One, because the voice actor for Rosette talked very fast and her pitch was very high (much like Excel from Excel Saga). Second, because my favorite English seiyuu, Hilary Haag (Teletha &ldquo;Tessa&rdquo; Testarossa from Full Metal Panic) was acting for Rosette. And lastly, because the series is set in America it would make more sense for it to be in English. The dubbing included uses of slang back in the late 1920&rsquo;s which was when the series takes place. As for the opening song, it was very enjoyable and blended well with the opening animation that also suited the anime flawlessly. And the ending song&hellip;well, quickly became one of my favorites (it is actually playing on repeat as I write this review). Entitled &ldquo;Sayonara Solitaire&rdquo;, the song expresses feelings of sadness, loneliness and hope. The animation for the ending was beautiful too. The ambience of the ripples gave an awkward feeling of loneliness and at the end of the credits; the animation showed the watch that Rosette bore as a drop of water ran down from it while the ending song was closing with a small string orchestra. Having thought of that drop was a tear and by the knowledge of what that watch really represented in addition to the sad music made it easy for the viewer to cry. That short section at the end also gave a hint of foreshadowing that was just even sadder to accept. SAD but not depressing; which is all I can say. 
What I thought while watching Chrno Crusade was that the real essence of this series were the characters. Character development is a strongpoint in this anime and the process of it takes on most of the series itself. Each character is unique in their own way; even for the supporting characters. They all have their own personality and individuality. That effort from the producers made a real difference for me. The cast in Chrno Crusade are all affable; even the villain. Rosette (awkwardly) reminds me of Naruto. They are optimistic, earnest, hard-working, and both have the drive and potential to reach their ambitions. Rosette was just so lively and full of energy which made watching the series more or less pleasant. Chrono is depicted to be a very modest, kind and selfless character though he is a devil. Rosette and Chrono&rsquo;s relationship are like of best friends if not more. They are both very close to each other, not hesitating a second to protect one another. Their partnering gives off such a deep feeling of fulfillment in your heart. They are both lovable and enjoyable to watch which makes the ending of the series even more melancholic. 
Chrno Crusade has quickly and easily made it into my top anime list. At first, as I&rsquo;ve stated, I wasn&rsquo;t really fascinated with it. Until a few weeks later, I found myself completing the whole series in less than a day. Every episode was captivating as I watched one right after another. There were a few episodes where it felt as if it were a filler, but I thought it was good to have a few fillers here and there to take a break from the story. Character development was not something I expected from Chrno Crusade, but it turned out to be my favorite point of the series. The rating I gave for Chrno Crusade went from an Eight out of Ten to a Ten out of Ten during the last two episodes. These two episodes are notorious for making viewers cry. Honestly, I cried for about 10 minutes straight; coming from a guy who hasn&rsquo;t cried like that in over 5 years. The last episode had such an astounding impact and because of that, Chrno Crusade had earned the right to be on my favorites. This series has been very memorable and also very rewatchable.  It is PERFECT. 
I recommend anyone to watch Chrno Crusade. From the average otaku to an early anime watcher, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this series. If you plan to watch it, at least watch the first 3 episodes. Do not do the same mistake I have and nearly dropped it on the first episode; which I deeply regret doing. Give it a try.

    I love Steel Angel Kurumi, so of course I wanted to watch all the rest of the anime series that went with it. This was definitely one that could be skipped. SAK Zero is a prequel, but it feels more like an AU series. I'm glad this was only 3 episodes because I don't think I could have handled any more.

    Wha?? That was pretty much how I felt throughout the entirety of Steel Angel Kurumi Zero. Having watched all of the Steel Angel Kurumi series up until this point, I was expecting yet another nonsensical romantic comedy that may or may not be about girl on girl action, but instead I was treated to something much different. Steel Angel Kurumi Zero is a flat out romantic drama. Yes, that�s right, Steel Angel Kurumi Zero isn�t a comedy at all. Shocked? I know I was. Once it set in that Zero was a dramatic anime I was able to somewhat enjoy it, but when it was all said and done I couldn�t find much reason to praise it. This isn�t saying Zero is a bad installment to an enjoyable series, but I just found Zero to be so unique and different from the rest of the series that it felt entirely out of place, and maybe that�s exactly what they were aiming for. All of the Steel Angel gang is back, but this time they have matured quite a bit. Saki is basically the mother figure of the household, giving Kurumi advice and taking care of everyone. Karinka is still bratty, but a lot more tolerable. Kurumi received the biggest personality change though, turning her into a down to earth (albeit emotional) young girl, which consequently made her a lot less interesting to watch. Kurumi was always portrayed as this fun eccentric robot maid girl who didn�t love anyone except for her master, but now it�s as though she�s a normal everyday girl who can fall in love with whoever she wants. And that spunky attitude? Gone. This puts an interesting twist on the Steel Angel Kurumi universe, and has me wondering if there is more to the story than meets the eye.  
Steel Angel Kurumi Zero is a tale about love and how much of a struggle it can sometimes be, but there is clearly a bigger plot swirling around underneath it all. What it is, exactly, isn�t something I can put my finger on. Steel Angel Kurumi Zero seems to have some fairly strong philosophical undertones, and the extremely strange--almost biblical--ending supports this theory. One problem I had with Steel Angel Kurumi Zero was that its short length made it hard for me to understand the potentially interesting storyline to the fullest. The anime didn�t make many things clear, and simply used visual markers and character expressions to help emphasize some of the bigger plot points. This doesn�t work too well in my opinion, and once it�s all done and over with you�ll probably be left with a lot of questions that seemingly have no answer. For instance, what is a �Holder� and what do Angels have to do with it? I have made plenty assumptions as to what a Holder might be, but I can�t be sure if any of them are right because the anime doesn�t take the time to explain it. From the way Zero describes it, I think a Holder sounds like nothing more than a person suffering from clinical depression, but it�s obviously a much bigger deal than that. The term Gamma is also used without explanation, and is only said to be the one thing that can cure a Holder. So, does that make Kurumi a Gamma? I don�t know, so don�t ask. 
Steel Angel Kurumi Zero is about as short in length as they come. Sticking to the old ways, each episode is only fifteen minutes long. This makes it one of the shortest animes I�ve ever seen, and easy to squeeze into your schedule. One thing I should mention though is that Steel Angel Kurumi Zero takes place in the same room for the entire running time. This could bug the hell out of Kurumi fans and sci-fi fans alike who want to see more of the futuristic outside world. The only thing that bugged me though, was how little the new girl�s character got developed. Excelia seemed like a rather interesting female computer nerd that I wouldn�t mind getting to know more about, but sadly there wasn�t enough time to even give her a proper introduction. 
If there is one thing I loved about Steel Angel Kurumi Zero it was the music. I�ve always been a big fan of piano melodies, and Zero is full of them. The music throughout the series can only be described as beautiful. The ending theme (Miracle's Start) is strangely uplifting, and at times I found myself helplessly humming along to it. Since Zero is currently unlicensed outside of Japan I had to settle for the Japanese audio, and mostly due to Kurumi�s new attitude I preferred it this way. The animation in Steel Angel Kurumi Zero is also pretty good, but doesn�t take much advantage of the futuristic setting. Since the entire anime takes place in the apartment during cloudy skies, you can forget all about the colorful palettes that Steel Angel Kurumi is famous for. This works perfectly for the kind of anime Zero is though, so you can�t very well knock it down because of it. Character designs are essentially the same as before, but with the trademark costumes gone it�s easy to feel like you�re looking at a totally new cast of characters. 
While watching Steel Angel Kurumi Zero I was reminded of the movie Bicentennial Man. When watching a series like Steel Angel Kurumi and seeing time progress hundreds of years with the Steel Angels being the only cast members to remain, you have to wonder how much loss Kurumi, Saki and Karinka have had to deal with over the span of their lives. By the time of Zero, everyone that they�ve encountered previously is dead. Nakahito, Nako, and everyone that had a significant role in their lives are nothing more than memories. These three girls will be forced to walk the Earth practically forever as everyone they love or come close to dies over and over again. Depressing? I�d say so, and maybe that�s why I had no choice but to respect the new dramatic tone that Steel Angel Kurumi Zero was sporting, even if the anime itself wasn�t nearly as good as its predecessors. After the first episode I had chills. After the second episode I had goose bumps. After the third episode, however, I had a headache. Steel Angel Kurumi Zero works well as an atmospheric anime that gives you a feeling that�s hard to duplicate, but when it comes to storytelling and answering questions it fails miserably. As a stand-alone anime, Zero isn�t even worth watching on your lunch break. Unless you�re a huge fan of Steel Angel Kurumi, I see little reason to check out Steel Angel Kurumi Zero. It�s not a horrible anime, but it serves little purpose by itself and to the Kurumi series.  
My Score: 6.0

 Steel Angel Kurumi Zero is the final installment of the Kurumi story. Kurumi season 1 is in the Past, Kurumi 2 is in the Present, and Kurumi Zero is in the (distant) future. 
It's got something very unique that sets it apart from the rest of the Kurumi series: Subtlety. 
Zero takes place far, far in the future, where humans' ability to adapt to a increasingly harsh climate is getting worse at a rapid rate. Various people become ""Holders"", where their body completely gives up on being conscious, and eventually dies. The sweet little Kurumi happens to fall in love with a guy, who then becomes a Holder shortly after the two start dating. 
The story seems overly simple at first. The artwork is very simple, outfits and backdrop as well. The plot is essentially dialogue-driven. There is very simple music, and a cute little ending theme sung by Rie Tanaka (but no opening theme, sigh). The mood is a little bleak (acid rain can do that...), dramatic, and a calm-before-the-storm feel to it. It lacks the comedy, fighting, sci-fi, and yuri elements of the other series. 
What's fascinating about this is its role in the complete Kurumi story. It is chronologically at the very end, far in the future, at mankind's last days of survival. This is ""Zero"", though, the actual beginning of the story. The three characters, Kurumi, Saki, and Karinka, are not yet Steel Angels; this is where they begin, as human girls. Kurumi's hope is smiled upon by an angel, and her Angel Heart blooms. 
The unseen happenings after this OVA are the girls' transformation to Steel Angels and subsequent trip back in time, to the time period of the first Steel Angel Kurumi series. This is why it's ""Zero"", it's the backstory of where Kurumi's hope and power came from, why, and what kind of bleak situation they came from (though demons hadn't appeared yet). As a testament to this eventual time travel, the end of Zero is a short picture of Kurumi hugging Nakahito from season 1. 
I found it interesting to see the girls in their ""natural habitat"". It appears that Karinka was originally not as crazy or violent as she is in seasons 1 and 2, once she's become a Steel Angel. Saki is proper as always, and seems to care a great deal for Kurumi, but she doesn't seem to be in love with her quite yet. It would have been nice to have this be 6 episodes rather than 3, to see more of the connection between Zero and 1, and maybe see some Saki/Kurumi romance begin. 
I give this a 8 of 10 because I loved it, the story was just the right depth, it completed the Kurumi story to a good extent (not perfect), but, it was majorly simple, short, and could have had more content.

    I found out about Steel Angel Kurumi Zero after having seen the entire US DVD release of the anime, and after having read a significant portion of the manga.  Needless to say, I was excited to find out that Zero contained my favorite character from the manga, Excelia.  I eagerly downloaded the fansubs, hoping I'd get to see her in action. 
What did I get?  Well, definitely not what I expected.  First and foremost, the point of view never leaves the apartment that they live in.  That rather disappointed me. 
Second, no action whatsoever.  It's just a straight up drama.  This could be enjoyable to some, and the original did have some drama in it, but it contained so much more comedy and action to balance it out that Zero simply lacks. 
Third, Excelia isn't at all like she is in the manga.  She's basically in Zero in name only.  Not much of a point, but given that she's my favorite Steel Angel from the manga, it's kind of a letdown. 
Actually, that sums it up perfectly.  Steel Angel Kurumi Zero is kind of a letdown.

    Romeo X Juliet 
Synopsis: 
The story is an excessively exaggerated remake of the popular Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet filled with happiness, strife, an ambitious evil emperor, and the drive for love. The plot itself is about two lovers who were never meant to be together because of their opposing families, but love cannot keep them apart. They will find a way to live together even if it means defying their family name. 
Besides the beautiful story line, I did have a few pet peeves with the overall style of the anime. Yes, the action can be intense at times with sword-to-sword battle, but being allowed to jump/fall from the top of building and still land perfectly is beyond realism. It's great that we don't have to watch the main characters sit in a hospital for numerous episodes, but seriously not even bearing a scratch or bruise.. it's too much for me to bear. It hurts me to see those things.  
There are other story elements that I'll try not to judge too harshly such as hosting a wedding in the middle of wartime immediately after the commander stating that the soldiers are prepared to go to war. Things like this are what is allowed in animation, and I'll leave it to you if you think that's okay, but it lacks a realistic scenario. 
It's really hard to judge this anime harshly while listening to the opening song on repeat.  
And now with the ratings: 
Story - 6 - Numerous elements of the story line were flipped from the original Shakespeare story, as if the director was given a list of names to include in the play with a very vague memory of what was suppose to happen. 
Graphics - 8 - Pretty modern graphics here. Nothing too exciting. Very bright colours. Most everything was in high quality, but few things were finely detailed. 
Sound - 7 - Touching music at certain points, but I never felt totally enthralled at any moment due to the killer situational musical atmosphere. 
Character personas - 7 - The mad king was played very well and the old english dialect kept me smiling.  Otherwise, Romeo and Juliet just weren't exciting.   
Overall - 6 - When I think about it, it all boils down to the entire play lacking humour, detailed action scenes, and witty commentary, which are all very compelling human characteristics to be missing. 
Recommended - I kind of got the 'meh' feel from this new remake. It had it's moments, but they were few and far between. In a hard answer, I would have to say, ""No, I would recommend a different anime with more depth.""

    Romeo x Juliet, is it Romeo and Juliet? no. 
This anime is based very loosely on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet so, if you happen to be familiar with the English classic (most of us are) prepare to be surprised. 
If you've seen the 2004 film Troy (starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom) it may be easier for you to understand the premise of the story - how an inspiration becomes a legend.  
Romeo x Juliet follows two young nobles Romeo, the son of the despotic Montague Ruler and Juliet, the only surviving daughter of the slaughtered Capulet family, come to grips with their identity, love and society around them and what the struggles that they take when trying to instigate change. 
While the setting is nice, those of you who are turned off by high fantasy be warned. Like the sword of akashe in Code Geass, there were some things that i just didn't get the first time through and if this is not your thing, know that it is present. I would've given the story an 8 if it weren't for this. 
Characters are what i feel really bring a story to life in anime and personally, the characters in romeo x Juliet really took a while to grow on me.  
A key element in the story of this anime is the growth of romeo and juliet from young naive youths into capable and responsible adults. While their development eventually fleshes out their characters, this did make the first few episodes really hard to press through for me. 
The side characters also fulfilled their roles capably, although i did wish for more fleshed out backstories, so don't expect Angel beats.  
The art in Romeo x Juliet is very... clean. If you like anime in general, you should have nothing to complain about Romeo x Juliet. One thing that i did notice was that, the artwork did not have any of the hyper-sexualisation present in a lot of anime that I've seen lately. None of the characters are particularly 'hot' in my opinion, but all of them have a nice simple artwork that doesn't scream big-boobs or fan service but allows down-to-earth characters and human personalities to shine through. 
The voice actors all do a fairly good job and sound believable although the hyper 'Willy' William Shakespeare may be slightly annoying at times.  
Appropriate music highlights some of the more epic or moving moments in the show, building a nice environment that really had me immersed in some of the more touching moments of the show. 
Final verdict: 
My friend recommended this show to me and i was skeptical at first,  but give the show a go and you might be surprised.

    When I originally stumbled across Romeo x Juliet about a year ago now, I passed it by thinking that it would be another corny remake of the original story with basically the same story as every other Romeo and Juliet out there. It was out of boredom that I decided to watch it recently, but I had no expectations of actually enjoying it. How wrong I was proved. 
Overall the anime was beautifully written and the spin on Romeo and Juliet was very well done, with many surprising twist that will keep the viewer interested. Juliet's character was well developed and notably was a strong heroine figure; something that is refreshing to see. Though the art wasn't too much to my complete liking (a bit simplistic for my taste), the story made up for it and kept my interest (admitted there were a few dry episodes in the middle but both the beginning and ending make up for those one or two episodes). I would recommend that people who like romance and a bit of action as well as a some angst watch this. It's well worth it.  
Though I would suggest that you make sure you have a box of tissues with you at the end if you're prone to crying easily.

    Let me start off by saying that Romeo x Juliet as an anime is far too good for me. This anime in all aspects should be regarded as a masterpiece. This anime is the perfect example of taking a story that has impacted human history, and change things around to make it your own take on it. Romeo x Juliet takes one of William Shakespeare's most famous plays, and does something with it in a way we've never seen before. This is your typical story of two star crossed lovers who do what ever they can to be with each other and either one or both of them dies. Not only that, but this anime also pays an homage to other Shakespeare plays such as Two Men of Verona, and MacBeth, and even uses Shakespeare himself as a supporting character The animation was done by Studio Gonzo. The studio behind such series as Desert Punk, Black Cat, Afro Samurai, and Basilisk. Romeo x Juliet I think has their best animation by far. Animation on par with Hellsing Ultimate, and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. While the music and acting are just your typical anime music and acting I don't think it's bad in this case. There's only so much you can do with that. Onto the characters. Both Romeo and Juliet in this anime are in the same character as they are in the play where as Supporting characters such as Amelia and Marqucio are just standard cliche anime supporting characters. Lord Montegue on the other hand is hands down one of the most thrilling villains I have ever seen in any anime out there. He was so evil, so cunning, and so maniacal, I'm surprised he was made by Gonzo of all people. I enjoyed this anime so much I watched it over the course of a week. I just couldn't put it down. Over all this is by far one of Studio Gonzo's best, and to date the most beautiful anime I've ever seen.

    Oddly, when I looked it up, some of the cliches made it look very interesting, for whatever reason: a bad dude has massacred a family except for one girl who must learn how to fight and plan to take him over, while she struggles with a love. Meanwhile, there's this dude who's on her side, more or less, but isn't anywhere near as pure-hearted as her and has a much more troubling personal history. What's not to like, right? Well, once I started watching it, it didn't feel that exciting. 
Story: It's not at all like the Shakespeare show. The only real similarity is the retention of Romeo and Juliet names, and the fact that they're from opposing families; they both die, but it's not even with a double suicide. However, if you forget this fact, it's mildly entertaining; the characters are cute and their wanderings at least give something to focus on. It is, however, nothing special; there are a lot of cliches and the characters aren't much good. 
Art: The art is, actually, pretty good; Neo Verona is a very attractive city; particularly worthy of notice is Montague's palace, which has beautifully-rendered halls, courtyard, and more. All the other locations also are nicely-done, and seem very earnest; the mines really look like mines and the abandoned village really looks like an abandoned village. Characters are very cute, with big Honey-and-Clover style eyes, and some have very interesting stylistic points: it can be a sight to see, watching Juliet's hair cascade down every time she removes that wig of hers. Although they are realistic overall, a few of the characters seem color-coded: Juliet's hair and clothes are red; Romeo's are blue; Mercutio's are green; Tybalt's are black, etc. 
Sound: The sound is nothing special. The background music is not worth focusing on, the OP is subpar compared to those of other anime (particularly Fullmetal Alchemist and Death Note), and the closings are terrible; I mostly didn't even bother to sit through them to see the scenes from the next episode! 
Characters: Okay, the weakest point of the show. Although the characters are cute, they are really not very well-done at all! My first hint of this came from what the show did to Benvolio. Benvolio is really clueless and stupid; he doesn't even know how to use a broom! It was awhile after when I realized that he wasn't the only one like that; Romeo was no smarter (he gets sent to a mine and farms while Juliet risks her neck). Even Juliet, who is arguably the main character, is an idiot: she keeps getting in trouble and getting rescued by Curio (etc.) or Tybalt, and doesn't emerge triumphant in any undertakings. In fact, the only truly interesting characters are Tybalt and Mercutio. Tybalt gets to have a lot of the action, and Mercutio's ambition and the horrors he faces as a result are well documented. However, they are the only exceptions to the rule that most of the characters are stupid and hard to enjoy; in fact, I may be rare to even like Mercutio! 
Enjoyment: As I said before, the show is mildly entertaining on days off. However, compared to other anime, it is nothing special, and is in fact much less enjoyable. I find I enjoy parodies of this show more than the show itself. 
Although I did enjoy watching the show, it is not a very good show. I am not a Shakespeare purist and was not expecting a show faithful to the Shakespeare; however, Romeo X Juliet is mediocre even if the fact that it draws from Shakespeare in any kind of way is overlooked. In fact, with stupid characters, a subpar plot, and very little else, it almost seems absurd that the show could take itself so seriously!

    I had mixed feelings about watching this anime because of the title and I thought it would just be another drama romance that drags everything out. 
I was most definitely wrong, I watched this anime in one sitting and wasn't bored for a second of it. 
Watching as Romeo and Juliet's romance continue made me want to ship them like mad. 
The soundtrack for the series is outstanding and was brilliantly performed. 
The story I have definitely seen in other places but they changed the typical plot for revenge into a exciting romance which I will definitely watch again and buy the dvd.

    Romeo x Juliet it's a master piece. Although its based on the beautiful play by William Shakespeare ""Romeo and Juliet"", it has a fantasy brush to it.  
The story is more than just Romeo and Juliet, the star crossed lovers, it is its characters and how they evolve and struggle through everything that happens along the story line. But surely it does center greatly on Romeo and Juliet's everlasting love.  
The story is outstanding, and I found myself crying, laughing, and feeling joyful every second of the series.  
Story: 10 
The art is the essence of perfection. The beauty of the characters, the breathtaking loveliness of the scenarios and backgrounds, the way everything connected was pure magic. 
Art:10 
The sound was magnificent. The opening song was brilliantly selected, as well as the two closing songs, which reflect well the core of the anime. Every sound, voice and score were majestically woven together to make the story even more extraordinary.  
Sound:10 
The character's are perfection. They are the heart beating strong and loud on this series. The supporting, extra, and antagonist characters are a creation of pure genius. Even more so are the main characters. Romeo and Juliet are more than beautiful, and it's not just because they are Romeo and Juliet themselves but because of the soul and immortal love they share.  
Character:10 
I enjoyed it with all my heart. I am blown away on how animation can touch someone, how it can turn a story into something more. I don't want to say any other thing but the fact I fell in love with this series because of possible spoilers. For me I  believe ten is not enough, maybe infinite. 
Enjoyment:10

    This show is the best thing I've seen recently! I will admit in the beginning this show was a bit slow getting into but as each episode went on, it just got better and better! 
The story is alright, I never saw the original Romeo and Juliet so I can't say how accurate it is to the original story but I still enjoyed it even if I haven't seen the original. I think this is an anime that almost everyone can find something in it. I really like the characters in this version and I think this is the first time I just loved an anime solely because of the characters. These are characters you can react to like Juliet might be my favorite female character in an anime or any media. I really got behind her pacifism and kindness attitude. And then there's my favorite villain in anime Montigue. He's evil but his motivation for being evil is unexpected I just never thought about it. 
As for the art/animation/whatever I think it's okay but it never really wowed me with it's animation. As for the sound I think the music is good but like the animation it never really stood out either however what does stand out is it's excellent English Dub. I know this might sound crazy but I recommend watching the English Dub over Japanese with subtitles.The English dub did something neat and that's adding Ye Olde English to the mix and it's not just a gimmick the delivery of some of the lines are brilliant and adds a lot to the overall experience. 
So yeah it gets 10 from me all around. Except in Art and Sound those get an 8

    THE STAFF 
- Animation is done by a bunch of assholes called studio GONZO. God, I hate them so much, they suck hard in most of what they made. 
- Directed by some nobody called Oizaki Fumitoshi. This guy is not even a director; he is mostly working as an animator and decides to direct only when nobody else is willing to take the job in some shitty show they know it’s going to flop before they even begin to make it. That is why his only jobs is this one, and two crappy lolicon shows titled Ontama and Astarotte no Omocha. 
- Based on Romeo and Juliet, one of the most famous theatre plays of all times, written by William Shakespear, one of the most famous writers in human history, who eats for breakfast almost every other poet and author of modern times. Who can forget his famous story which had flying horses, a female masked avenger, and a magical tree that is about to destroy flying continents? … What, you don’t remember all that in the theatre play? Neither do I. 
Sadly this most amazing love story fell into the wretched hands of those assholes at GONZO and turned it into a fantasy/action mediocrity that has little to no connections to the original story. So let me make it clear that this is not an adaptation of the original story but some piss poor story filled with names from Shakespearian plays as a cheap method to sell to the ignorant who would expect something amazing. Don’t anyone assume this turd of a show is even close to dear old William’s brilliance. It’s a retarded shounen adventure that rips-off names from a much better material and does nothing to improve its immature formula. 
So in the so-called scenario there is this girl who survives the slaughter of her family and turns Zorro against the nobles responsible for that. And she so happens to fall in love with the son of the leader of the rivalling family. Sounds legit. And if you expect to hear sappy dialogues of eternal love, poetry and romance in its purest form, give up because Romeo in this goddamn show is an indecisive lead and Juliet borders a tsundere. Meaning, there are no memorable characters or situations; it all plays out as a typical adventure with typical anime characters. 
The story takes part on a setting filled with flying stuff like islands, horses, dragons, and gives a fairy tale flavour to everything. The production values are not bad as far as backgrounds go but surely lack when the characters deform in many scenes. Voice acting and songs are ok but nothing amazing or memorable. 
The pacing is a mess; it starts nicely in a sappy way and the more it progresses the more things make no sense. Many conflicts are resolved in a very simple way and have no relation to the main story or even to one another. The ending specifically is shit, as it came out of nowhere and ended in a rushed and unexciting way. 
In all it is a passable adventure that shamelessly uses the title of something it is not worthy of even licking its feet. Not recommended. 
And now for some excused scorings.

    On my scale, 10 is the best of the best (S Tier), 9 is outstanding, no faults (A Tier), and 8 is great, very good, outstanding, BUT ... (B Tier).  
Romeo X Juliet was on pace to be a 9 through 16, 18 episodes, and if the ending/story outcome was different could have ended up a 10.  Unfortunately, the ending fell short and left a somewhat sour taste on an otherwise outstanding series.  
Characters were well done, the story is an interesting take on a classic, and the setting adds intrigue.  Not an expert on art/music, but the soundtrack was well done and the art was pleasing. 
Romance between Romeo X Juliet is refreshing- no high school timidness, shyness, inept characters etc.  A mature, adult, if somewhat ""puppy love"" -esque romance.  Juliet is particularly well done, with her character as the Red Whirlwind an outstanding addition.  Romeo is a few notes less complicated, yet still endearing, and his mid season arc with the mines and village definitely helps add some depth and balance to the character.  
I was absolutely loving this anime until the final act, where the insertion of a supernatural element derails what was previously a grounded inspection into humanity, fate, love.  
The closest comparison i can make is when the source material is a light novel or manga that wont see further adaptation other than a single anime season or an abrupt cancellation; the last 2 episodes in particular seem totally out of left field, depart from the tone of the story and present character 'development' which is head scratching.  This is simply inexcusable for an anime where the source material if a completed work of over 500 years; either the planning was glossed over or the execution failed, neither of which is a particularly satisfying explanation.  
Still, all that being said, Romeo X Juliet is an outstanding romance anime which stays mostly clear from common anime tropes, especially for adults who are rather tired of 'classroom' 'shy MC' 'unable to admit his/her feelings MC', or any number of other childish rubbish.  The majority of the series is engaging, interesting and definitely a pleasant viewing experience with a good deal of intrigue.  Depending on your interpretation/expectation/tolerance for supernatural 'deus-ex' type endings, you may have an even better interpretation than I did.   
TLDR:  Outstanding, refreshing and interesting version of Romeo X Juliet, a well done romance/adventure/action/drama.  A must-see for those fatigued or uninterested in standard anime romance.

    This anime was overall outstanding but there are some parts that make you laugh and/or cry.Say the anime takes the life of someone or someones mother/father/sister/brother if that is something sad to you then you would cry if it isn't then you don't or if something happens that you would find funny you'll laugh.This anime WILL make you cry even if your not a crier you will cry trust me.Now if you watch the anime and it doesn't make you cry then write your own review because i want to know how others feel about this anime.

    1. Trying my best not to spoil anything 
2. This is my first time writing a review so I have no idea how well this will go but ""ahuehuehue"" it anyways. 
Story (9): 
Not really what you expected to happen. At least, if you want to watch it to see how would the anime look like. Honestly, tho I had read the play and I was with the idea ""Oh well, I'm going to be bored"" in my head, I went ahead and watched it. If you think about the show as an interpretation within an interpretation you'd get it somehow why it happened the way it happened. I'll give you a hint: trees. But because it was made this way there are chances that you wouldn't agree/like it, so it's a bit ""dangerous"". 
Art (9): 
Nothing much to say, I pretty liked it. It was bright and the details were well done. Irises flowers and petals were astonishing. There were a bit of weird noses around, but let's not make the end of the world from it.  
Sound (8): 
What I can say about the OP? One word - amazing. But sound isn't only about the OP. I really felt sometimes like it was really ""silent""- just the voice acting. And talking about the voice acting, I felt like the Japanese version was better made. Not quite sure if just my preference to the language, tho English is my second one, or the acting was stronger. Watch an episode dubbed and one subbed and choose. Imo, it really matters in your enjoyment how you find the voice acting.  
Characters (7): 
Some characters do a lot and you don't get much about them, some do a little and you could say more about those. There's no balance. I really expected Juliet and Romeo, at least those to develop more. 
Enjoyment (9): 
Yup. As for me I pretty had much fun watching. After a batch of episodes I was always ""going"" to sleep. But, I was finding myself thinking what will happen next, why something happened and ""OMG JULIET YOU DID IT AGAIN GJ GIRL"" or ""OMG...."" oh wait sorry spoilers. Spoilers sweeties. Seriously, I really had fun. 
Overall: 8

    Titel: Romeo x Juliet 
Sorry! It is only German :O 
Genres: Romance, Drama, Action, Fantasy, Abenteuer  
Handlung: Basiert auf dem Werk von William Shakespeare. Allerdings nur der grobe Konflikt. Das Setting ist stark abgeändert, im Fantasy Stil eben. Handelt von dem jungen Mädchen Juliet, die mit ansehen musste, wie ihre gesamte Familie ermordet wurde. Sie War allerdings erst 2 Jahre alt und kann sich deshalb nicht mehr daran erinnern. Bis zu ihrem 16ten Geburtstag... 
Charaktere: 
Sind nicht unbedingt die besten, da von einigen kaum die Hintergründe vorgestellt werden. Doch bei den meisten wird doch ein wenig beleuchtet. Auch den ""Bösen"" kann man gegen Ende teilweise verstehen und sich in ihn hineinversetzen. Allerdings sind bei ein paar der 'Hauptpersonen' leider Wie schon erwähnt die Hintergründe nicht gut bis garniert ausgearbeitet. 
Musik: Sehr schön und passend. Ist mir nur an einer Stelle ein wenig negativ aufgefallen, kann aber sonst nur sagen, dass sie die Bilder und Handlungen nahezu perfekt unterstreicht.  
Animation und Zeichenstil: 
Die Animationen sind sehr solide bis wunderschön. Die wehenden Flaggen in der Stadt sind einfach toll animiert und detailliert gezeichnet. Wobei der Zeichenstil der Personen nicht unbedingt jedermanns Geschmack ist. Ich musste mich erstmal ein wenig daran gewöhnen, aber finde ihn doch durchaus schön. 
Persönliches Fazit: Ich habe den Anime als Anime ""zwischendurch"" begonnen, dachte mir: Joa. Kann man ja mal versuchen.... Da ich noch nie wirklich einen Romance Anime gesehen habe. Ich habe ihn über Nacht durchgesuchtet, da die Handlung extrem Fesselnd wird, nach den ersten paar Folgen. Man fasst so viel Zuneigung zu den einzelnen Charakteren, wenn man sich auch nur ein wenig Gedanken über das, was geschieht macht. Ich persönlich habe auch die ein oder andere Träne vergießen können. Aus Freude, Hoffnung oder Leid. Dazu ist der Anime durchaus in der Lage.

    ""Innovative and visually stunning, the anime series Romeo x Juliet is a new or should I say, modern interpretation of Shakespeare's timeless classic which sets the doomed love of the Montague and Capulet heirs, Romeo and Juliet, against a rich fantasy world with dramatically charged political background.""  
Actually, Romeo x Juliet is indeed an epic anime. yeah., epic. very ... epic. -.- 
Well., I was totally dumbstruck with the graphics, visual arts, opening song, with Romeo Mon-- err, sorry! I was going to say 'characters'., and yeah, the anime is very dazzling! *Yippee!! study GONZO, you did a great job again!!! So proud of you guys!! >mode: teary-eyedJuliet Fia ... ma-atta?? Fiammatta!! Juliet Fiammatta Ars De Capulet!! **wooh!! thanks Google, I owe you my life!**  what a name. she shouldn't go to a typical school while she bears that name!! oh anyways., Juliet is a great heroine. She's beautiful, bold, graceful and has a very compassionate heart. If I were a guy, she's going to be my ideal girl!! swear!!  
>Romeo Candore De Montague-- *while I was typing his name I can't help but smile- like a maniac!*   Romeo Montague is ... hot. hot. hot. a very hot prince!! gosh!! can I be your princess instead?! :PP **the song 'Love Story' is currently playing on the background** 
seriously., I adore his gentle personality. I admire his bravery and compassion towards his people in Neo Verona and of course, I love the way he loved Juliet. ~~He was very cute and charming when he first saw Juliet *feminine side* at the Montague's house during a ball.  
Well., almost all the characters here are pleasing to the viewers' eyes., *oh yeah, one of the most interesting characters in Romeo x Juliet is William, a comedic char. in many respects. He's obviously a reference to the original author of Romeo and Juliet--the world's pre-eminent dramatist, William Shakespeare.  
Since it's a story of Romeo x Juliet., I hope you didn't forget that their story is very unlikely to be a ""happily ever after"" thingy., yes, it's not the same as what happened to Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.  
Romeo + Juliet = tragedy.  
tuuuuuuuttttt-------spoiler alert!! 
I did cry during the last episode!! oh Romeo., why!!! why did you have to die!! then after a while I was like ... OMG Juliet!!! don't sacrifice yourself!! there's still another way!!  
Though it was sad., you'd still feel grateful to the both of them., most especially to Juliet., she sacrificed herself for the sake of Neo Verona. **and what the heck!! Neo Verona actually floats!!**

    In my evaluation 7 is an anime that I definitely enjoy but wont repeat, so let me give you my opinion. 
First, don't expect that the history will be the same as you remember, is a well done adaptation of the original with a touch of fantasy. The first chapters will catch your attention, the middle could be repetitive and a little boring, but the final chapters save in a incredible way the hole history. 
If you're looking for a romance history, I can recommend this one. 
Story: Like I said before the final chapters will make you happy to seen this anime. I like that the sequence of the story will reveal hints that induce to guess the ending. Maybe in the middle you may think ¿this chapters are really necessary? I would said not for the main history, but for characters. Is really original in the develop since I know the original one, and I'm sure you will satisfy with the end. 
Art: At the begging I have some doubts if it really gone fit with the characters but as the story progresses it will. The landscapes are really nice, and the main characters outfit suit really well. Some of the character designs appealing don't really convince me until the end, but others fit in the instant you see them. The art is not may I say ""strong"", I mean there not will details in everything but the important thing, It offer a soft atmosphere that follow the love history. 
Sound: The seiyus personifying very well the characters, and in a love history of course for love scenes will be romantic music. The background music and sounds fit very well, and you should take into account the time that the anime was released for evaluate the quality. The opening is really beautiful and sadly romantic, but since some times the history need to be known as soon as possible, the opening relax the climax. The ending songs suits, second more than the first. 
Characters: At the begging I was not totally convinced with the main, since they keep acting in the same way, specially Julieta, excepting a strong and decided woman, not always is like that, but for this is that the other characters exist, to complement her. I really like Tebaldo, is the kind of character that make the history more interesting because is full of mysteries, and sure he is. But in general the develop of each character is well done, it could be more but its just the necessary to understand the history. 
Enjoyment: Like I said I enjoy watching it but I won't repeat it. Its a great anime that I can recommend If you have free time and want a romance history that will surprise you. Im sure you will enjoy if you see it until the end.

    I have seen this on my recommended list quite a lot of times but have always been hesitant to watch it. I have never liked Romeo and Juliet the Shakespear play and was expecting this anime to be just as bad. I was wrong........ 
While the basic storyline is the same, the whole star crossed lovers and all, the details are completely different, and to top it all off, its a fantasy too. There are flying horses and all sorts of magical stuff that improves rather than detacts from the story. 
While it may completely destroy shakspears play, it is far more enjoyable and i want to strangle the main two characters far less. Definitely worth a watch! 9.5/10

    Warning, Review may contain spoilers! 
I really liked this anime. Please realize, however, for those of you who have yet to watch it, the title, I believe, is purely for commercial reasons. Using the title of something so familiar was what first drew me to it, and I am certain that was their intention. Quite clever, really. Apart from the 'star crossed lovers' plot, there is no similarity to the play. When they say it's loosely based on the play, they mean a completely different thread. 
They borrow names from other of Shakespeare's plays, such as Ophelia, and Patrucio (if that's spelled right) But I found no similarities to the characters of the 'original' plays. 
When Romeo leaves the mines with the other workers, it truly shows his competence as a ruler. In the scene where his father dies, there is a very clear contrast in which you see both Romeo's and Montegue's capes; Romeo no longer wears the family crest, meaning he truly gave up his name. In that same scene it is obvious they used the ending of Hamlet; the poisoned sword and all that. 
On a historical note, the besieging of the castle in episode 22 (I think) was reminiscent of the Glorious Revolution, of course in the revolution, the king simply flees to France, but still everyone else surrendered and even welcomed the rebels. 
The end was befitting, and I loved it, but I kept hoping they were still alive 'till the very last minute of the last episode. Perhaps it had been wishful thinking, but I kept seeing hints that they would live--like when they acting out the play in Mantua and Juliet doesn't say the lines assigned to her. Also, how Romeo seemed be almost maturing as a leader. I hated it, really, because it kept you so optimistic and then, they're dead. 
Unfortunately, I don't think there was much character development. It feels as if they remain static. None of them really change through out the series. I think they could have expanded a bit more on some of the supported characters, since we still don't know what was Cordelia's original connection to Juliet. Was she a maid or daughter of a loyal noble? Antonio as well. I didn't even know he was the old man's grandson until the very end. And how about the other two? How did they get involved? The ending left a lot of unanswered questions. 
I did like watching it, but in all honesty, I was a bit disappointed with the romance. I didn't quite feel the conflict. Really, what's to keep him from joining rebel forces? I don't know if this is simply me being silly, but when I watch a romance I expect to feel giddy or depressed depending on the even, and I was only touched (not enough for tears though, which I would have hoped for) when they died at the end. Again, I think this is the fault of not enough character development.

    I have to be honest, I GREATLY  hesitated on even watching this anime version of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.... But i am very glad that i did. I was blown away. 
Going into this anime i expected it to be predictable, cheesy, generic etc. But no, it was fantastic. 
The story was not at all like the classic romeo and juliet, there are more twists and surprises than even the original. I was never bored and it kept me wanting more. Character development was realistic and not generic as well. 
I dont think i have ever teared up as much to any other anime like i did to this one. And this wasn't at the ending, it was throughout the season. I believe that is all i can say without spoiling any of the story for people who haven't seen this.

    This anime is an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s novel of the same name without the X for those who do not know. The most obvious difference it is more in-lined with fantasy, semi-action and of course the romance/drama genre. 
Its story simple if you read or know the novel, it is basically like this: two families, war, unrest, lovers, romance and death those are its main concepts. The flow of the story is more like the simple introduction, conflict, climax, conclusion and ending. The built up or the pacing is quiet slow and more on story based than action. However it has its different approach on concept it’s more modern or somewhat does not follow the stereotypical damsel in distress and other clichés the characters are okay and easily understandable. The plot is good with mix of fantasy and a few turn of events that are obvious on what’s going to happen but nevertheless quite fascinating. The romance on this anime is plain a bit cheesy but still quiet romantic depending on the viewers. Next is the action element, the fight and death scenes are bit mild it just adds a dramatic effect on the stories events for example duel of handsome guys or a display of martyrdom. As for the music the opening song and the BGM is good but I like the ending song it has a somewhat rock. Although the BGM is good it still lacks a certain vibe. The characters voice actors are good. The art style and . How the characters are portrayed are more on the typical but not totally cliché but still retain their distinct features and personality that are unique in a way. The anime is more story oriented or it focuses on the drama and romance rather than action. I may recommend

    So yeah. We all know the tragic story of Romeo and Juliet; The son and daughter of rivalling families who fall in love with one another. We all know the cheesy crap the said to each other. Pain, hatred, sadness and a love that could not be. Nothing new about that. So with that said, it may seem impossible to make an interesting anime out of it. Without boring people with corny, overused vows and predictable plotlines. However, Romeo x Juliet proved the opposite to me. 
The first thing I liked about this story already was the fact that the 'Mysterious Hero' in this story, is the girl. It's the girl who saves innocent townpeople in distress. It's the girl that risks her own life in order to save other's. All that, while in the beginning, the boy is more of a wuss. A very kind wuss though. =] Apart from that, the story didn't seem to be all that promising from the start. The first few episodes were a little bit predictable. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, fall in love, and then find out it's an impossible love and all that stuff, but it got way more interesting after a few episodes. The story gradually unfolds in a way that's easy to follow, yet not slow. Turns out there's a lot more to it than Shakespeare's original play. 
Okay, initially, I had a little problem with the art style. But as soon as I got used to it, I also came to love it. It's way more realistic than all of those huge-eye-animes, and that suits the story as well. (I'm not saying the story's realistic though, it's fantasy after all. ^^ But the feelings of most of the characters were illustrated very realistic. 
Sometimes I get a little tired of anime where every character looks identical except fot their hairstyle and -colour and their eyecolour. It's really refreshing to see something like Romeo x Juliet once in a while, where you could immediately recognize each character just by looking at them, even it they were wearing a wig and colour contacts.  
Based on character design, there are three sorts of anime: Anime where every single person is pretty. Most of the time I find anime like that pretty annoying, but in cases like Clannad, Ef, or Nana, I can get over it. Second, there are anime where all the goodies are beautiful and the baddies are ugly. (Even more annoying, if you ask me). And last, there are anime where characters looking ugly can still be good guys, including handsome bastards. Romeo x Juliet belongs to the last sort, and also the most realistic sort. Even better is the fact that basically there are no real goodies or baddies. Most of the bad guys just do what they're told because they're scared, and even the biggest badass is not completely evil. It's no good or evil. Just people like you and me who do good and bad stuff. That's the way I like it. 
This is the very best anime I saw ever since Clannad, and I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good love story. It got me in a really romantic mood, and sometimes; I just wanted to hug my laptop. It didn't brought me to tears, but I think this should be able to make somebody cry. For the anime-boy-fangirls among us, there's plenty of drooling materials with Francisco, Tybalt and Romeo himself. However, if you want bouncing breasts and 'accidental' panty-shots, you shouldn't bother wasting your time watching this until you grow up.

    It was absolutely PERFECT. Outstanding. I have never seen any other anime like this one, it's doesn't have a typical story and the plot is well-written. Although I have read only up to Act 2 of the original Romeo and Juliet script in the past therefore not qualifying to be able to differentiate and criticize between the original and this version, I find this anime entirely amazing and utterly stunning out of all other animes I have watched. There are many changes though, because it is only loosely based on Shakespeare's work. Also, I was completely hooked that it was almost as though it wasn't just an anime anymore. xD 
It's just out of the ordinary. 
To be honest though, the only points I didn't like about it was that there was rarely any humor, and instead, it was all seeerious like Peach Girl. But that makes it appropriate and well-suited to the whole plot, story and background anyway. If it was comical whatsoever in any way it would've been a joke altogether. 
Also, sometimes there are scenes of violence that I can't stand. At least they don't display the actual sight of the bloodshed, but the way they present the scene in those moments just send shivers down my spine. ._. 
Whatever, overall, it left me with a huge overall impression. 
I definitely recommend this anime to, well, entirely everyone.

     What can i say? I liked the original Romeo and Juliet.When i first read the title, I'm like a anime version of the Romeo and Juliet? I thought to myself why would i watch it if i had already seen the life action. So i decided to give it a try and I must say it WASN'T like the original story at all. 
Story: The story was interesting and like i said, it wasn't like the original story at all. The first half of the series was addicting and keep me happy and it was sweet. However, I felt that the second half of the series drag on and there were a lot of unnecessary content.The feeling you feel from the first half is not going to be the same in the second half of the series. I also felt like it could have finished like 5 or 6 episodes early. 
Art: Eh, i would say that it has that 90s-2000s feelings. The character has everything right. Body size,eyes,boobs,etc 
Sound: I was impress with the sound. It sounded like i imagine it would. It has that medieval music? 
Character: For an anime with a lot of key players. I have to say that they were developed nicely. 
Overall: I would say go for this anime, Even if your not a fan of Shakespeare. The story was different, the sound(or music?) was amazing and it fitted in. I would have to say that it does get a bit drag on. But still, even with the second half of the series flaws, it was still an amazing series to watch.

    YES!! It's an anime, but I think it would be rather cool too see. Supposly the Montagues and Caplets live on floating islands in the clouds and there is some war betten the two of them. It's got fantasy with the white winged horses and if you notice on the trailer that right after Romeo flys down on his horse he meet Juliet's gaze, and they both share a moment and then right then they KISS!! Gosh, so quick. (LAUGHS) but it's sooooooooooooooooooooo cute KAWAII!!!! The story isnt like the orignal Romeo and Juliet but that is GONZO and they do a great job making it their own.

    ''Two households both alike in dignity, in fair''....Neo Verona?!? 
Romeo X Juliet loosely tells Shakespeare's fateful tale, with heaps of action, romance, politics and fantasy. 
The story-line is certainly a strong point in this anime, with touching romance and unexpected tragedy. The story is well paced, and quickly grows in momentum. At times, there are some predictable moments and the story simmers down, but there is always something to get it on its feet again. With such an engaging story I expected the conclusion to be a let down, but it ends both beautifully and dramatically.  
The art is not particularly amazing, but in my personal opinion it is still very good. The characters are not drawn so exaggerated as in many animes, and neither does everyone look the same-which is a welcome change. 
The sound soundtrack played throughout works as a warming addition to the tale-especially in the final episodes, the music plays a rather important part in creating a majestic end.  
Our hero and heroine are both interesting and complex which is a relief! Juliet is not a weak and vulnerable protagonist, but is strong and determined. I love the fact, many characters are not portrayed merely as 'good' or 'evil', everyone has their own past which shapes who they are. There are many characters in this story, due to the sub plots within the anime, and though some are cliche, for the most part they are original and realistic.  
Having just watched the new Hollywood Romeo and Juliet, and now this anime, I must say this tale was a far more captivating one. Though I love the original, this anime gives an interesting and alternative view, but delivering the same spectacular result.

    Ah, doesn’t everyone just love an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet by the ever famous play writer William Shakespeare? I can’t really say I do, because if there’s one genre I can’t stand, it’s romance. Well, kind of. I’ll never pass up an opportunity to do a little character shipping or see some really sweet scenes, but soppy romance just makes me want to throw up. Romeo and Juliet is FULL to the brim of soppy romance, so I guess I am inclined to give this anime a lower score.  
Let’s start off with the story. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, and heavily implied through the title, this is an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Needless to say, it has the same basic plot line. For that plot line, I would give a 5. However, I’m able to move that score up one notch because of the differences presented between this one and the original. I really did like the new setting of Neo Verona, in a sort of future environment, that the Capulets have been almost obliterated. In short, I found the numerous tweaks on the story intriguing and ultimately better than the original (gotta say, I’m not a huge fan of Shakespeare, possibly because of the amount of plays bearing his signature I’ve had to study and will have to study in the future). I add one more point to the score because of the plot twists. No, setting it in a different environment and shaking up the story weren’t enough - we also discover that the natures of characters are not as it may have seemed - they are actually quite complicated.  
However, this is another failed ending. While it does include some of the tragedy of the original play, it doesn’t make that much sense. It’s nowhere as confusing as the ending of Kyoukai no Kanata, but it’s still puzzling and kind of disappointing. I would use this to bring the story down by 0.5, but since I’m feeling nice today, I won’t.  
Next comes art. It’s quite obvious that this was a low budget anime. The art style isn’t too dreadful, in fact scenery and particularly buildings come out quite nicely, but the characters… Well, they’re not that dreadful. For once, they look much too old, and they do not bear the traditional anime-style traits. I will admit that some characters are cute and/or mildly good-looking (I think ‘mildly hot’ would be a little bit of a contradiction - don’t you?), but the rest, well, I can only say one word - Meh. A big fat ‘meh’. Juliet looks nice, I would say, only in the opening when she has hair up and is shouting. But, I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. No more than a 6 in my opinion. 
Music was okay, I really don’t have much to say about this subject. I liked the first ending theme. Perhaps it’s because I have so little to say about this that I give it a 5.5.  
Next comes character. This is perhaps the first time I am criticising character because of a different factor other than development. The character development here was decent, it was okay. No it’s not that which caused me to give this a 5. In fact, I could almost say that it’s because of the character development that I give this a 5. Now I’m starting to sound like someone who is never happy, which is not the case, so let me explain. 
I’m aiming mainly at Juliet here. Her character is sometimes so grown up and other times so childish I firmly believe that her age changes constantly between 5 and 30. I watched this anime with my dad, and most of our time was spent yelling at Juliet and laughing at her ridiculous decisions. She may be good in battle, but in strategy, even I, the person who never plans, am better at her in seeing future scenarios. She makes such stupid decisions at times, what are supposed to be dramatic scenes turn plainly comical.   
She is also so lovestruck with Romeo, it’s past hilarious. While he is also in love with her, his case is nowhere near as bad.  
I also think that too many characters have little or no relevance to the plot. For instance, Regan, or Hermione. And I LIKE Regan, so I’m not being biased her. I also think that Antonio could claim child abuse. I mean, making that tiny, little, cutie-pumpkin fight? It’s criminal. 
Romeo is also one of those perpetually lucky protagonists, which is another cliche element that I cannot tolerate.  
Sometimes I think that the most decent character in the anime is Cielo - the dragonsteed (a horse with wings). *scoffs*  
Really, some characters made this anime comical, which I don’t think was intended.  
To conclude, while this was an interesting adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, it did have some confusing elements, okay art, and sometimes ridiculous characters.  
Story: 7/10 (would give 6.5) 
Art: 6/10 
Music: 5.5/10 
Characters: 5/10 (I’m being nice here) 
Enjoyment: 6 
Overall: 5.9/10 (rounded to a 6) 
A/N: Thank you to all those who have commented on my reviews! I hope to make them consistently better, and only you can help me do that. Thank you in advance.

    Well, to start... I was in the mood to watch romance, once in a while, so I just picked randomly.  
I already seen Gankutsuou... I didn't expect this to be a close version of the piece anyway, but this.is.genius. It's just as non-european as it possible for a european setting. That was the only thing entertaining me all 24 eps. Starting from gestures and etiquette and ending with philosophy.  
The plot... Well, what's with it again? Yep, they took a piece and put it into a shredder. One family killed the other. But the heiress survived. Now, begone, old tyrant. I was more enjoying analyzing the probable outcome of Lord Montague social politics if it was happening in real life than actually following the second part of story... Something with tree of life. Yeah. Those who died, died. Those who didn't bothered, lived happily ever after in a candyland. Why taking story on a floating island, no idea. Nothing could possibly change if it was happening on the Earth surface. But then again, it's anime. Everything is fancier with winged horses. Makes me wonder, why no one bothered to bring on a katana, because everything is even more exciting with it. Oh, and battle scenes are epic. In a kind when character can make a long-term speech while other swing a sword. And the first one still get to dodge after finishing.  
Not like I'm a Shakespeare fan. I've only read the original story once, back when I was a teen. But while watching, I really wanted to open the book and search through to finally understand where the hell they took that weird cast from. The author avatar *Willy* was the most annoying thing ever... To the point of not being funny annoying. Srsly, get some respect to the writer maybe? 
I'm not the one to judge the soundtrack, but well... It was at least bearable. No earworms. No dissonance. Rarely noticeable, actually. I'm fine with it tho. 
So, in the end: 
""+""  Pretty funny story that doesn't affect brain. Everything you would expect from a typical shojo anime (SIC!) in fantasy-Middle-age entourage. No unpredictable turns... But then again, no desire to try and predict something. What politics? What war? What plot? Hey, they look so sweet together. 
""-"" If cliché put you in a bad mood, you'd better not to come close... If you're thinking when you're watching, avoid this of all costs. And hey, their logic makes you facepalm so hard. I nearly broke my nerdy glasses doing so.

Critic's Log - Earthdate: February 14, 2013. Review #34: Romeo x Juliet 
Two households, both alike in dignity, 
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, 
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, 
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. 
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes 
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; 
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows 
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife. 
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, 
And the continuance of their parents' rage, 
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, 
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; 
The which if you with patient ears attend, 
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. 
Ah, William Shakespeare, he sure has his way with words. Both poetic and HARD TO UNDERSTAND AT TIMES! Thank God for footnotes in later editions of his plays! Well, today is Valentine’s Day and I thought I’d do a special review today for this occasion. Since it’s Valentine’s Day, I decided to review Romeo x Juliet, obviously an anime adaptation of Romeo and Juliet from William Shakespeare. I have seen this anime twice and I’ve read the play. This is Shakespeare’s famous tragic love story and I think it is somewhat fitting that I’d review this on this day. With that said, let’s celebrate Valentine’s Day with Romeo x Juliet! 
This is a story of a young and tragic love, set in the aerial city of Neo Verona in the skies above. Tyranny rules this island in the sky after the Montague family took control 14 years prior when all seemed dire. The disparity among the wealthy and poor is apparent in the present state, the earth dries and water stagnates. The sky itself is wrapped in a deep dense fog. Both Romeo and Juliet's lineages are of present and past ruling families of Neo Verona. Romeo is the son of the current Montague dictator, Juliet (a beautiful woman) masquerades as a man she's the last descendent of Capulet the previous rulers who were killed by an assasin's dagger 14 years ago. Her true background is not to be revealed to her until her 16th birthday. The cruel hands of fate introduces 2 people who will become ""Star Crossed Lovers"". 
To be technical, this is a Studio Gonzo production and I was skeptical at first when I saw this series and thank God that this series doesn't suffer from the usual crap that Gonzo is known for with it poor iteration of 2D and 3D animation. The animation is excusable this time for Gonzo regarding Romeo x Juliet 
The music is something worth mentioning and something not to be ignored. It is composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto who was well known for the soundtracks of Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy XII. The music by Sakimoto-san is just great. It compliments nearly every scene giving some scenes emotional impact. I have played Final Fantasy XII and I really enjoyed the grand scale to that soundtrack while playing that game even though combat was a real slow pain in the ass to deal with. Now that Romeo x Juliet's soundtrack is done by this composer, it doesn't call too much attention but I can say the score is phenomenal. It is near-perfect and the only thing that bumps the music's chords is the first closing theme 
This is a play written hundreds of years ago and I honestly think this closing theme was unfitting to the entire show. I mean, Rock music in a Romeo and Juliet adaptation? Why? Why was this in there? The song is great outside the show, but in the show... I don't think it fits at all. The second closing theme on the other hand is okay for the most part. Then there's the opening ""Inori - You Raise Me Up"" which was sung by Korean-American singer Lena Park. For any music buffs out there. ""You Raise Me Up"" was originally done by the duo Secret Garden with Brendan Graham as the lyricist and Rolf Løvland as the composer. You might be familiar with the song by Josh Groban which he did cover the song a year after it was originally written. It is sung as a contemporary hymn in church services. I sure like to hear that when I'm attending church. Now that I've digressed about the opening for a bit, allow me to tell you what I thought of the opening. Lena Park was terrific for her cover on this song. It is sung in Japanese in the opening. It is also sung in English for Episode 7 and the Final Episode. I don't know what else to say about her cover, it's just very good. 
When it comes to voice acting, Get ready to boo and yell at me for saying this but please hear my plea even in discontent. This show is extremely fitting in the dub. Hear me out O purists or question me from thee jurists! This play was originally written in Modern English by William Shakespeare himself, so it would only be fitting to at least watch the dub for that. There's nothing wrong with the Japanese cast in the show. Takahiro Mizushima is fine as Romeo, Fumie Mizusawa is also fine as Juliet. If there's any standout performances in this version, that would be Koji Ishii as Montague and Kazuhiko Inoue as William (Yes, William Shakespeare is a character in this show. yeah...just go with it) This version also has Ryotaro Okiayu, Keiji Fujiwara, and Toru Ohkawa. With the dub, there's Chris Burnett as Romeo in which he sounds a bit dull but it's not his fault because he actually plays a good Romeo, Brina Palencia plays a terrific Juliet, As far as some standout performances in the dub, there's Colleen Clinkenbeard as Cordelia, J.Michael Tatum plays a terrific William, Maxey Whitehead is great as Antonio. Mike McFarland is also great as Tybalt. Sean Hannigan is the highlight of the dub as Montague. What makes the dub great in this anime is that they have some Shakespearean-like dialogue but the only problem in the dub is that it's not constant, you'll have to pay attention with your ears on that part though. The Japanese script does use some Shakespearean dialogue albiet in Japanese. Both versions are good but I strongly prefer the dub here. 
When it comes to characters, some of the characters act a bit different than the original play. There are some characters in this anime that are not even from the original play which I don't understand why they are included in this adaptation, but oh well. There's Ophelia, Camilo, and Petruchio which the names are most likely nods to Shakespeare's plays such as Hamlet, The Winter's Tale, and The Taming of the Shrew. The only character that's not a nod to any of Shakespeare's plays that is exclusive to this adaptation is Giovanni (and hey, that just so happens to be my first name I kid you not) Some of these characters exclusive to this adaptation are alright but I don't know what else to say about them really. The characters are great even though the characters based off the play do act a bit differently than the original play. 
If the name ""Neo-Verona"", flying steeds, or the fact that William Shakespeare is a character in this adaptation wasn't enough proof that this isn't really a faithful adaptation to Shakespeare's tragic love story, then allow me to do some explaining. This is a more modernized, alternate telling with some fantasy settings. 
This loose adaptation may not sit well for fans of the original play and if you think this is the only adaptation that is much different than the original play, Allow me to mention another adaptation called Romeo + Juliet, a 1996 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet. The Montagues and Capulets are portrayed as warring business empires and instead of swords, there are guns in that adaptation. 
Some may not like that movie and I don't hear many people bitch about this movie and I have that same impression towards this loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragic love story. If there is something worth mentioning about this adaptation that some people do tend to overlook is that there are a lot of double entendres in the original play. If I were writing this play like Shakespeare would, such an example would be ""I standeth with my sword raised high and I shall use mine sword to cut the maiden's head and I shall beareth that burden till the moment to die."" these double entendres in the play were sexual and that example I just pointed out is in a manner as such. Call me a pervert if you wish, but hey... Shakespeare was kind of a pervert too and he got away with it too. Speaking of double entendres, there is no such a thing in this adaptation, making it the most sexually pure adaptation of Romeo and Juliet so far. Unfortunately, this adaptation isn't perfect though because even though the play is brilliant, there is one thing I can point out that they could have stuck to, and that is the ending. This adaptation does not have the tragic ending that the play was unanimously well-known for. This adaptation has more of a happy ending which I can't guarantee fans of the original play will like. I almost didn't like the ending, but I later found myself liking this adaptation's ending. What this adaptation stays true is that it contains the spirit of the original play it was based on even though it does not have the tragic ending. Reiko Yoshida took many liberties with Shakespeare's original play and makes it differ extensively and Fumitoshi Oizaki's direction isn't perfect but it isn't sloppy. Also, J. Michael Tatum deserves some credit for the ADR direction as well as R. Bruce Elliot for the dub. Kinda fitting that J.Michael Tatum was the ADR director for 2/3 of the show since he was the English voice of Shakespeare. With all the words I've writ, I bid this review adieu. 
Romeo x Juliet is available from Funimation. The manga written my Reiko Yoshida is available by Yen Press. Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare is available freaking anywhere and I'm certain you possibly read it at high school or college unless you somehow didn't get to read it in class. There are a number of film adaptations of the play which I don't care to list them all down because this would just make the epilogue much longer and there's not much ado about nothing that I even want to discuss all the movies. Look them up at your own leisure. 
With all that said, Romeo x Juliet is a surprise adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragic love story which is a masterpiece by all means. I love this play. While this anime takes many liberties with Shakespeare's play, it has beautiful imagery for the most part with Gonzo's humble approach, it has a wonderful soundtrack, it has great characters even if they act different than they did in the original play, and the story is great (for an alternate telling that is). You might be skeptical at first, if you give this a try... you might be surprised on how good this loose adaptation can be. 
I give Romeo x Juliet a 9.1 out of 10. It is EXCELLENT! 
Feel free to comment below, and celebrate this day with LOVE AND PEACE!

    If you were looking for a faithful anime adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, sorry to disappoint this isn't it. Please go watch the 343 film bc that's the closest you will get to one.  
Now I'm not the biggest fan of Romeo and Juliet, mainly because the play is full of too many contrivances and miscommunications and weak characters all mixed in with the most flowery of rhetoric. Now my boy Willy Shakes was never really known for his ability as a story teller but HE IS A MASTER OF LANGUAGE! Shakespeare can take the shittiest story and make it classic because he knew how to use language in such a way that makes it so.  
So, to see an anime adaptation of R+J not only completely turn the story on its head, but actually making our two leads interesting and likeable characters, while also having lines pulled directly from the play and other references to Shakespeare's works? And my boy Lil Will from Stratford upon Avon born and raised is an actual character?! Color me impressed.  
Like I said this is not a faithful adaptation, there are a lot of changes from the original play. The capulets and the montegues are not wealthy merchants with a rivalry that no one can fucking explain. Instead the entirety of the capulet family isn't even in the anime; having been the slaughtered ruling family of Neo Verona, ending their rule by the wicked villain montegue, where he ascends to the throne as Neo Verona's ruling tyrant; holding power with an iron fist. Juliet is the sole survivor of the house of Capulet and must hide her identity and disguise herself as a boy until her 16th birthday were all would be revealed. Romeo, being the son of the now dictator prince, is a young man with a gentle soul always looking out for and willingly helping others. He looks upon the oppression of Neo Verona sorrowfully and vows to make things right when he assumes the throne. Juliet must take it upon herself to reclaim her birth rite and free the people of Neo Verona. They fall in love and work together to build a world where they could live in peace without their families names. There are a lot of references to Shakespeare's other plays including character names like Petruchio, Antonio, Cordelia, Ophelia, etc. 
Animation wise, it was pretty solid although there was some jarring CG used in some of the landscape and scenery backgrounds that kind of looked bizarre. There was also the branches of the esscalis tree that were animated with CG and they look like PlayStation 2 graphics, they were pretty bad. The character designs were really nice, and special shout out to my boy tybalt HE IS SOOO FREAKING HOT LIKE DAMN JULIET WHAT YOU DOING WITH ROMEO'S BITCH ASS WHEN YOU GOT THAT BEEFCAKE TYBALT HANGING AROUND YA GIRL!! Yea I sort of developed a crush on him bc he is hot and mysterious and has black hair and momma like her the cool mysterious types.  
The music was absolutely finominal, but I should warn you if you don't like ""You Raise Me Up"" by Josh Grobin you will not be able to stand the score; they play that song like 65% of the time in English, Japanese and instrumental. Also you need to watch this in the English dub bc duh it's Shakespeare!  
Overall, I give this anime a solid 8. It does loose a couple points for it does slow down a bit halfway through and we get like 3-4 episodes where Romeo is at this mine and tries to start a village with the prisoners who worked in the mine and yea didn't really much care for it. It also lost a point because of the ending. So if you don't want to be spoiled ( but you know how it ends because everyone knows how Romeo and Juliet ends) STOP READING NOW! Go watch the anime!!  
Ok, WTF was up with that ending. If one thing did not work in this anime is the whole plot with the esscalis tree bc When you think about it, it's fucking stupid. According to Ophelia, there were two trees instead one but one died so Juliet has to die in order to give life back to the tree that's left because it is also dying and the world will crumble and fall if it dies. Romeo dies trying to save Juliet from this fate and kills Ophelia ultimately destroying the esscalis tree. BUT THEN THE BITCH SACRIFICIES HERSELF TO THE FUCKING TREE ANYWAY. Wtf was the point of Romeo dying to protect you of yo ass was going to die to give life to the tree anyway. WHY? And also, NEO VERONA WAS A FUCKING FLOATING ISLAND! The entire reason to save the esscalis tree was because it was the source that kept Neo Verona a float. In the end the city falls anyway and get this, it was a mother flipping island the whole time. Like I don't understand did these people not know? William said they didn't, so what did they think that Neo Verona was the entire world? We're there minds not blown when they touched upon the ocean and saw there was more to their world like wtf? Why was it played off so lightly their world turned out to be a whole bigger than they could ever imagine! The more I think about it, the stupider it gets so I'm just going to chalk it up to being fucking anime. Only in anime man. Thanks for reading the review!

    to preclude the review, it is very important to note that while the anime says that it is based off shakespeare's play, it is only very loosely based on the actual plot while maintaining the fundamental aspects that make it a classic. that being said, i'm sure that viewers will have already developed a preset opinion on what will happen and that might disillusion them to the unique twist that this anime provides for the story of romeo and juliet. 
story: the romance between romeo and juliet proceeds very quickly, and the anime does well to portray the idea that beyond the chaos and deception that plagues their lives, they give their sanity away in pursuit of unrequited love -- bound for eternity. it is a very touching story given juliet's conflict between upholding her birthright and rejecting the one she desires most. romeo and juliet's will to compromise in order to be together no matter what circumstances is the idea weaved throughout the entire story. however, the ending is extremely bizarre and abruptly introduced. while it was hinted at several time, the sci-fi nature and awkward clash with the setting is very off-putting. also a few episodes are wasted on introducing characters whom are hardly important to the overall plot. 9/10 
art: the art matches exactly what one might presume of ""Neo Verona."" it is very lavish yet the beauty lies with the simplicity. the art is clean and polished and definitely fits with the elizabethan feel the anime was going for. 10/10 
sound: much like the art, the sound only further adds to the wonders of the anime. the orchestral music crescendos in suspenseful situations and decrescendos in moments of sadness; overall, the music dynamics are used sparingly but definitely when necessary. the soundtrack adds to the romantic feeling, and the opening song as the japanese version of ""you raise me up"" is fitting for the support that the characters provide for each other. 10/10 
character: 
despite juliet being the sole heir to the capulet name, she does not exhibit the stereotypical qualities of snobbishness and ungratefulness that one might assume of a noble. in fact, her humble upbringing is probably why she is filled with justice and valiance. when she meets romeo, at first, their relationship spirals into her constantly becoming dejected but at the end their bond only strengthens their willpower. romeo also at first seems to be passive with the situation with his father but the character development later on shows him to be a brave fighter. the ""villains"" of the anime aren't characterized as outlandishly evil; they all have an inner depth to them that justifies why they act the way they do. the only problem is that some characters are highly overlooked and neglected because of how much standing juliet and other characters have as the high-ranking leaders. there are also characters whom are introduced that do not serve any purpose at all but to fill the plot. 9/10 
enjoyment: 
i definitely enjoyed romeoxjuliet and sympathized with the romantic struggle that juliet and romeo suffered together because of their misfortune of being born on opposing sides family-wise. i rejoiced when the civilians got retribution for the inequities of their life and enjoyed the side banter and comedic relief that other characters provided. however, i was rather deterred because of the ending which took me by surprise in a ""this is related to the story... how?"" kind of way which made me leaving the anime a bit disappointed because the story thus far was stunning 
overall: 
it is a work of its own although it shares a common name with shakespeare's play.

                 NOTE: THERE WILL BE MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW! 
             From the intricate plot of the story to the emotional characters, to the greatly-drawn characters, and to the great background music,this anime has to be one of my favorites, or perhaps even rank number one on the anime list on MyAnimeList.Net.  
              The story of this anime, as mentioned before in the previous paragraph, was weaved together intricately with each event &quot;fitting&quot; perfectly with the next (that may not have made much sense, but what I was trying to say was that the events in the story are very well made). One such example of a perfect &quot;fitting&quot; event would be at the beginning when Juliet arrived at home, took off her hat, and got her hair brushed by Cordelia. This event was soon followed by the introduction of other characters, and so it fitted with the story. The only one aspect of the plot of Romeo x Juliet which I did not like was the introduction and the explanation of Escalus, the tree &quot;goddess&quot;. I didn't like it because the artists or director of this anime only used a few short scenes to explain what Escalus really was. It would've been better if the director spent half of an episode to explain the origins of Escalus, or how Escalus actually works, etc...Besides from Escalus, I thought that the plot of RomeoxJuliet was excellent. 
               I thought that the art of this anime was somehow different than any of the other art in other animes because of many reasons. First, the eyes of the characters were drawn with less emphasis on the eyes; this is different from those &quot;sparkly&quot; characters from other romance anime. Second, the action scenes were much better drawn because more colors were used to emphasize blood, or other &quot;casualties&quot; of fighting. One such example of this is the ending, when Romeo bled and blood fell out from his body. The blood from his body were well-detailed.  
                Lastly, the characters and the sound of the story had many strong points and many weak points to them. I will explain the sound first. The background music of the anime gave me the feeling of that scene. One such example was when Romeo and Juliet lived in that village. The music of that scene was sad, but at the same time it had a loving feeling to it. That made me feel very connected to how Romeo and Juliet were feeling about each other. I didn't really like the background music of the ending scene because it gave me tears :D!!! I thought that the characters of Romeo and Juliet were very well-made to fit into the environment of the anime. This is probably because the director made the character do certain things that would fit into the story, such as having them go to balls and fighting. If the director were to make them practice magic with a staff (like the ones in Mahou Sensei Negima), then the characters would've been an &quot;awkward&quot; addition to the story. Asides from the two main characters, I thought that the other characters were very well detail, except for the gardener of Escalus. As mentioned in the plot paragraph, the director or artists of this anime did not really focus much on Escalus and how it works. This explanation would go toward the gardener character, too.  
                   Overall, I thought this anime was a very sweet, tender, and loving anime that anyone can learn to love. Romeo. Juliet. Forever.

    Story: about 6.8, really, but 7 was a bit too high. 
As has been mentioned, RxJ is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. I too, would like to draw attention to the word ADAPTATION. Meaning, any Shakespeare purists who would complain about a butchering of Shakespeare's original, should steer clear, now. From the first episode, it is evident that the plot is totally different, and this really could have been a very good thing.  
Instead, two key things were not handled well, and it turned out to be at best a good thing, with misgivings. First, if they're going to throw in the Tree subplot(if you watch, you'll see what this means by about the middle(around episode 12?)), please explain it better throughout, and not toss in the hurried explanation towards the end. I personally am very fond of fantasy stories, and appreciated the explanation about the tree's purpose(if you've read JRR Tolkien's the Silmarillion, it parallels a part of this). The random :cough: gardener was also...random, and severely underdeveloped. Her purpose felt really contrived. 
Also, Montague, Romeo's father. As mentioned by many, his character is so extremely the one dimensional evil villain...and then they try to save his one dimensionality by also cramming in a ""sad"" backstory at the breakneck ending. Except, again, cramming does not a good story make. Definitely does not get his character any sympathy either.  
If these two elements of Montague and the Tree's importance were better integrated, then Romeo x Juliet fantasy could have been much better. 
Art: Being a poor judge of art, and very not creative to the max, I can't really say much. But it was smooth enough, and never made me wince about how the characters are drawn(with a few exceptions of Juliet's nose). Much unlike...:cough: Naruto fisheye shots :cough: 
Sound: Props to Juliet and Romeo's seiyuus, also to Tybalt's, Willy's, and Montague's. Juliet and Romeo's seiyuus felt like they grew into the roles, and seemed to express more emotion, especially when calling the other lover's name, as the series continued. Tybalt=Byakuya nii-sama=win.(total bias, forgive me). Montague's deep/sonorous voice also suited his despotic character. Kazuhiko Inoue as Willy in a flowery voice was also amusing. 
Otherwise, the opening and its sibling english cover of ""You Raise me Up"" was very memorable, as mentioned. Soundtrack, not so much. 
Characters: Minus major points for the random Gardener, and Montague, as mentioned in story. Otherwise, none of the characters really made me go GACK, and I was definitely shocked and sad at the ending of the two lovers. None really stood out either though. Tybalt was shoved to the side for so many episodes! Mercutio also! That is not good. 
Enjoyment: As I'll tell all my close friends, I'm very much a closet romantic and big sucker for sap. Combine sap with my more boyish love of fantasy, sword fights, save the world and such, and you've got a very very enjoyable anime for me. Again, minus a point simply for how much the Gardener and Montague made me wtf through the middle.  
This is pretty personal though, and most of the population I've met think cliche=cliche=bad, and especially rolled all into a ball like this. 
Overall: 8...6 or so? More than 8, but if we remove the wtf, then I'd actually be raving about this anime as one my top favorites. It isn't quite that, sadly. 
Again worth mentioning though, for me, the ending was really beautiful and poignant, and a very good close. It managed to actually make me miss Romeo, who spent most of the story as an unreformed Suzaku-falsely happy, preaching love and peaceful things, and doing a whole lot of nothing.

    First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile. 
------ 
✦Story 
Hmm, what can I say. To be honest I've never seen any of the more ""classical"" adaptions of Romeo X Juliet story, nor the original. So this is for the most part my first experience with such story. It's possible I've seen similar things but simply with different title. Point here remains that this is my actual first ""Romeo X Juliet"" experience. 
Anyhow, I did find the progression in the story just fine. Although the contents I found oddly boring. It is suppose to be tragic love story. Which I understand, especially how it was bound to be wrapped up, but in the end became less tragic. 
Biggest question here still for me is. Why is their relationship tragic, why should offsprings care what their parents did. I just cannot understand it. I mean, if my love of the life would be actually a daughter of a serial murderer that also killed my family. I just wouldn't care, yes hate probably the criminal, but that would be limited to that criminal. Not automatically hate the whole family tree. Same as with respect, is with hate. To get it, you have to earn it. 
Aside that, I can say, I finished this series instead of dropping for a very simple stories. I absolutely love love, and idealize and thrive for vanilla love. So in that aspect it was enjoyable show. Had some cute scenes and their relationship was okay for the most part. But yeah as mentioned, for the most part I found the story and lot of plot points quite moronic if not annoying. 
Moral of the story is that story wasn't bad, it just didn't impress me. 
✦Art & Sound 
Visuals were okay. Good enough. 
As for sound, once again, writing review weeks after finishing the series, which means I cannot really remember details anymore. And I cannot  remember it being either bad or good. So probably that means most of the tracks were okay'ish. But some had actually quite a presence, which means ""sound"" aspect was good enough. 
✦Character 
Well, not fan of whole ""stage play"" acting. Find em oddly annoying. Especially by how they speak or act. Thankfully this anime didn't have such ""acting"" as much I imagined it would have. But to be honest, no characters really impressed me. 
Probably only one I can think of is that theater story writer. Rest were either boring just simply with no presence. 
Our main coupling wasn't as interesting either. There was some growth and progression regarding the characters within the story, but in the end I found the characters ""meh"" valued. 
✦Enjoyment & Overall 
To sum it up all. It was quite a mediocre series for me. Didn't enjoy much, saw multiple stupid elements, didn't really get into characters nor in general got much impressed. 
As said, if this series wouldn't had romance element (+vanilla coupling) I would quite likely dropped it by the episode of 10. So yeah, some cute moments. Sums it up for me.

    Plot & Story Line  
First thing's first. The anime doesn't follow the exact story line of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. There are not two influential families in (Neo) Verona, only one, which is the Montague family. They took over the rule over Neo Verona by slaughtering the whole ruling family, the family of Capulet, 14 years ago. One of the few survivors of that night was the true heir to the throne, Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet who was later on hidden by loyalists in wish to, one day, overthrow the Montagues and take over the rule over Neo Verona.  
Juliet would eventually find out the truth on her 14th birthday but even though she never knew what had happened to her family she tired to protect the people of Verona as the Red Whirlwind. She is basically a Red, European version of Zorro from the movie The Mask of Zorro (I guess we all know that one). 
And there's also that part when she meets Romeo, the prince of Neo Verona, son of the man that murdered her family. But of course, they don't know that yet and fall madly in love. In addition to that, an ancient prophecy will also try to get in the way of their love but will they be able to actually 'defy the stars'? Now, in my opinion, the anime would have been truly amazing if it weren't for the prophecy/fantasy part and here's all why.  
First of all, let's talk about the story in general. It was outstanding. The whole part about hiding Juliet until she is fourteen and then coming up with a plan to take over the throne was both intriguing and exciting. I just love what anime do to classics like this one. Gonzo Studios turned a romance tale into an action/fantasy drama that should definitely be seen. If only I had seen it before but I always though that the anime would be only about the romance.  
Secondly, Juliet as the Red Whirlwind was amazing. A strong and fierce swordsman fighting for justice in her hometown. Not only is she accounting for most of the thrilling action in the anime but also building up a strong relationship to her people which would be of uttermost importance in the end of the anime. Her fight for justice is what is giving the people of Neo Verona hope that a better time will come and I was truly happy and excited to see how her destiny literary guides her all the time.  
The romance was of course an indispensable part of the story and it was as cheesy as I expected it to be, but it was still nice. Their relationship might look like love at first sight but you can actually see how it develops trough the anime. It is not forced nor rushed and as cheesy as it might be I must admit that I enjoyed it for most of the time.  
And now the part that I didn't like that much. As the anime progresses, a prophecy is slowly introduced to the viewers in a really intriguing way and I was definitely excited to see where it goes. But as it turned into a supernatural/fantasy I slowly lost interest. Not because it was bad, I love fantasy, but it just didn't fit into the whole story. It was too much and in my opinion the anime would have been ten times better if it stayed that way. A realistic setting of two families fighting for the throne and a young love in between was truly enough for Romeo x Juliet to be a masterpiece, but it was not.  
Still, I cannot deny that the story is brilliant with or without the fantasy part and I'd really like to add that it is better than most of the anime stories I have seen recently.  
I might not remember the Juliet from Shakespeare's play, it's been way too long since I read it but I definitely love the anime version of her. As I said in many of my posts, my favorite type of characters are those amazing, fierce, strong and independent female characters and Juliet definitely made it to the top. She is all that and still a sweet and caring person that is not afraid to take the lead when it comes to fighting for her people. Romeo's personality was just as great. Just a sweet, down-to-earth prince that is trying to change the way his father rules over Verona. He was a great support to Juliet and a well written character despite his somewhat cliche personality. Many of the side characters were equally as well presented in the anime and I'd like to mention three: Cordelia, who was a mother/older sister figure for Juliet. She was such a sweet character and a great support to Juliet in her hardest times. Tybalt is a mysterious character that joins the Capulets later in the show. It is his secretive personality and his history that make him stood out among the other characters And in the end, Romeo's father Laertes Montague.  From the looks to his behavior, he was the perfect antagonist and scary as hell if I may add.   
Animation and Style 
It is really interesting to see how the design of anime animation evolves from let's say the 1990's over the 2000's and from the 2010's to now. Just by looking at the design,  not the animation quality, you can predict what year an anime is approximately from. What I dislike about Romeo x Juliet is not the animation quality (it is 2007 so I cannot compare it to today's animation) but the dull colors in the anime. I have the feeling that the makers somehow decreased the saturation of the whole anime. Still, I must mention that there are many beautiful scenes and backgrounds in the anime that I loved especially the flower beds. The character design was also great so on the whole, the animation and style were actually pretty good.  
Conclusion 
The story of Romeo and Juliet has been told so many times but is seems that the world will never get enough of it. Tragic or not (no spoilers 😉), it is a story that gives people hope that love can defeat any evil. Romeo x Juliet is the same yet a completely different tale set in a fantasy version of Verona that is waiting for the return of the righteous heir of the throne, the daughter of Capulet. The story is so much more than a simple drama or romance. It is a story about freedom in every sense of this word that is both emotional and thrilling at the same time. I might not like the fantasy part about the prophecy, thinking that the story would have been better if it remained in a somewhat realistic setting, but it still far from not being good. It was amazing.  
So, to all you having doubts that Romeo x Juliet is just a cheesy romance anime, it is. But it is at the same time so much more. Don't miss it, I am sure that you will enjoy it as much as I did.

    For a while now, I've been alternating between watching newer and older anime. While I do think it's important to keep up with the great stuff that's coming out more recently, something I failed to do for quite a while, I also think checking out stuff from the past, especially ones a lot of people haven't seen, is a worthwhile exercise too. I'd heard decently good buzz from other critics on ""Romeo x Juliet"", and I like the Bard alright, so I gave it a watch. 
My highest praise for this series, oddly enough, has to go to the dubbing stuff, most especially the writers. They easily could have just translated the dialogue into English and be done with it, but instead they not only used Shakespeare-appropriate dialogue wherever they could, they also fit it into iambic pentameter, the rhythm of dialogue consistent throughout much of his work. It genuinely elevates the work, not only connecting it better to the source material but also giving the words that some poetic quality that makes a good Shakespeare performance worthwhile. It also goes without saying that the cast is good as well, with Brina Palencia as Juliet herself doing a great job, she really captures both the gravitas and the humanity of the character. 
I'm also one-hundred percent behind their alterations to the story. Pulling in other Shakespeare plot elements, such as cross-dressing women and corrupt monarchs who must be overthrown, feels natural, and the way it recasts their romance by changing the power dynamic is interesting. Both leads are also made more compelling characters: Juliet's vigilantism and idealism makes her likable; Romeo's astonishing levels of compassion makes him a cute love interest for her. The very fact that it is Juliet, not Romeo, who leads much of the story is a great way to tell the story. The romance between the two, while still playing heavily on ""Love at First Sight"", develops at a reasonable pace, and I'm happy they spend more than half the series actively in love with the other, and not just pining. The whole plot to overthrow the tyrannical regime also worked well for me, at least in concept. 
Where this series fell flat for me the most was how it handled the conclusion. Rather than develop the strong ideas it had at the start, it instead skipped past much of the intrigue or warcraft to instead tie everything to the science-fiction/fantasy roots of the setting, which I was never a huge fan of in the first place. Neo Verona was okay, but I feel like the story would have worked just as well in something more mundane, the fantasy was never a huge sell for me. By the end, the story gets so far into the minutia of its world that the plot and characters suffer, and with it my interest plummeted. It isn't like this was the prettiest show on the planet (in fact it was fairly middling work from an already lower-rate studio), and while it has a fantastic OP (it took me quite a while to figure out it was a cover of a famous English song) and ED the music isn't something that blew me away either. The ending soured me on the entire experience so much that a series I'd hoped would end up a favorite of mine instead equaled out to just be sort of okay. If you're someone who thinks the premise sounds neat, than I'd recommend giving it a few episodes and seeing if it sticks in your brain, but otherwise it really isn't worth going out of your way to see. It's a fine show, but not a very remarkable one.

    As far as I know, every person in all parts of the world has heard of the Shakespeare story that is Romeo & Juliet, either through reading it while in high school, seen it been parodying a few times on TV, featured on the silver screen with the 1939 George Cukor film, the 349 Franco Zeffirelli film, the 1996 Baz Luhrmann MTV-inspired film and other numerous amount of films and media that either have parallel situations too many to count (and yes, that does include Romeo Must Die or Gnomeo & Juliet). But what if anime had a turn with the play? Can it turn out to be good or like the Three Musketeers adaptation directed by Paul WS Anderson, it could go downhill from here? 
The plot is still quite similar to the play with some major differences to the play. The Capulets and Montagues are still feuding adversies like in the play but unfortunately for the Capulets, they don’t have a lasting appearance even during the start of the series. Leontes Montague and his men led a bloody coup and murdered every member of the Capulet family, with the exception of one person and yes, it is Juliet Fiammatta Arst De Capulet also known as Odin, when she disguises herself as a boy with short hair. She also masquerades as a vigilante by the name of the Red Whirlwind, who swore to aid the people who suffer from the reign of Lord Montague and his men. However, here comes Romeo Candore De Montague, who is generally the polar opposite of his father. He is kind-hearted, obedient, and noble and as you may guess, he and Juliet start to fall for each other. 
This is actually quite a change-up for the better. The gender roles here might be switched as the primary focus in the series is Juliet. In other adaptations and the original play, Juliet is mainly the shy and meek girl but in here, she’s a very strong, independent, and well-thought out character and is actually quite likable. 
Romeo, on the other hand, is really not that interesting at first, but he does get to that point where everything starts to fall into place. Another change from the play, while Juliet is arranged to be married to Count Paris; in the anime, Romeo is the one to be arranged married with Hermione, a young noblewoman from the House of Borromeo, and yet she’s not really a character from the play. Most of their characters in the story are borrowed from other Shakespeare plays. 
Other characters include Cordelia, Juliet’s best friend since childhood and also the representation of the unnamed nurse in the play; Conrad, captain of the Capulet Guards and the one who saved Juliet from the massacre; Francisco and Curio, a duo part of Juliet’s friends who fought alongside her; Tybalt, a mysterious warrior (also a vigilante) also has a deep-seated hatred for Lord Montague (and one of the reasons I can’t reveal to you. It is, after all, a spoiler); Antonio, Juliet’s sidekick; & William, a playwright whose works have not been well-received and also has allusions and pictured as a caricature to William Shakespeare; Benvolio, one of Romeo’s close friends; Mercutio, an sly noble who wants to become Montague’s heir due and soon become mostly like him, mainly because Titus, his father, is an degenerate alcoholic and Mercutio is often ashamed of him. 
The only slight problem I had in the series is the villains, who are just insanely evil just to be insanely evil. They obviously don’t care that people are rebelling against them and the fact they are just being dicks. They have no motivation but just to do what they want to do and that’s it. 
The music score is well-made and appropriately goes along with the series. The opening song, ""Inori~You Raise Me Up〜"" (祈り〜You Raise Me Up〜)?) by Lena Park, is a love ballad with some inspirational moments in there, overall, it’s a nice song. I did like the first ending song ""Cyclone"" (サイクロン)?) by 12012 and occasionally I did sort of sing the lyrics by myself…….horribly. The second ending song ""Good Bye, Yesterday"" by Mizrock is decent but I still like the other one better. I’m surprised GONZO did the animation to this series since I have only previously watched another GONZO-made series (Afro Samurai) and I loved that one.  The animation looks impressive in the first half of the series while some quality drop, it still held its ground. 
FINAL VERDICT: It may have gone through some changes in story, characters, and atmosphere; it did work out for the better and leaving only little and meaningless flaws IMO. This is one of the romantic forms of media that doesn’t come off too cheesy, overrated and only alienates different audiences. I really did like this series for what it was. If Hollywood learns to do an adaptation with different elements thrown in and do it right, they should follow Romeo X Juliet’s example.

    Much of what I would write has already been written about this being a vey interesting twist on a classic story, so instead I will focus on how much fun this was for a Shakespeare fan.  While the differences are obvious, the play with which the writers made of the classic script was rather interesting.  Romeo X Juliet is filled with literary references to the original as well as to other works of the Shakespeare.   
Often times side comments made in jest were excuses to allude to actual phrases from the original.  For example, Mercutio telling Hermione that Juliet might have gone after ""the object of her idolatry"" is a direct reference to the following line of Juliet's from Act II of the play  ""Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee"".   
That is just one taste.  I apologize if this wasn't as useful a review in terms of giving a full account of the anime, but as I said, others have done that well enough.  I just thought this aspect of the anime shouldn't be overlooked for those who enjoy the Elizabethan era writer. 
As an aside:  I did not like the opening theme and any of the similar style of music that sometimes cropped up in the anime.  I just dislike that disney style whitney houston diva singing.  The rest of the soundtrack is fine.

    What can I say, I pretty much fell in love with it within the first few episodes. 
I immediately looked at the plot as soon as I saw the title. I have never read Romeo and Juliet but I know the general story, and I must admit, the plot captured my heart and I started watching it right away. I love the development in the relationship between Romeo and Juliet. A forbidden love that wasn't supposed but did, in a way it was a beautiful thing. I expected to competently follow the original story, but I was quite wrong, it really had a big fantasy element and I actually think it made the story way better then it would have been if it had followed Shakespeare's original story. A floating island in the sky, a magical tree that keeps that island alive, dragon steeds and godesses are defiantly not part of Shakespeare's work, but it made the anime that much more enjoyable. For me though, as much as it was a ""happy"" and ""exciting"" anime, it was also a bit tragic. There were a few times when I was like ´ Д｀~noo! but there  were also many times I was like ⌒▽⌒ ~yay! I won't spoil anything, but the ending really is a moving but tearful one (well, it was for me anyways).  
The art at first ind of caught me off guard. It's like a semi realistic type of anime compared to just normal, skinny, big eyed anime. I honestly didn't like it at first, but you get used to it and in a way it grows on you. The backdrops were nice though, the castles and the rest of the kingdom were drawn really good and it showed the historical element of the show quite well.  As it is, I am a bit of a sucker for historical anime and manga, and when the art doesn't look very historical and nice then I am completely turned off, but this anime was drawn quite appropriately to fit the time period of the anime was set in. 
As for the sound, I give it a thumbs up. The opening them was so beautiful and I sill listen to it now, and every time I hear it all I can think of is the anime. I watched the anime dubbed, so I don't know how the sound was in Japanese, but the actual story of Romeo and Juliet takes place in Europe, so of course the anime did too. So, to suit the time and setting they used the ""Old English"" when talking . Sometimes I found it a bit hard to grasp what they were saying because of the way they talked, but for the most part I understood and it really helped give the anime the historical factor. 
I loved the character development. As I said the relationship development between Romeo and Juliet was really good. It was paced just right, never to fast and never to slow. Seeing them fall in love throughout the anime and watching them over come all the hardships and challenges they faced together was great and kept me on the edge of my seat in a way. I also liked how the director didn't try to over include the supporting cast. Sometimes they can be too much and too overpowering for their role but in Romeo X Juliet the supporting cast was there just to be the supporting cast and that was really good. All of the characters did their part in the anime and all fit their role perfectly. 
Overall I think I have made it fairly clear that I very much so enjoyed this anime and it is definitely one of favorites. If you are looking for a great romance and  historical anime with some fantasy and action, you will love Romeo X Juliet! ^.^

    This review will contain one or two spoilers, but they don't give a lot away. 
STORY-6 
The anime does NOT follow the original play by Shakespeare, so if you're hoping for that, watch one of the live action movies or read the play.  In this, Escalus is a tree, okay?  He.  Is.  A.  Tree.  Paris isn't even in this, so there's no fight between him and Romeo which I did miss, but whatever.  The dialogue is close to what they would've said in Shakespeare's day, but, other times, it's more modern.  They do make it so that the average person is able to understand what the hell is going on though.  If you haven't read Shakespeare before, it's quite easy to understand when it's being spoken.  Yes, the characters do use really formal language, but you WILL get used to it.  There are also a few plot holes, but they're nothing too major.  If you think of a different solution than the characters, then, yep, you found a plot hole, congratulations. 
It does stick to the Shakespeare ending of his play, but there is a twist to it, BUT, when it happens, you actually will be more understanding of their feelings than in the play. 
ART-8 
The background was beautifully designed.  The buildings were drawn professionally, I could actually see them being real.  All of the landscapes and buildings actually looked old or new, depending on the age.  Cracks were added to certain structures to add realism while cleanliness was added to the newer structures.  All the fog/mist added to certain scenes added a nice touch to the mood.  The roads were quite detailed, especially the dirt ones, you could see all the tracks etched into it.  The flowers were drawn quite beautifully and, whenver one was on screen, I could help but look at them because they really are eye-catching.  This may just be the pyromaniac in me, but the fire was both realistic and cartoonish at times. 
The character designs left something to be desired compared to the rest of the art.  For example, even though she had to dress up as a boy for so many years, Juliet's design could've been more girlish when she wasn't in her boy's costume.  She just always maintains the boyish aspect in her face and shoulders.  Even before she really knew the truth about her past, Juliet always looked like the war between the Montagues and the Capulets had affected her.  She looked like she remembered her parent's deaths, even though I doubt she did since she was only about two at the time.  I believe that Juliet's constant companion, Cordelia (I believe she was four at the time), should've had a slightly more depressed look since she'd be the best candidate out of the two to remember what had happened that night.  I cannot ignore the fact that Cordelia does have the mature motherly look about her which was a good touch.  In my opinion, the best character design was Montague's.  He looks like the guy who has everything, but still wants more.  His design leaves little to be desired since it fits his personality perfectly. 
SOUND-9 
Voices:  I've seen the series in both English and Japanese and like them both equally.  They both convey about the same amount of emotion and the casts were both fantastic.  It doesn't matter which of the two languages you watch it in, so just go for whatever language you prefer. 
Music:  It fit the mood and the time period almost perfectly.  There were times when it was more like the 1800's or 1900's than the late 1500's or early 1600's. 
Sound Effects:  All of them were fairly accurate to whatever happened that needed a sound effect. 
CHARACTER-7 
The main characters really do get some development, but I can't really say how much since it varies from character to character.  Most of the characters, even a few of the minor ones, have a backstory and a will that drives them.  You rarely question why they did something.  The only time you come to question them is in the final few episodes when every deision is made within moments that you barely have any idea what they're thinking.  One of the characters I enjoyed watching was William himself since he gave some good advice.  I also enjoyed the Father, especially in episode 5 when he described humans. 
The characters sometimes act predictably, but, it's primarily a shojo, don't expect unpredictable behavior. 
ENJOYMENT-6 
There were some parts I did like, yet there were a lot of aspects I didn't enjoy.  There were things that didn't make any sense at all.  If you do watch this anime, you just have to go with the flow and acccept everything. 
OVERALL-7 
It has action for the boys, romance for the girls, it's a great mix.  It doesn't matter if you're a boy or girl to enjoy this anime, if you like twists on original stories, then watch it and don't care what your friends think (yes, boys, I mean you).  Watch it with your husband/wife, girlfriend/boyfriend, group of friends, the household pet, random hobo, whoever you want!  Just go with the flow and, remember, suicide is NEVER the answer.

    Quien no ha leido esta maravillosa obra del maestro Shakespire?, bueno de hecho yo no y creo que hay muchos como yo pero eso no es un crimen o si? XD, en todo caso, esta adaptacion al anime ofrece maravillosas escenas, la trama envolvente en donde se dan las disputas entre llos capuleto y los montesco pero desde otro enfoque mas fantastico y mitico que el hallado en la novela orginal (que no la haya leido no quiere decir que no sepa de que trata XD) el sonido es maravilloso, realmente conmovedor y en general la trama se encarga de envolver totalmente al espectador desde todo punto de vista. Una maravillosa animacion de los estudios Gonzo :D

    This seem to be the most enjoyable version of Romeo and Juliet by far. Don't get me wrong, Shakespeare's work is amazing but this has a great twist and time difference. 
Well when you first start off watching it, the Artwork is amazing which brings you into the story like its a normal thing other then thinking about ""dragon horse???"" it makes you accept it and other things cause how well it goes into the story. 
Now what really got me are the OP & ED theme songs, they are great and this is the first time i actually keep watching it for each episode instead of fast-forwarding it. 
Well i cant really say much but its a must see. wow i actually said it -.-

    My most favourite anime I have ever seen and I have seen over 50 anime shows.I loved the overall show. It had a bit of everything in it. Romance, adventure, action, fantasy. A real tear-jerker at the end of the series though. The anime is more serious then comical however I was still obsessed with it for ages and have even re-watched the entire series. It was so exciting and I could even feel how the characters felt. The overall script was also very clear and easy to understand. 
So I HIGHLY recommend this to ANYONE!!!! 
(P.S. This is my first ever review. Hope I helped)

    To begin with, this is a fantastical remake of the original. Though different, RxJ manages to convincingly simplify and capture the mood and ideas of the Shakespearean original. 
Story and Character: 
The first half of the series is a riot of emotions. The story begins with the all-too-familiar scene of love at first sight, secret rendezvous and eventual escape/elopement. Romeo and Juliet are your typical tragic hero and heroine; faced against insurmountable odds, yet remain true to themselves and their beliefs. Makes you wanna root for them. Although this ideal scenario does seem kinda cheesy at times, it makes for good romance. And heck, what's a Romeo and Juliet remake without filling it up with sweet romanticism? 
The second half is a slow and torturous climb to the climax. Here, the main characters, and subsequently you, will suffer their repeated separation and reunion, and their final clash of swords and ideals. The second half can get slightly confusing at times, especially when the fantastical elements come into play. It is also much slower paced compared to the earlier half, which might lead to some impatience from the viewers. My suggestion is to treat it as a deliberate attempt to allow us to understand what the main characters felt when they pined for each other. 
In short, don't be too cynical of the plot (and plot holes) and try to enjoy this for what it is - a love story.  
Not fantastic, but no gripes here, except that it can be quite inconsistent. 
If you are a fan of classical or instrumental music, you are in for an aural treat. RxJ soundtrack is unbelievably good. This is not surprising since the composer Sakimoto-san also worked on Final Fantasy's and Dragon Quest's soundtracks. The OP and ED were also really well selected. The OP is a soulful Japanese rendition of ""You Raise Me Up"", setting up the mood of the show, while the EDs ""Cyclone"" and ""Goodbye, Yesterday"" fitted the hectic progression in the first half and the painstaking second half. In fact, I recommend listening to its soundtrack and re-imagining the story based on the music alone. Let loose your creativity and come up with your own version of RxJ along with the soundtrack, with each track representing a scene or an act in your imaginary play.  
In conclusion, if you are looking for a dramatic anime with pure love against stacked odds, look no further. 
It seems obligatory that I have to end with a short poetic abstract of RxJ. A tribute to its origins of sorts.  
-SPOILER ALERT- 
In fair Verona, where laid the scene. 
From ancient grudge breaks new mutiny, 
Where civil blood made hands unclean. 
From forth offspring of two foes, 
Cruel fate brought close their souls. 
Through the fearless journey of their death-marked love, 
Could the people of Verona reclaim earth and hearth. 
Thus the star-crossed lovers staked their life, 
With their death buried all vengeance and strife. 
And so ceased all suffering, hate, and rage, 
A close was brought to this bloodied stage. 
""In life and in death we shall be 
together forever till eternity."" 
~Romeo x Juliet 
-END OF SPOILER- (Don't worry, I doubt it will diminish your watching experience if you do accidentally read this.)

    This anime displays the ever so classic, Romeo and Juliet a play written by the ever so famous play-writer in history, William Shakespeare.... With a twist!~ 
On this anime, charming prince Romeo is part of the royal family of Montague, while beatiful Juliet is the rogue helping people, and once a member of the noble Capulet family before her family was murdered. This twist, really got me attracted. It shows the typical romance and trials they had to get past, in this medieval world. It also has mystical creatures and fictional events that come into play. And displays some politics, &  corruption during this time. With all these in, they even add the little romance that Romeo and Juliet had, being the noble and the rogue, they couldn't simply show their love. The ending is the same as the original, sorrowful, it hurt me, I knew that was coming, one reason why I didn't finish it but it's still an amazing, epic story of how a person would go so far for someone they love. Even with that sad part, I still love the anime. 
 If you love the renaissance period and if you like the plays of Shakespeare, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this one.

    When I heard of a great Shakespeare play becoming an anime, I was extremely excited. I am truly sorry to say this kind of let me down. Of course, it IS an anime, it should have twists and be awesome (like any good anime) but I just did NOT get it. It had a great first few episodes, the heart racing kind, then it went a little downhill... After about episode 8, everything (I mean everything) I could see anything that was coming a mile away. Cliche does not even begin to describe it. I believe this had a lot of potential, but it is pretty hard to describe why without spoilers. If you think this is for you, you go ahead! I just think they missed the mark on this one.

    Japan, in its history of filmmaking, has adapted Shakespeare's works. There are those which are pretty good (Throne of Blood) and there are those which are glorious masterpieces (Ran). This anime version of Romeo & Juliet falls kind of somewhere between. The story centres around the forbidden love people are familiar with. 
BUT WAIT. What's this, everyone is now on floating island? There are horses that can fly? 
Ok, fine. it sounds like the worst idea imaginable, I know, but there are forces at work here which make this series pretty good on the whole. The central characters (not just our titular pair) are well written and developed, the animation stands out quite well, given Gonzo's reputation for sometimes letting a few mistakes slip into previous works. 
The key thing above all things, however, is the english dub, which does something the original japanese does not. It adapts the script into Shakesperean dialogue, which just makes everything just seem right. But, you say, the voice acting is probably inferior? Nothing could be further from the truth. To be honest with anyone reading this, Romeo & Juliet in my view is a strong contender for having the best dub (alongside Black Lagoon, Kill la Kill, Toradora!, Excel Saga, Baccano! and Steins:Gate) ever recorded.

    Romeo x Juliet 
This anime shares it's name and renaissance Verona setting with Shakespeare's tragedy. That's where their similarities end. Most of the characters have the same name as the ones in the original work but their personalities, actions and life expectancy are entirely different. Most obvious difference would be that anime Romeo x Juliet follows the structure of greek tragedy as much a Naruto does, and there isn't a trace of that foul and stingy Shakespearean comedy. There might be some scenes that reference the original, but since I'm not a Shakespeare fan, I only recognized a ridiculous balcony scene that serves more as a reference pun than a plot advancing scene. 
Capulets ruled Neo Verona until Romeo's dad slaughtered them all except Juliet and usurped the duke's seat. 10 or so years later Juliet is a freedom fighter fighting Montague's tyranny with the help of remaining Capulet supporters. Romeo is a ruler's son flying around worrylessly on his pegasus (yeah, he has one). I will divide the story into three parts: romance, action and fantasy storyline. 
First would be the romantic storyline that follows Romeo and Juliet's relationship. 
It's a pure love story about them falling in love and transcending social boundaries that separate them. There aren't love-triangles or similar plot devices so I was never frustrated, it's just a really nice and beautiful love story.  
Love without much drama sounds boring, but that's where the action/political part kicks in. Neo Verona is under rule of a tyrant so we get to enjoy the suffering of the lower classes and resistance members clashing with the city guards resulting in violent swordplay and high speed chases across the streets and roofs of Neo Verona. We're also shown some court intrigues surrounding Montague and other nobles. I'd compare this part of Romeo x Juliet with Rose of Versailles or BBC/HBO/RAI tv series Rome. Even though it's nowhere near as great as the aforementioned series, it should be an interesting watch for anyone who likes historical dramas infused with some action. 
The fantasy storyline deals with a goddess and a flying continent. Neo Verona is a small continent floating in the sky due to influence of some godly forces that also maintain the natural balance of the continent. This part of RxJ serves almost no purpose until the last two episodes, it is painfully underdeveloped und totally unnecessary. I like fantasy anime and literature but from this sentence on, I will pretend that RxJ has no fantasy stuff except that the horses are replaced with pegasi. 
The best part of RxJ is Juliet, one of my favourite female anime characters. She can stand her own in a fight with any male in the series and is a resistance leader loved and respected by both her followers and more passive citizens of Neo Verona. I've watched a lot of anime where ""strong"" girls shut away their feminine side and end up waiting for the wimpy guy to save them when real problems arise, but Juliet is different, she's always true to her emotions and always chooses her own path. It might seem she's a mary sue from what my fanboyish mind wrote above, but I wouldn't classify her as one as she tends to screw up when she's ""choosing her own path"" (though my uderstanding of what mary sue is might be somewhat questionable).  
The other main is obviously Romeo, he's a skinny pacifist that I can't say much about because he's hardly noticeable due to Juliet's awesomeness.  
There's a wide variety of side characters, they probably won't become your favourites but they're fleshed out well enough to keep the story interesting. 
Art and sound 
Art and animation aren't groundbreaking but I find them above average. Neo Verona looks great, it doesn't have Assassins Creed's Florence or Venice level of detail but it still looks beautiful and it's easy to imagine oneself living in it. Charater design is ok, I liked it but there was some ""I've seen these characters before somewhere"" moments. Animation is fluid during the action scenes. 
Sound is nothing special, japanese voice actors did a solid job, except when pronouncing character's names, but I guess you can't expect a Japanese that doesn't speak italian to pronounce Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet without any problems. Background music was ok, as I neither felt irritated by it nor felt it's absence. They used Raise me up a couple of times so I had to mute the sound since I hate the song (I also dislike the usage of modern music in mediums that use a quasi historical setting). 
Overall 
When you remove it's obvious influences from the picture, Romeo x Juliet is a very good action romance anime set in a detailed renaissance-looking city with a loveable heroine and an interesting story featuring political intrigues, revolution and an ""awww"" kind of love. I gave it a 9 because of Juliet being so awesome, but you can considered it an 8 if you think this review sounds too fanboyish in Juliet related parts.

    I decided to write this review, because today is that day that I finally dropped Romeo x Juliet. I made it to episode 22 of 24. Being very familiar with Shakespear's 'Romeo and Juliet' I wasn't sure whether it was worth watching, but it turned out not too similar to the original, so thats one good point. However, I think the storyline is a bit too ridiculous. When I finally got to the point where the ending was starting to unravel I just couldn't watch any longer. People who have no idea about Shakespear may like this, but for those who do: stay away!

    As a big Shakespeare fan and an even bigger fan of ""Romeo and Juliet"", I have been wanting to watch this series for quite some time. In order to do this, I had to overcome my initial wariness of all the deviations from the original work.  
From the noble origins of the main characters to their ties and relationships with all the other characters as well as the names for some new questionable characters (see Lancelot, Ophelia and even... Hermione!?), I was willing to overcome these changes and additions as they would seemingly make for a more interesting and far more developed story than Shakespeare's original work.  
Nevertheless, this story was far from being truly original itself, for it not only borrowed from Shakespeare, but also from many other well-known tales such as Robin Hood, Les Misérables, and many others. This could, again, be easily ignored for the sake of entertainment, but as the story progresses, more and more random elements come into play, making the anime drift off farther and farther away from the source material. This becomes truly annoying towards the end, where something like ""The Tree of Life"" from Avatar suddenly appears along with a Mayan-style theme concerning sacrifices.  
This could, again, have been easily ignored if it actually made sense and turned the story into an outstandingly fresh piece of work, but, unfortunately, it didn't. 
As if that wasn't enough, at least 3 characters are spared from dying like they did in the original work, for seemingly no purpose whatsoever.  
Additionally, the design of Neo Verona itself is also a mix of a bunch of Italy's best sights along with some influence from other countries. Nevertheless, the art and architecture are generally well executed and enjoyable to look at. Although the animation overall is not outstanding, it is definitely pleasant and fits the overall tone of the story pretty well. The only downside to this would probably be the CGI (ugh, those flags!), but thankfully its use is fairly limited.  
The terrible CGI is compensated with some lovely music, where the opening song is used both in Japanese and in English (though I personally prefer the English version and would have liked to see it played more often throughout the series). The ending songs are also nice, and, while nothing memorable, they give a nice look and feel to the show. (Despite people being ""surprised"" about the first ending since it is kind of a rock song, it's perfect for the large amount of action as well as the darker themes that appear in the series). The soundtrack is also well executed, and, again, while nothing outstanding, it certainly does its job pretty well.  
Another strong point of this anime is definitely the voice acting, for it is of great quality (at least in the original Japanese version). Although I was not familiar with any of the seiyuus' work before, I was pleasantly surprised at what they did with Romeo x Juliet and how it all came together so well. This may also be thanks to the pacing, which, for me, was virtually perfect. Neither too fast nor too slow, this anime takes the right amount of time to develop its story and characters (although Tybalt could have certainly used some more time for his backstory and character development).  
Despite its mishaps, this anime is definitely enjoyable and one well worth watching. Two pieces of advice, though: try to forget that this has anything to do with Shakespeare and watch out for developing an inevitable addiction! Now, what are you waiting for? Go and immerse yourself in the wonderful world of Neo-Verona, where I'm sure you'll be in for a real anime treat!

    Is this truly... a love that can never be?through love....and death... 
I know and we know the story of Romeo x Juliet Shakespear's version with the strange "" oh art thou"" well no of that is in this sweet touching loving story. 
The whole reason why I wanted to watch this was for the of the characters not talking weired,I read the story I seened the play and if you didn't understand the story there like I didn't I decided to watch the anime see if they are the same. A total twist of fate for me because I never thought I would love this version better than the play. 
I enjoyed seeing sword fights,the romance Romeo and Juliet had for each other.The art made the love scenes so mesmerizing and not so cheesy.The story I somewhat different then the original Shakespeare version I mean she's the last Capulet hoping to change the way of Montague's reign of poverty and wealth.ofcourse you meet Romeo and how he met Juliet and how deeply he loves her and the emotion is shown throughout many of the episodes there love is shown,lots of drama,fear,sorrow and heartredfrom the both houses. 
The opening and ending songs are awesome the begining song is still stuck on my head the ending too Lena Park and 12012 steal the opening and ending!! 
The story is different in some ways how it ends is up to you,I for one the sub and dub both made me feel happy they met and up to the end was perfect sweet ending but a tragedy. 
Makes you think about your love...are you happy to have the joy to love someone? 
I hope you do because this touching story that makes you cry because it sure made me the final things they said to eachother T^T 
I just hope you enjoy 10/10

    The series is still continuing but I think that from what I have watched...people, this is a series no one can miss. 
This has to be overall one of the best anime series I have ever seen. Yes, this is Romeo and Juliet but the anime has this complete entertaining twist making maybe the storyline even better than the original. Basically, Montague has taken over &quot;Neo Verona&quot; slaying House Capulet except its sole and only survivor Juliet who must disguise herself as a boy in order to survive. In this harsh and suffering society Juliet meets Romeo and thus the story unfolds. 
This anime has all of your favorites like Mercutio, Benvolio, and even the play writer himself William Shakespeare and a cast of such depth making one question, is this really the &quot;where are thou?&quot; Romeo and Juliet??? I am a person who greatly judges any anime/manga by its storyline and this has to be my favorite anime I have seen this year (well, next to Paprika). I swear Romeo X Juliet will completely surprise you at its art, storyline and music which makes this series positively solid through and through. 
Okay, for you people who are not into the romantic stuff cause it is Romeo and Juliet like myself, trust me there is plenty of action fighting to keep you entertained from your very own heroine (that's right Juliet's the fighter in this one) and the rest of the cast. For the haters (just kidding), there's also romantic stuff for you too.  
This has to be the hidden jewel for 2007 because of what it is, a hated 9th grade final research and journal project Shakespearean play but as you can see from the previous post, the grading score needs to be boosted to at least 20 in order to barely justify the greatness of this masterpiece.

    ""For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo..""  
Well, somewhat.  
Now, at first glance, one would think that this was just another adaptation of the tragic/romantic play.  
However, dear viewers, not all is what it may seem. The creators of this show (and the manga, of which I figure there is one) takes the story and twists it into more of a sort of Hamlet adaptation than a Romeo and Juliet. The forbidden, star-crossed love is still there, but there is now a revenge plot to reclaim what was lost. 
Even so, the story was still entrancing, as were all of the characters. As a Shakespeare fan, I did appreciate a lot of the dialogue as well as the certain nods and nuances to the Bard's play and several characters from his works. Not to mention the Bard himself makes a hilarious cameo. 
The most endearing and appealing part to this show (as well it should be) though, is definitely the two leads. Their interactions are quite heart-felt and incredibly sweet. I will give this show a nod, as it really fleshes out the romance far more than the play ever did. The two characters talk and get to know each other a bit more than the originals did in the entirety of the three days that they knew each other. Even their deaths (oh come on, you knew it would still happen) was far more heartbreaking than it ever was in the play. The play has stupid teenagers not thinking through things. The anime has two young adults sacrificing themselves for the good of all and for love. 
Another creative touch they added to this adaptation was the role reversal of the two leads. It's not Romeo who sneaks into a party, it's Juliet. It's not Romeo who flees to Mantua. It's Juliet. It's quite interesting and a new way to look at the story. I couldn't help but think it made the show far more interesting to see how they would twist the narrative around further. 
My only issue I really had with the show was the way some of the characters were twisted around to benefit the story of this loose adaptation. Sadly, we no longer have the fun-loving witty Mercutio or the villainous, crazed Tybalt. Mercutio was the character I really mourned for. There was a lot of wasted potential on his part. Also, there was a definitive lack of play dialogue. I really was missing one of them saying the famous, 
""My only love sprung from my only hate!!""  
Wasted opportunity there, man. 
In the end, this show is definitely worth a watch, even I would say, for those who love Shakespeare or the play. While it's not a faithful adaptation - heck, it's hardly an adaptation at all - it still retains the spirit and the romance of the play. You still love the characters and you still wish for happiness for the two leads. It's well worth the watch. And you'll definitely either tear up or feel your chest tightening a teeny bit.

    Romeo X Juliet, though the story borrows mostly from the Shakespeare’s story it is presented in a remarkably different way. The story has been changed a little in order to remove overly used cliché moments by making it a somewhat opaque. Due to the fact that this is an anime adaptation, it has been moulded to fit it, by offering mythical beast such as flying horse called Dragon Steeds. 
Story: (9/10) 
The story revolves around our two main characters Romeo and Juliet who are bounded by love but separated by fate. I am impressed on how the story is altered not entirely but in some parts to give it a fresh tone. Each episode ended with a cliffhanger, and each episode felt fairly good. Although it doesn't carry the same tragic feelings on all parts, you can still feel the pain of separation and tenderness. 
Characters: (9/10) 
Though I haven’t really read the original play so I can’t compare, the characters were very well built, each having their own personality. The complexity of each character was splendid. Many of the supporting characters have names from other Shakespeare plays too! 
Sound: (10/10) 
This is where the show really shines. The background music blended perfectly with the scenes, the emotions in them really stood out. As for the ending and opening sequences, I never skipped them; they were just too touching and poignant in some ways. One more thing, the dub, this is first show I would recommend watching dubbed, the English lines are much more related to the old English. The fluid talks and use of old English in some scenes really merged well.  
Art and Animation(7/10) 
The only downside of the show, tough personally it wasn't much of a bother but still the art feels a little bland. But still the brushed out colours matches the setting perfectly. The animation is not so smooth in some part and I felt drop in quality after 15 episodes, but still it didn't took away from the show. 
Conclusion: (9/10) 
I am not a fan of Shakespeare’s work but this adaption really amazed me, the story, characters, sound all blended beautifully to provide and exceptional and lasting impression for me. Though the story deviates from the original and the introduction of fantasy elements might turn away some but if you are not a die-hard fan of Shakespeare and don’t get bothered by change, please watch the show. It is just too good to be ignored.

    ""Till death do us part."" 
Romeo x Juliet, based off of the infamous play by William Shakesphere, tells the heartrending tale of two young nobles, in love, whose country is plagued by war, hatred, and suffering. It is a show that will build you up, break you down, make you laugh, and make you cry. A show that doesn't hesitate to stab you in the emotions, and twist the knife just to make sure. 
The two main characters, after which the show is named, are Romeo and Juliet. Just like the play by Shakesphere, the two meet and fall in love. Unfortunately, their love is that which was never meant to be. The story follows this couple as they try to bring peace to their country, and end this horrific reign of corruption and death. 
A brilliantly paced and executed show, Romeo x Juliet is definitely a must watch for lovers of the romance/history/drama genres. This emotional rollercoaster will constantly keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. 
While the art/music isn't anything to write home about, I couldn't think of a better way to have approached it. A Japanese/English rendition of ""Raise Me Up"" by Josh Groban, coupled with beautifully written violin and piano pieces, fit the general tone of the show. The art gives the characters a youthful look, without giving them that ""moe"" (overexaggerated eyes) look that we see in countless shows today.  
If your definition of a romance show is one that contains ecchi/comedy/harem, look elsewhere. You won't find any of that here. Those of you going into this show should know that this is a serious romance that tells the tragic tale of two lovers whose first love was destined to fail the moment they met. 
Would I recommend this show? You bet. If you are still debating whether or not you should watch this show at this point, just watch it. Trust me, you'll be met with a show that not-your-typical overrated romcom show.

    I discovered this anime by listening to the theme song on an anime playlist I have saved on Youtube. The song is called ""Inori"" - which is the Japanese version of ""You Raise Me Up"", one of my favorite songs. This wasn't the first time I fell in love with a song from an anime that lead me into watching it (""Angel Beats!"", ""The World is Still Beautiful"", ""Uta no Prince Sama""). I dove into the anime and thought ""what could go wrong?"" 
A lot of things apparently.  
First off, I had a really hard time keeping up with this anime because there were some times where it bored me half to death or a character did something pretty stupid. The only character I really enjoyed was Francisco who was one of Juliet's bodyguards. Another thing, Francisco and Curio were far better looking than Romeo, I'm surprised Juliet didn't fall in love with one of them before she met her forbidden lover.  
If anyone knows the original ""Romeo and Juliet"", you know that the two lovers are together at almost all times after they meet. In this spinoff, there were only about five episodes out of the twenty-four where Romeo and Juliet were actually together. That really annoyed because EVERYONE knows Romeo and Juliet as a ROMANCE TRADEGY, but it is very hard for the show to be romantic in any way if the two lovers are always separated.  
On top of that, the two characters who were supposed to be the comical relief characters weren't funny at all, just plain annoying.  
The ending was the worst of all. I know the creators wanted the anime to be a little different from the play, but I just thought the idea of what they came up with was pretty lame. We all know that in the end, Romeo and Juliet commit suicide, but the ending when they DID die was so rushed that I had no idea what was happening. The creators must have put zero thought into the ending given that everyone knows that both Romeo and Juliet die in the end.

    I went into this anime really wanting to like it. And I did - fo about half the show.  
The story is focusing on the classic romance between Romeo and Juliet, and mixes in fantasy elements.  
Juliet starts out as a vigilante-type character who opposes the oppressive rulers, the Montague family, and is in the beinning really cool and driven, who eventually finds out she is the last Capulet - the former rulers of the nation.  
Romeo is the heir of the Montague family and is a compassionate, kind young man who wants to grow up to do the best for the people.  
Now, this sets up a very cool scenario about freedom-fighting and forbidden love, and it really works - in the beginning.  
When the characters inevitably fall for each other it feels like they just don't care about the fight for the people anymore and the plot feels a lot flatter after about the halfway mark...  
And I won't spoil anything, but what the heck was up with that ending? It just felt very rushed and forced.  
I would reccomend this anime if you're just looking for a romantic anime, and not much else.  
But if you came to this anime because you heard it was a cool romantic story about classisism, family feuds, freedom fighting and an interesting, unique twist on a classic story you should maybe not waste your time on this.

    Romeo and Juliet the famous story of William Shakespeare about love, sex, tragedy and death received a lot of adaptations in the media through TV series and a live action film directed by Moulin Rouge director Baz Lutherman. Romeo X Juliet was heavily divided by many Shakespearian fans with other fans saying that it's a solid adaptation to it's source material and the other fans saying that it's bombastic and nonsensical to it's original story. To be honest, I really liked this series and sure there are some crucial changes to the original Shakespeare story, but somehow it manages to stay true to the spirit of the original story without being nonsensical. 
In the original story of Romeo and Juliet, it's was basically about two star crossed lovers in which their deaths unite their families, who are both rivals, but in the anime series of Romeo X Juliet is the exception of the plot: The members of House Capulet, including Juliet's parents, are murdered by Prince Leontes Montague and cut to years later in Neo Verona, Juliet is now sixteen and dresses herself as a boy with the name Odin and she is also known as ""The Red Whirlwind"" as she fights off Montagues forces to protect the innocent people that suffer through Leontes rule. During the annual Rose Ball, both Romeo and Juliet meet in the fountain and they fall in love very quick. As both Romeo and Juliet try to be together, Capulet royalists like Francisco and Curio are planning a rebellion against Leontes and in the couse of the series, Romeo and Juliet's love get stronger and a secret in Neo Verona is waiting to be revealed.  
Let's talk about the good things about Romeo X Juliet, cause, to be honest, there are tons of good things about the series. The animation by Gonzo is top-notch, with beautiful art and creative setting that stays close to the setting of the original story, but with fantasy elements mixed in (like the flying horses and the floating city of Neo Verona). The chemistry with Romeo and Juliet is great and while it does take a few moments for them to actually fall in love, it works and they share a pretty good chemistry like they fly on the horse together, they talk about their past lives, fight off a bunch of thugs together, they share food and even Romeo and Juliet make an oath on an abandoned sanctuary and that part did made me cry. The main villain Leontes Montegue is frightening, because deep down, the character has so much hatred and despair in his heart that you know why noblemen fear him in the first place. 
Juliet as a stronger and independent character is a welcome change, allowing the character to be more heroic and confident than the original story.. Side characters like Francisco, William De Franese, Curio, Cordelia, Conrad, and Antonio are fun to watch and they provide some decent moments that provide a nice change of tone. The music by Final Fantasy 12 composer Hitoshi Sakimoto is gorgeous. This is one of the most underrated soundtracks ever made and it a damn shame cause it really brings a sense of love, passion and tragedy that fits perfectly well to the series.  
The English dub in Romeo X Juliet by Funimation is perfect. It's better than the Japanese dub and it delivers top-notch Shakespearian dialogue and referencing some quotes in other Shakespeare plays like Hamlet and The Tempest. The cast did a great job with their performances with each giving character roles. Brina Palencia was perfect for the role as Juliet, capturing both the weak feminine and the strong willed side of the character, while Chris Burnett performance as Romeo is less impressive in the first half of the series but his performance improves later on in the second half of the series when things go chaotic.  Sean Hannigan's performance as the main villain Leontes is terrifying and every-time he speaks, it gives me chills through my spine. 
Now for the major flaws of Romeo X Juliet is that there's no rivalry between House Capulet and the Montague Nobles, cause they basically killed everyone from House Capulet and it's a shame too, since the family rivalry played a major role in the original Romeo and Juliet story and It also lead them to accept forgiveness and being united again cause of the tragic death of Romeo and Juliet. The side character villains are mediocre and there basically there to be evil bastards and side characters like Elizabeth and Emilia are completely forgettable and unneeded in the story. As for the ending of the series, I like it and felt like a nice closure to the series. However, if you're a fan of the original play, be aware that the ending of THIS adaptation is completely changed from the original and if you don't like that change, then you might be pissed at it. 
Romeo X Juliet is a great series that people can easily get into. Those who can accept the changes of the original play will find a series that adds new elements to make the story feel new again. If you're a fan of the original story then by all means, watch this series. It's a solid adaptation to the play and it's 10x better than the live action film Romeo + Juliet that came out in the 90's.

    Romeo X Juliet- Not to be confused with Romeo and Juliet, of course. It was a good anime... in its own way. However, if you are looking for the perfect anime adaptation, you will be sorely disappointed. The only striking similarity between the two is the names. Having said that, I did enjoy this anime. It was a touching love story. Here come the numbers- 
Story-6 (Fair) 
     Good, quite fast-paced in the beginning. Exciting, even. But then came the middle... it became so boring that I quit watching for a while, and valiantly returned some time later, to find that at the end the pace picked up again. But it some points it seemed very random. Not all ends were tied up. So it was decent, but nothing great. 
Art- 6 (Fair) 
     I personally liked the art. However, I am not an artist. My sister, who is, says that the art was painful to her.I thought that the animation style was inconsistent. But they had great backgrounds, like in the fields of flowers. So I gave it a 6. 
Sound- 8 (Very Good) 
     The opener was really great. I loved it. The rest of the music is... forgettable. But I loved the opener so much that I found it to be quite redeeming in the score for music. 
Character-5 (Mediocre) 
     Slightly cliche. The tragic heroine, the brave hero, the evil tyrant, etc., etc. But there were some good side characters whom I really liked. Side characters make a series, and I personally liked the side characters more than the main ones. The main characters were very weak. 
Enjoyment-7 (Good) 
     Yeah, I enjoyed it. It was my first romance anime. It was nice. Nothing great, though. 
Overall-7 (Good) 
     It was pretty good, actually. The end was confusing- they didn't tie up many of the ends. I was slightly disappointed with how loosely interpreted the storyline was from Shakespeare's version. But I did like it. 
So, in short, it was a decent anime. I liked it well enough. It was worth watching, but I wouldn't watch it again or buy it. A nice love story.

    When I went into this one, I really had no idea what to expect and what to receive. It's Shakespeare... as anime. 
This would either be the best thing ever, or the most painful. 
Story - to begin with, this isn't really Romeo and Juliet. The anime adds a lot of completely original elements, like (Neo-)Verona being a floating city in the sky, the existence of Dragonsteeds (which should be self-explanatory), people in oppression, a ""La Résistance""-esque group of vigilantes and most importantly changes the morality from grey-and-grey to black-and-white. And that's this anime's biggest flaw. Capulet and their allies are pure and good and Montague are pure evil and rotten to the core, with the exception of Romeo who is almost ridiculously kind. 
There are also the problem that every major character seems obligated to, at one point or another through the story, act like a complete and utter moron! It's impossible to count how many things could have been avoided if the characters just stopped to think once in a while. Sure, it's a way to get them from point A to point B, but there were much better and smarter ways of doing so. 
Art - the art and animation are mostly good, especially in the first half of the show before getting sloppier for a while, most likely saving itself for the finale. Character designs are nice, body proportions in particular, and the backgrounds and colors are very nice to look at. CGI do appear and while it isn't glaringly obvious it does look a little odd mixed with the traditional art. Drawbacks are thing's ""side-mouths"", which happen quite often, and walking animation, which can look a little stiff from time to time. 
Sound - simply brilliant. There are two ending themes, the first a rock-song and the other a ballad, both very good. The opening theme, a cover of ""You Raise me Up"" by Lena Park, is even better and is actually sung once in English in ep. 7. 
Characters - all major characters and even a few minor from the original play makes appearance and are aided by several original one's. The complexity varies but most of them are sadly simplified from their theatre-counterpart. Romeo and Juliet's ""feminine boy, masculine girl"" dynamic are exaggerated into making him shy and sweet and her a hot-blooded Action Girl. Tybalt is angry and brooding, Benvolio is nothing but Romeo's voice of reason and the most similar to his original characterization. And then there's Mercutio. 
Oh god. Mercutio. 
From being probably the most beloved - a charming, boisterous jokester - he's made into a smug snob with more connection to Montague than to Romeo. I found myself shutting my ears off whenever he appeared on screen. 
However the original characters, Conrad, Curio, Francisco, Cordelia (the ""nurse"") among others, I actually found myself enjoying. 
Overall, while there are some interesting aspects brought forth, in the end this anime fails as an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. As just another animated show, however? It's pretty damn good. 
Despite stupid decisions on the characters part, despite botching of beloved characters and despite the change from ""is anyone actually in the right?"" to a ""simple"" tale of good-vs-evil I still enjoyed myself thoroughly while watching. Every episode brought at least one laugh and the finale even some misty eyes. 
If you're a hard-core Shakespeare fan, you probably shouldn't watch this unless you're out to anger yourself. If, on the other hand, you're a bit more relaxed, don't care for the original to begin with or just want a new show to follow this is one definitely worth contemplating.

    By the title of this anime, Rome x Juliet, you already know that this is a story about two people that fall in love, but it's different. There's soo much more and a whole new thought in this storyline. There's a reason behind everything! 
The story was well written. It is a bit cheesy compared to Shakespears version. But I liked how there's more action and some fighting scenes. Also the fact that Romeo and Juliet are actually spending time together. It gives them an even more reason to want to be with each other. There's Romance, Tragedy, Drama, and Fantasy. 
The opening theme( You Raise Me Up- by Lena Park) was beautifully sung and really set the mood. I really enjoy this song :] The ending theme (Cyclone- by 12012) wasn't that bad either. 
Some of the characters might have been unnecessary, but in the end they played their part just fine. No one in this story stuck out more then the main characters, Romeo and Juliet. They did, however, help us understand the true warm-hearted  personalities of these two lovers. 
Overall I really enjoyed it. The entire story was well thought out, Love at First Sight, the Rose and Iris, Escalus, and the fact that it took place on a floating island. Like I said earlier, the story is somewhat like the original play. The falling in love and tragic fate, but the episodes aren't predictable. Each one has a shocking twist to it which is awesome because in the end it all ties together. Basically everything has a meaning to it. Definitely worth watching.

    Many people will detest this low score, but read me out before chewing me out. Romeo and Juliet was originally about two teenagers of two opposing houses who accidentally fell in lust (I don't believe in the lie of love at first sight) with each other. This story spans all of two weeks and shows just how hormonal we teenagers really are! 
The anime was barely different. 
Now sure, I'll be the first to admit that Romeo and Juliet was not my favorite Shakespeare play which makes me mildly bias, but I watched this because of the amazing reviews from friends. I was thoroughly disappointed. The story was changed and became an overused tissue of a plot. Boy meets girl (that he can't have) boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl make promise of staying together forever, boy, girl, or both, dies. (SPOILER:::::::: Well technically she turns into a tree and he's turned into a human shish kebab, which is ridiculous in itself.) 
Anyhow- this art was fabulous but was not enough to change my mind. As for sound- I see the pun within the main song ""Wind Beneath My Wings"", but they play it three or four plus times every friggin' episode, making me detest the song!! And I love that song...The characters- ooo, the characters. I actually really liked that they pulled names from Willy's other plays AND even had him as a character. He, Curio and the doctor (bless his soul)  were probably the only reasons I kept watching. 
All in all, if you're looking for an anime with a predictable plot, silly ending and broken record music (With great art and interesting side characters), then by all means, watch Romeo x Juliet.

    First of all- I haven't read Shakespeare's Romeo Juliet (Yes there are a few rare insects in this whole wide world who are too ignorant or lazy to do what I just said :P) So I would like to share some views based on only the anime version which I have watched. 
Story [10/10]: Even though this is a love story its also a story where both the protagonists have a purpose for their existence and their struggle to achieve their goal. The story evolves wonderfully. Love at first sight. Then a struggle to pursue that love no matter what. But the protagonists love their country as well as its people just as much is what really caught my attention to watch this anime. It sort of makes them the heroes of their masses. Continuity of the story is good. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to release the people of Neo verona from the clutches of the Dark King Montague who only desires power to rule all things in his grasp and beyond. Conflicts of strong emotions of love, compassion, anger, sadness are beautifully shown throughout the series. The way Neo Verona is uphead as a floating mass of land and its story is intriguing. I personally would have loved if the anime detailed some bits about how that floating continent came into being and the tree of life associated with it. Would have added a whole chunk of fantasy to the already plum plot of the series. The tragedy which follows in the end of the story just highlights the need for existence of both the protagonists and their struggles. 
Art [10/10]: The art of the series is definitely not mind-blowing but is very good nonetheless. Both the protagonists are nicely drawn. And their emotions rightly conveyed through the illustrations and animation together. Ruins inside the Neo Verona city or its outskirts have been aptly drawn, like the ruins of a church like structure in one of the episodes, or the where Romeo and Juliet meet on her birthday, etc. The castle exterior and interior are grand. Flowerbeds in the garden and forest landscaping is beautiful. 
Sound [10/10]: Hitoshi Sakamoto has done an excellent job on giving amazingly melodious Piano and Violin pieces. Deai, Kakki, Kimi no Iru Sekai are my favorites. The OP Inori- You raise me up is beautiful and the rocking ED cyclone. Voice actors of all characters have done a great job. 
Characters [10/10]: The tender hearts of both Romeo and Juliet have been brought out beautifully through their characters. I think the way the characters have been drawn also add to this. King Montague's past which has led him to become such a tyrant is very believable. His last words really add a lot in understanding his complex character in the end. Characters of all the colleagues of both protagonists are well built. 
Enjoyment [10/10]: It was a complete package really. It has bit of all things that attract a viewer to any anime romance, drama, action, adventure, fantasy. Never was a boring moment. 
Overall [10/10]: Full marks for a very entertaining show.

    This is my first review so please bear with me but I felt like there were some things about this anime that I had to discuss even though I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Story - 6 
I thought the story was a sweet, fresh take on Romeo and Juliet, adding some themes of magic and more of fairytale-like feel. The fact that it was hardly an adaptation at all of Romeo and Juliet is what really ruined the story. There were a lot of differences in Romeo x Juliet than the original with the setting being in Neo-Verona;  a floating island in the sky, creatures called dragonhorses which is literally a pegasus with a dragon tail, Juliet and a few loyal members being the last of the Capulets and not to mention a few other smaller changes. I was deeply disappointed in the balcony scene in the anime as it is one of the most famous scenes of the story of Romeo and Juliet and they screwed up the other most famous scene; the deaths of Romeo and Juliet too. I felt like they couldn't adapt any of the true parts of Shakespeare's work into the anime at all turning this into a story of it's own. I enjoyed the first 22 episodes but the last 2 episodes I felt went away from the story a bit and became too magical for my liking, they were unnecessary to the anime as a whole making me put it down a point. I sort of wish they stuck to the original idea of Romeo and Juliet's demise than the ending they did which felt like too much. 
Art - 7 
The art was nice, it was pretty and simple and I liked the continuous use of flowers. I did like the look of the ruins of buildings covered in flowers, the church being my favorite. The dragonhorses were beautiful also. The settings were nice and pretty but the character designs could have been better. 
Sound - 8 (Japanese subbed) 
The music was lovely, it matched the tone of Romeo x Juliet very well. The opening song (""You Raise Me Up"" in japanese) was enjoyable and I felt it was a perfect start of each episode. The voice actors were great but I felt like Juliet could have had a better voice actor, after all she has been through in the anime I think I would have liked her to have a stronger, more determined voice but that was alright. I don't have anything to say about the english dub voice actors because I generally find them to sound cheesy so i didn't bother with that. 
Characters - 6 
In the beginning I did take a liking to Juliet but her character started to annoy me as I felt like she became two different people; the strong, righteous character we are first introduced to and admire and then the pathetic Juliet whom continuously cries due to love. I know that is the true essence of the story; the heartbreaks and pain of loving someone whom you can not be with but it annoyed me in how weak she was when concerning Romeo. She also was clumsy at times doing stupid mistakes, when we had seen her doing magnificent acrobatic work and fighting as the 'Red Whirlwind' so that was a bit annoying. Romeo was alright, I didn't like him that much because he was so sensitive all the time and a little boring, he was a very typical princely love interest so I found him rather dull. I really didn't like how selfish Romeo and Juliet became in the last couple of episodes especially after being portrayed as selfless throughout most of the series, It annoyed me. I did get tired of Romeo and Juliet always uttering each other's names in a pathetic, whiny voice but maybe that's because I wasn't too enthusiastic with their love. The other characters were well done and some were developed nicely. We got to see the background of a few of them which was done well (except maybe Montague's background which wasn't really elaborated and was a bit far fetched), I wish we got to learn more about how Francisco and Curio came into service with the Capulets though. I also liked how Mercutio became in the end showing that there was more to him than I had thought and it made me pity him rather than hate. Putting William Shakespeare as a character was risky but they did a good job with him so I was pleased. The characters were realistic, as the anime went on I got a true feel of each character in the anime giving them their own individual identity. The only reason why I put a low score for the character's was due to the main two character's being quite frustrating. 
Enjoyment - 7 
Although I got tired of the romance between Romeo and Juliet, I did enjoy the anime a lot. There was some humour that made me laugh a couple of times and there was a good amount of tragedy   but also light heartedness. The fact that Romeo and Juliet were in love when they had hardly said anything to each other except each other's names and how hard it is to be together made me enjoy it less than I would have and  I felt like I was forcing myself to watch the scenes with the two of them together. I was hoping to hear Juliet yell ""O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo"" at some point but maybe that was hoping for too much considering how little they followed the actual story. By the end of the anime I felt happy and sweet although disappointed a little with the last two episodes. 
Overall - 7 
If it followed the original Romeo and Juliet at all I feel like this could've been much better although saying this I did like how original it was and the new direction it went in (which mostly away from anything of the original). Overall I give Romeo x Juliet a 7 which would have been higher if they had cut the last two episodes and had more development of the revolution ending it a more traditional sense of Romeo and Juliet, and Juliet and Romeo had more depth to their relationship. If you're looking for an anime that stays true to Shakespeare's work, I would definitely not recommend this but if you don't mind at how loose this adaptation of Romeo and Juliet is then I say you may as well give it a try!

    it is a very beautiful anime the story is incredible two guys who are in love with each other who can't love each other because of their families, but this anime taught me what love is, love is a feeling that drives you to do something for another person and I like this a lot and if love is impossible we have to win by force, I hope that this anime has changed many people, thank you who created this anime , and what can I talk about this wonderful soul that stole my heartand then the anime is not like William Shakespeare's initial comedy but this story is more beautiful because in the end the two do not poison themselves but die to save the world and stay forever with one another

    There are lot of ways to go wrong when you write an anime based on a famous work. Especially when that particular work is widely disliked by your target audience. Who wants to read a play about two young teens who kill themselves because they think the other is dead (practically right after they met)? It sounds silly. But Romeo X Juliet takes the brilliant parts of Shakespeare's play and turns them into a truly fantastic anime.  
For a plot that was (loosely) based off of a previously written work, this was done remarkably well. Each episode makes you eager for the next.  
Art: 10 
Not your conventional art for an anime, but once you get past the first few episodes, you get used to it. Some of the backgrounds are especially beautiful. 
Sound:9 
The music is very fitting to the atmosphere of the anime and adds much to it. The OP version of ""You Raise Me Up"" made me fall in love with the song. I also liked the ending songs. 
Character: 10 
The character development in this anime is phenomenal. Almost all of the major characters go through some sort of change, and I'm not just talking Romeo and Juliet. Even the more annoying characters get more likable. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It always keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you just have to see what happens next. The end of each episode is just too tempting. If you like a good romance (and a tearjerker) I would highly recommend watching Romeo X Juliet.

    Maybe it's because I'm a theatre buff, but this really doesn't tickle my fancy. They might as well have changed the character's names and not given any credit to Shakespeare- honestly that's as far as the similarities go.  Even if you haven't seen the play, or worked on it as I have, you'll know the basic outline of the play. Apparently those who created this didn't. Had this been an original anime I may have enjoyed it- perhaps watched the rest of the series, but simply because they killed a classic I can't bring myself to finish it. The animation and score are good, perhaps the only redeeming qualities there. 
In short, if you're expecting an anime mirroring the play, as I was, you'll be disappointed.

    It is sad when you see a good show underestimated. This is a good show underestimated. 
I wasn't very excited to watch a show about Romeo and Juliet because I'm not too much into romance and drama. The romance on this show was not the dominant hero. It went side by side with a much greater cause. 
First, as a person who studied English literature in college, this was a big treat. Imagine having a mash-up of Shakespeare's characters in one place. This is Romeo x Juliet. We even have Shakespeare himself. 
The creation of Neo Verona gave the story a new depth and flavor. The conflict is not about merely a teenage couple but it the struggle of a nation. The topic of the star-crossed lovers is accentuated. It does not follow the original plot per se so it leaves you wondering what will happen next. It is also fun to try and recognise which character if from which other play by Shakespeare. It is a choice of stereotypes. 
One more personal bonus for me was the first ending song. It's so beautiful and sad despite the upbeat music. It has a sense of nostalgia and something in it just tears my heart.

    RESEÑA EN ESPAÑOL (obviamente contiene spoilers) 
Romeo x Juliet es una de las tantísimas adaptaciones de la historia de amor trágica mas popular del mundo, y al igual que todas estas buscan mantener la línea de la historia original añadiendo elementos y giros de tuerca. 
En cuanto a la historia en sí tiene sus negros y blancos. Por un lado, que el odio a los Montesco por parte de los Capuleto responda al exterminio de su casa, la usurpación del trono y posterior difamación, sin contar la incansable persecusión a estos, es un añadido sumamente interesante; sobre todo en un punto que Shakespeare deja tan ambigüo en la obra original. El ver como Julieta es obligada a vivir con un álter ego, escondiendola incluso de sus propios aliados, junto con las escenas que nos muestran los arrestos a las sospechosas de ser descendientes de la casa Capuleto, nos dan no solo la primera impresión del peligro al que están expuestos, sino también de la situación política que vive Neo Verona. 
En lo negativo, lo primero a destacar es lo desinspirado del surgimiento del amor entre los protagonistas, respondiendo mas que nada a una suerte de ""enamoramiento a primera vista"" y no a un crecimiento gradual por parte de estos; haciendo que como espectadores no sintamos ningún tipo de cariño por la pareja, sobre todo si nos quitamos el preconcepto de que son ""Romeo y Julieta"". Continuando con el tema del romance, este no hace crecer a los personajes; porque sí, Romeo y Julieta maduran a lo largo de la historia, pero su relación no, al punto de que parece un amor mas basado en lo superficial y el ""gusto de lo prohibido"" que en un sentimiento genuino; sin mencionar lo egoísta y posesivo de ambos protaginstas, algo que hereda de la obra original. Otro elemento que quedó descolocado en la trama fue Escalus, añadiendo innecesariamente fantasía e irrealismo en una historia que hasta el momento, si bien tenía ligeros toques de magia, las situaciones era sumamente realistas, asimilables y plausibles; sin aportar nada realmente mas que una justificación para que la ""tragedia"" ocurriese. Para concluir, el final también fue decepcionante, no tuvo ni el 10% del impacto de la obra original y debido al contexto fantástico previamente establecido, parecía más ser el episodio final de un shonen de peleas que de una historia trágica/dramática. 
En materia personajes, la serie también es un gris: no decepcionan, pero tampoco destacan. Romeo y Julieta se sienten como un potencial desaprovechado, ya que si bien estamos frente al concepto de personajes que establecieron el arquetipo de ""los amantes prohibidos"", la adaptación con el nuevo contexto familiar de los Capuleto y la posición social elevada de los Montesco pudo haber permitido un ver alguna variación interesante en las personalidades de los protagonistas. Pero la serie optó por aferrarse al arquetipo y, si bien el Romeo y Julieta originales son muy buenos personajes, estos quedan reducidos a simples imitaciones, siendo incluso mas genéricos. El cast de secundarios estuvo bien dentro de todo: buen tiempo en pantalla, caracterización decente e identificación clara de sus afiliaciones; siendo quizá la excepción el Gran Duque Montesco, quién raya el papel de tirano unidemensional que gobierna con puño de hierro porque es malo y punto, además de tener un ""pasado trágico"" que lo hace ver como el oportunista mas afortunado de Neo Verona. 
El apartado técnico es bueno, sin destacar demasiado por ello. Los diseños no se apartan mucho de lo genérico, aunque destacan por ejemplo los ojos mas pequeños que la media del anime, dándole un toque mas ""europeo"" a la serie, lo que me pareció una excelente decisión. Tiene errores mínimos, como el color del cabello del Duque que era negro en su infacia, verde oscuro en su juventud y azul oscuro en su adultez, o cuando Benvolio detiene a Romeo en su pegaso y esos se mantienen flotando en el aire sin usar sus alas. La musicalización es lo mejor de la serie. 
En cuanto al entretenimiento, si bien este es el punto mas subjetivo, la serie se va haciendo progresivamente mas aburrida, sobre todo en su desenlace, irónicamente. 
En conclusión, Romeo x Juliet es una adaptación más de tantas que pasó sin pena ni gloria, pero que para los fans del género o de la obra original puede ser interesante y hasta de su agrado.

    This is my first time writing a review, although I have watched quite a lot of anime. 
I just could not leave this alone without writing something to describe my utter disappointment (or more precisely, anger) toward this series. The villains (the duke and his guard/carabineri) are just so terribly one-dimensional and evil, it just makes zero sense and causes me to get angry every time they say/do something. All of their actions are simply just pure evil for the sole purpose of being evil without any reason whatsoever. Case in point: when they go looking for Romeo, who has disappeared without reason, they learn he passed through some village. So what do the carabineri do? They take all of the villagers as prisoners, and start BURNING DOWN THEIR HOUSES - just because Romeo happened to pass though the village at some point before. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL? Throughout the whole show, the Duke and his guards/carabineri treat all other people in such a despicable and evil way, it just makes no sense to me ... these are supposed to be their subjects, they have committed no crimes, and suddenly the big masters come and start shitting on them for no logical reason whatsoever. 
This kept happening over and over in the show to the point where I could no longer tolerate it and just dropped it because it got way too ridiculous in the way of the villains being just plain evil and one-dimensional.

    ROMEO x JULIET. The name itself calls only one thing to mind: Shakespeare's most famous tragedy, the tale of the star-crossed lovers, Romeo & Juliet. However, if you want to see an anime adaptation, don't bother with this. After the first four minutes, you will see this has very little resemblance to Shakespeare  (in fact, one of the characters in the anime is named Willy Shakespeare).  
Story -- 6 
I hate hate hate how fangirls and fanboys are going crazy over this. This anime was heavily promoted at anime cons, online ads, previews, etc. However, when its name is literally ROMEO X JULIET, you expect...you know...some resemblance to the play, at all? Within the first few minutes, they basically show you the only thing in common is that the characters are named after the ones in the play, and that, yes, it is about two noble children that fall in love and are separated. But here's the issue: it's not separation by the families -- no -- its separation due to the fact that the boy's father gruesomely murdered every other member of the girl's family. Talk about a lot to overcome. 
The story is meh at best. It is creative, to say the least. It's set in an island floating in the sky, in a place called Neo-Verona (go figure) where it's basically  Italy in the 1600s, except with pegasi. However, this anime is SET UP to be a tragedy -- the problem being that, by the end of the anime, you actually are way too attached to the characters to let them die. In fact, because it doesn't follow Romeo & Juliet by Shakespeare at all, you have NO idea IF they die or not. And you become so attached to the main characters that you're praying that it basically bastardizes the original work of Shakespeare and allows them to live. (Spoiler: Don't worry, they still die.) 
In addition to this, the story skips around a bit and adds in random crap that isn't exactly necessary. Although it makes for more time to show off the awesome amazingness that is the soundtrack and art, the story itself takes a hit to allow that to happen. 
Art -- 9 
SHINYYYYYYYYYY. 
That basically sums up the art. It's high quality. Really, really high quality. Some of the highest quality anime art available with the current technology, I'd go as far as to say. It beats the crap out of any of the mainstream shojo or shonen anime art quality.  
Sound -- 10 
Warning: Rampant fanboyism ahead 
Oh my god. The one thing -- one thing -- that makes this anime remember-able, other than being very, very shiny, is two (well, rather, one) songs that form the soundtrack. I don't even remember the rest of the soundtrack -- but the cover of Secret Garden's ""You Raise Me Up"" by Lena Park is jawdropping. She even had it transposed for a Japanese song, entitled Inori You Raise Me Up, which also happens to be the opening theme for the series. It does not follow the lyrics of You Raise Me Up at all, but flows very nicely and serenely -- if you had not known it were based off of the tune of You Raise Me Up, you would still love it. Between the sappy romance and the utter gore of Romeo X Juliet, hearing about star-crossed lovers and how one shall always support another in such an inspiring song in both English and Japanese says something. This has to be one of the best, if not the best, soundtracks of any anime. Ever. 
Character -- 6 
Fair would be, well, fair to describe what the characters are. They are loosely based off their namesakes in Shakespeare's play. There is only one very well done performance in the anime. The performance of Juliet, when she decides to be a rebel and crusade as the Red Zorro...er, rather, the Red Whirlwind* shows a compassionate level of caring not found in most characters, giving Juliet both a strength and a weakness to her character. The other characters are basically static throughout, but show enough emotion to give this a ""fair"" review. They act believable, which is enough for me. 
*No. Really. She is basically Zorro, but with a red hat. Don't believe me? Google it. 
Enjoyment -- 6 
Enjoyment during ""You Raise Me Up""  -- 9 
Otherwise -- 5.8 
Evens out to a 6. Ish. Honestly, the anime is ""cute"" to say the least, and is entertaining. The enjoyment value again varies on your taste; if you're looking for a refined anime, keep looking. Try Cowboy Bebop. But if you're looking for a very well made, artistically at least, anime with an amazing soundtrack, you will enjoy the anime very much. The characters are meh, as is the plot, but for me, the art and soundtrack make it a worthwhile investment to see. 
The 7 represents the culmination of an average or below average anime which has an amazing budget, aka, making it very very shiny with an awesome soundtrack. It would normally get a 5 or 6 -- not rememberable -- but due to its high budget, hype, well made art, and beautiful soundtrack, it is bumped up to a 7. If you really just want to experience the anime in its fullest, however, just watch episode seven. It has all the music and art in one package.

    This was a struggle for me to plow through and definitely among one of Gonzo's weaker efforts. Romeo x Juliet attempts to go for a more fantasy-based approach to Shakespeare's tragic love story of feuding families and teens in love. Instead though, this series takes far too many liberties with the source material where it completely alters the basic concepts of the original play's storytelling. Rather than the Capulets and Montagues having a rivalry with one another and both sides shown to be in the wrong for their conflict, Romeo x Juliet depicts a black-and-white storyline with the Capulets being the ""good"" side and the Montagues being the ""bad"" side (done enough times), with the former being mostly killed off and the latter ruling the kingdom of Neo Verona with an iron fist. Whatever remnants there are of the Capulet family are leading a resistance movement against the Montagues' tyranny (name enough anime titles that pull this off) with Juliet unwillingly being the leader of said movement, especially as she comes to gain a love interest in Montague family heir Romeo. 
My snarking in the parenthesis of the previous paragraph should clue you in what makes this take on Shakespeare's classic a major issue for me. It relies so heavily on cliches for its plot and character developments, that it's laughable. Romeo's the idealistic and courageous young boy, Lord Montague the merciless and power-hungry ruler, Tybalt the revenge-seeking loner, Mercutio the opportunistic power-snagger, and so forth. Basically, mostly everyone in the series is tacked on with an archetype and they don't really develop very much out of it. In addition, the characters tend to make very illogical decisions in many instances that the series tries playing up as dramatic yet come across more ridiculous, especially in the finale of the series. Only character I really found myself caring for was ""Willy"", whose foppish and flamboyant take on William Shakespeare provided some humor and sanity for me in this mess of a series. 
Visuals were decent for the most part with vivid color and a good amount of visual detail applied for scenery and character designs. Action scenes were somewhat engaging with the implementation of Dragon Steeds used for travel and engaging into battles, though animation wasn't a major element in their use since many such scenes were flourishes and weren't relying on regular animation shortcuts. The dramatic musical score for the series is nice to listen to featuring orchestral pieces and a nice ballad from Korean singer Lena Park for an OP and insert song, though are quite overwhelming in their implementation at points during key scenes in the series. 
Overall, I found Romeo x Juliet to be quite underwhelming. The anime tries being dramatic in its take on Shakespeare's tragic work, but takes too many liberties with its source material and dabbles into too many cliches to be a unique work compared to Gonzo's earlier effort with Gankutsuou. Definitely don't waste any time with this one.

      Have you ever seen Romeo and Juliet? It’s a really popular play written by William Shakespeare. Countless variations of the play have been adapted in different mediums. Movie, book, TV Series, Anime. You name it, they have it. It’s considered by many as probably the best romance story in all of literature. But does it live up to the hype? Is it really THAT good? Is it worth watching when I already know what will happen in the end? If this is a Q&A, I would’ve easily answered that, but this is a review so just find out as you read along. Romeo x Juliet: a tragic tale of love and revenge. Is it truly love that can never be? 
  Romeo x Juliet like its origin, Romeo and Juliet is a true masterpiece. Not only that it tells the beautiful story of love and revenge, but there’s also a fantasy twist which will just make things much more interesting. Having seen Romeo and Juliet plays for about three times now, I always felt that there is something missing. The original story feels somewhat 1D in comparison to the “remake” though I will never say that one is better than the other. They’re both good in their own ways but it feels like adding something new to the story makes it standout even more. I don’t know. Maybe I was just tired of seeing the same old story over and over again so when a bit of a fantasy element was added, I enjoyed it a lot better. The title in it of itself is enough reason for you to watch this show. 
  Though the series mainly focuses on Romeo and Juliet, it is not right to say that the supporting cast is not that good. You’ll either hate them (Lady Hermoine and King Montague) or love them (William Shakespeare appears in his own creation. lol.) but they are made for you to do so. You’ll hate a character because they were made to be hated. It like professional wrestling: Heels (Chris Jericho is the natural heel in my book) are made to be hated while Faces (Super John Cena) are made to be cheered for. Now, with the supporting cast out of the way, let’s talk about the 2 characters that gave the series its name: Romeo and Juliet. 
  At first, we have Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet (No google. Fuck yes!) who is not your typical damsel in distress. Throughout the series, Juliet is always fighting. Not just for herself, but for everything as well. As Odin, her “superhero” alter ego, she fights the system for the right of every citizen of Neo Verona. While as Juliet, the rightful heir to the throne of de Capulete, she fights not only for her right for the throne, but for her love as well. In the course of 24 episodes, Romeo and Juliet had too little screen time together because they we’re always apart. This in turn made Juliet a little weaker but not helpless. She is a fighter down to her core. Shows a feminine side often but produces testosterone higher than even Simon, the personification of testosterone (in my book) himself. Okay, that’s enough. lol. What I’m trying to say is that, she may be a damsel in distress but she is definitely not that helpless. She’s just madly in love with Mr. Perfect, Curt Hennig, I mean Romeo. 
  Then, we have Romeo Candorebanto Montague (I googled that! Fuck yes!), a noble gentleman (Like yours truly) who died a virgin (Like you. Haha, burn! Just kidding! lol. )… Or did he? I think. Probably. Lesson? Be a gentleman but never abandon your perverted side. Be like me, I mean like Sanji. He’s a good example. lol. Anyway, back on topic. He, like me (*grins*), treats women really good (right Hermoine? *winks*) and does anything for the one he loves (aka. Andres de Saya. It’s an expression in my country. Send me a PM or comment if you want to know what that means. lol.). The personification of chivalry and that’s about it. I have nothing much to say about his character other than that. He’s not a bad character but I didn’t give a shit about him that much. He’s just a bit perfect for my taste. I sometimes imagine him walking and the words noble, gentleman, handsome, and perfect will simultaneously pop on top of his head. You know, like that one in Seitokai Yakuindomo (Fun show. Go watch it.). lol. I’m getting a little sexist but that’s fine, right? I’m a man after all so I think it’s natural that I care about Juliet more than him. In all seriousness though, I feel like he’s a male nadeshiko, perfect, just too perfect for my taste. 
  Romeo x Juliet was animated by Gonzo back in 2007. But if you’re familiar with Gonzo, you know that they are a bit hit and miss. Though they can make amazing stuffs like Full Metal Panic, they can also do things like Gantz. It’s as if they flip a coin and be like: “If its head then let’s put all our effort in it, but if its tails then let’s just fuck it”. Well, going back on topic. In Romeo x Juliet’s case, I think it’s safe to say that the coin landed on its head. The animation is nothing too fancy but definitely still worthy of praise. I don’t remember seeing any CG which is like Gonzo’s trademark. I just might not have noticed it but I’m pretty sure they didn’t wave their 3D cocks in this series. Not much bombastic scene other than the few battle scenes and the “thing” in the end so the animation was a little stale but I think it’s not enough to deter future viewers. Overall, the animation is pretty polished for a Gonzo show. 
  If I can marry a voice actress, it would probably be Brina Palencia. She’s got the looks, the voice, and the wits (Go check out her con-session videos with J. Michael Tatum on Youtube, it’s really cute). So when I heard her dub for Juliet, I was seriously fangasming. Just like how Crispin Freeman is the embodiment of Alucard, Brina is the only one meant to play as Juliet. She nailed both her damsel in distress persona as well as her Odin alter ego. In regard to Chris Burnett who played Romeo, it’s a real good dub; however, I think there are other ones who are much more suited for the job. I can’t really think of a name, but I just felt that his dub was not as powerful as Brina’s. And because I have only seen the dub, I don’t really have anything to say about the sub. I’ve never seen the Japo dub line up as well, so I can’t predict if it’s a good dub on their part. So, if you plan on watching it for the first time, it’s only obvious that I suggest that you watch it dubbed. It’s a Funimation dub so it’s really good. 
  The soundtrack is really good too, specially the different variations of the original “You Raise Me Up” by Josh Groban. Though repetitive, I wouldn’t say I was unhappy about it because it was always used at the right moment. One perfect time when it was used was at episode 7. Oh my god, I swear to God (even if I’m an atheist), my testosterone level have never been so low my entire life. I was about to squeal but I was watching it with my friends so I had to hold back a little. Anyway, yeah, at that time when a certain event happened at episode 7, the way they used You Raise Me Up was just godly. To this day, every time I watch it, I still get goosebumps. All I can say is, well done. There’s also this instrumental version of the song (I really suck at identifying sounds. It might be a guitar or a piano or neither) and when I hear that, I naturally sing along with it. 
Verdict: 
  If there’s one “flaw” in this series, I would say it was its ending. Though technically not a flaw, I feel like as a human being, you have already been spoiled even before you  watch this show (If you don’t know how Romeo and Juliet ends then you, my friend, have been living under a rock your whole life. And since I’m a bit generous today, here’s a gift: Romeo and Juliet both die in the end. You’re welcome). Though the means differ in both mediums, the tragedy is still present and may deter some people because they know what will happen. No offense to those who have that mindset, but I personally thinks that’s a stupid reason for not even touching the show. Romeo and Juliet is a true masterpiece in any medium and we should all watch it at least once in our lifetime. Do not be deterred by the spoiler, even if they both die, their trials and hardships are what make the story incredible. “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey”. 
  With all that said, after some random computations, I’d gladly give Romeo x Juliet an overall score of 9.06 out of 10. As a true masterpiece made by the one and only William Shakespeare, no human being have the acceptable excuse to not watch it. It is a beautiful story of love and revenge that I’m sure 95% of viewers will really like. The other 5% probably have poor taste or just men with really high testosterone level. If you have not seen it yet, you have my full pledged recommendation in doing so. If my reviews have somehow helped you in the past then this one will surely end up to your liking as well. 
Alternate Anime Recommendation: 
  For alternate anime recommendation, why don’t you try Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo? Both series centers around love and revenge that somewhat led to a tragic end. Though do not be deterred as both series have an outstanding journey in between them. And funny enough, both series was made by Gonzo back in the day and both of them are adaptations from really popular stories; Romeo and Juliet for Romeo x Juliet and The Count of Monte Cristo for Gankutsuou. 
  If you don’t like classic literature that much then we have… hmmm… *checks list* Ah! Got one! Nisekoi! I know what you’re thinking: “WHAT A SHITTY RECOMMENDATION FOR ROME X JULIET!” I know! I should probably punch myself. Though in defense, let me give some obvious comparisons. Both series have family feuds, romance (hahahaha!), and tragedy (because Nisekoi is a harem! Hahahahaha!). Though be warned that even if both series are somewhat comparable, they could never be much more different. I just couldn’t find another anime in my list that had the same premise so, yeah, fuck me! Hahaha! 
  And that’s it for me! Thanks for reading! Bye!

    Many people would say, ""Romeo and Juliet? Seriously?"" But yes, believe it (no I'm trying to be Naruto). I have to admit I was skeptical when I first saw it but I finally decided to watch a few months later after seeing the trailer (which is seriously epic. Probably the best trailer for anything I've ever seen). That, was an excellent decision. 
STORY: 
Not the well known Shakespeare story. No useless battles, idiotic butlers and no hormonal teenagers (Well, actually, no. They're the main characters. But they're a lot less hormonal.) If you didn't take the time to read the summary above, I suggest you do. Both happy and sad (Yeah, I cried), the story really is great. Rating: 9/10 
ART:  
The art is actually pretty good. Neo Verona is beautiful (I kinda want to move there) and the people are all animated quite well. If you're a fan of Gonzo's other work, you'll like this one. Rating: 9/10 
SOUND:  
The music isn't a masterpiece but it does just fine. The real ""WOW!"" comes from the voices. This is one of those rare occasions I actually like the English dub cast better than the original Japanese. Juliet is played amazingly by Brina Palencia (Hell Girl, One Piece, Evaneglion) and Romeo is played by the not very well known Chris Burnett (Bamboo Blade, Big Windup!, Itsudatte My Santa!) This was the first role I ever heard him in and I absolutely fell in love with his voice. It's amazing. The supporting roles are also played well. William (J. Micheal Tatum) and Benvolio (Sean Micheal Teague) are played perfectly. Also, the script was really good. They could be a little more creative than the Japanese version with fitting in Shakespeare quotes. Rating: 9/10 
CHARACTER: 
I really like the characters, especially Juliet. She's really strong and independent without coming off as a tsundere character. Romeo is equally good, being sensitive and naive but strong at the same time. The supporting characters are also really great and add a lot to the story. (I absolutely love the little Curio x Francisco x Juliet backstory!) Rating: 10/10 
OVERALL: 
A really enjoyable series, especially for Shakespeare and history fans. But overall, an AMAZING show! Overall Rating: 10/10

    Ah, Romeo and Juliet. Probably the most enduring love story of all time. The story of passionate young star crossed lovers, in passionate searing love, falling into the hands of an impossibly tragic fate in order to teach their quarreling families and the audience a lesson about innocence in the midst of violence and hatred. Lovely and stirring and compelling, right? I sure think so. So being the really really pathetic Shakespeare nerd that I am....and a huge fan of anime I thought to myself, ""ROMEO AND JULIET IN AN ANIME????"" *nerdgasm* ""I MUST SEE THIS"". 
but 
after seeing it, all I could think was ""poo."" 
STORY 
This anime, despite it's lovely name and main characters named after the protagonists of Shakespeare's masterpiece, is absolutely NOT the classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" that I was expecting....and wished that the anime delivered. Don't get me wrong. The fact that they changed the story...or wrote an entirely different story stickered with the name of Romeo X Juliet...though unexpected, did not soil my opinion of the anime. In fact, the main premise of the story was very compelling and some aspects of it were good. Very good in fact. BUT OH. the tragedy of this take on Romeo and Juliet was not in the story. It was in the writing. So much potential to be a good series! So many ways that the story could have succeeded! Oh how I flinched while I watched this series as each and every good thing this series had going for it turned to dust with each completely unnecessary arc to enter into the story. Simplicity is beautiful. I wish the writers knew this. So instead of witnessing the achingly pure innocent love story that is at the very heart of Romeo and Juliet...and this series...the love story aspect gets bogged down and diminished by all of the extra unneeded overly angsty arcs that begin to clutter up the last 1/3 of the series. I'm not saying that this series was not a ""romance"" series. It was very ""romantic"". It had all the cheesy lines and the cutesy couple scenes. But that isn't what Romeo and Juliet is all about! IT'S ABOUT PASSION. But the romance in this series was...bland.  Romeo and Juliet, oh Romeo and Juliet where for art thou romantic beautiful version of Romeo and Juliet?? *cries*  
I actually enjoyed the artistic aspect of this series quite a bit. Yes, the animation was not top-notch. at all. But the soft tones and muted pastelly well detailed backgrounds really were pretty. They almost made me feel as if I were watching a fairy tale. The character designs were nice too. I really loved the innocent boyishness of Romeo's appearance and Juliet was not the fickle little thing that she normally gets portrayed as. Overall, the art was not the most disappointing part of the series. 
The music for this series is lovely. It's frilly and fantastical and it matches the tone of the series perfectly. Not perfect, but nice. I really love the song ""you raise me up"" which the series adapted as its themesong. SO ROMANTIC. too bad it was probably the most romantic part of the series. 
Thank goodness the characters in the series were awesome. Otherwise my score for it would've ended up a lot lower. But the characters really make this series. I loved that Juliet was not portrayed as a weak fickle damsel. Not only is she super strong and courageous, she's a freaking super hero! That rocks. I also liked how Romeo was portrayed. He wasn't the little hormonal whiny sop that he normally is portrayed as...instead, he's level headed and rational and strong. I dig that. The supporting characters, although MUCH less developed, were likable and enjoyable to watch as well. Each one plays a role in the story and makes the viewer have a deeper interest in what was going in the series. Even if the story was not perfect, the characters carried it quite well. 
Enjoyment/Overall 
Was this series Romeo and Juliet, the masterpiece, the tragic tale of passion and love?? Definitely not. But this series was not terrible either. It was, for the most part intriguing and enjoyable. As long as you don't mind A LOT of revisions to the original story and messy somewhat disappointing writing, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy it.

    Okay, lets start off with saying that everyone knows Shakespeare' s Romeo and Juliet. It's a well established play and movies have followed (with one coming soon). So when I came in to watch this anime I thought I knew what I was going into. The same old same old, right? 
Wrong.  
Romeo x Juliet tell the tale of two lovers named Romeo and Juliet but that's as far as the relevance to the play goes. In this version there's pegasi, evil Dukes, magic trees, long lost relatives and a rebel fighter. Sounds appetizing right? Wrong again. Romeo x Juliet has been one of the most boring and agonizing anime adventures I have had. 
Story 7/10 - I have to say that Gonzo were creative with changing the story to a well known topic. They did it in such a way where even though you think you know the outcome, you second guess yourself and then third guess. I was surprised with the plot during most of the anime. Though, at times I was let down by the randomness and the loose wires left laying around. Sometimes I found myself thinking that some scenes were unnecessary to the plot. 
Art 6/10 - I wasn't a big fan of the character art but the scenery was spectacular. The buildings really were drawn in the style of Italy in the Middle Ages. The flowers were also well drawn and easily distinguishable. There isn't really much to talk about the art, it was good. 
Sound 8/10 - The best aspect of the anime by far. The OP (which is a Japanese version of You Raise Me Up) sounded so beautiful and I always looked forward to listening to it. The ED during the first half was also really good, it was more of an upbeat song which suited the anime. The ED during the second half wasn't as good but it suited the more serious phase the anime was entering. The background music was always well timed and set the mood. 
Characters 3/10 - BOOM and the anime just explodes at this point. The characters were terrible. If this was based off Shakespeare' s Romeo and Juliet, couldn't some characters at least remained the same? My favourite character, Mercutio, was crumbled and desrroyed. That aside, lets say for originality purposes. Then there's the way characters were made to seem unnecessarily evil. They had evil cackles, the eyes, the terrible lines and altogether seemed over the top and unnatural. Duke Montague was portrayed awfully and so was the Friar. Many characters from the play didn't even make an appearance, for originality again maybe? And don't even get me started on Romeo and Juliet. Romeo seemed so emotionless at so many scenes and too emotional at some. He was shown as an ignorant child (which I guess he was so they did something right). Juliet as the Red Whirlwind was one of the most kickass characters but as soon as she took off that mask, she became an underdeveloped and wimp-like character. The only decent characters which stopped me from giving this section a 0 was Tybalt (and his muscly arms), Antonio, Francisco and a bit of Benvolio. 
Overall,  I give this anime a 5/10. Through the first half of the anime I found myself completely dull with no emotions towards the anime. As the anime continued, I found myself wanting to hurry up and finish it so I could write this review. It wasn't a waste of time because I now appreciate Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet a lot more. The occasional quotes from the play were a treat and I do admit some scenes were cute. Yet, I wouldn't recommed this to many but if you wouldn't mind having the flower power 'peace man' quota being thrown around, go ahead and give this a shot. I definitely don't want to be rewatching this.

    I was recommended RomeoxJuliet as ""something to poke fun at."" For the first three episodes, I felt pained by how bad it felt and really did just poke fun at it. But when I went back to it, I realized that it was ""funny"" in and only in that it was how I was expecting it. Also, the script in the first few episodes is a bit jolty in its wording from modern to archaic and back. That levels out pretty soon, and is very smooth and beautiful. Sub and Dub are both done quite well, and I do believe that Chris Burnett as Romeo did the least cheesy ""No!"" I have ever heard.  
Story-wise, it is solid. There were a couple of plotholes here and there like just about any story, but for the most part it flowed quite well. Escalus is brought in smoothly, even though it's kind of like ""okay. tree. your point?"" at first. But it is incorporated well, even though it doesn't come in until halfway through the series.  
My only complaints are the Red Whirlwind and the color-coding. I know that color-coding is common in anime, but RomeoxJuliet seemed to take it to an extreme that it became a plothole. I get the hair matching the coat-of-arms, but the clothing, the cloaks, the swords, the eyes? It got a smidgen ridiculous. As for the Red Whirlwind, how come no one could guess it was Juliet? No one else would wear that much pink. And the fact that the Red Whirlwind looks like a pink Zorro did not help in taking-this-seriously factor. 
Character, wow, where to begin. It would be easier to list who I didn't like, because that list is so much smaller. All the characters had depth. Romeo, Juliet, Francisco, Curio, Tybalt, even Benvolio had a level of depth in his quirks and maturing. Romeo and Juliet's love and attraction grows quite beautifully and smoothly.  
Overall, I enjoyed this quite a bit. If you want a beautiful, well-done, sappy story, I'd suggest trying RomeoxJuliet. Also, it does not have a violence and profanity level worth of the R rating MAL gives it. While a bit of gore and violence is defintiely present, there is nothing being severed, and most blood is all post-act.

    As an English Major in University, I would be the first to say that Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is far from the masterpiece many think it is.  
The original play is rushed, unbelievable and ultimately the characters themselves are most at fault. Romeo and Juliet are nothing more than lovestruck teenagers, who cannot stop thinking about their libido long enough for the play not to end in tragedy. That being said, Romeo x Juliet is an inventive interpretation of one of the worlds most famously known plays.  
The story of Romeo x Juliet, is thankfully, a pretty big departure from the original. Adding in a flair of fantasy while keeping the true essence of what Shakespeare was supposedly trying to achieve in telling a tragic love story. What falls flat ultimately though is the pacing of the story and parts of its presentation. The introduction of Escalus and Juliet's true destiny should have been introduced much sooner, as well as a lot of the development that worked to make the love between them more realistic broke the pace of what could have been a true masterpiece. 6/10 
I quite liked the art of this adaption, the contrasting images of Montague Blue and Capulet Red was nice along with the bright colours and flowers that populated Neo Verona. 8/10 
When I first heard the intro song I was off put by how familiar it was. It wasn't long until I realized it was a cover of You Raise Me Up,  and while at first I wasn't too fond of it, I'm not too fond with most versions of it to be fair, it grew on me and ultimately fit well with the story. 10/10 
The characters of Shakespeare's play are ultimately its downfall. Romeo and Juliet are basically moronic teenagers who get themselves killed, while it may be romantic, the pacing would show that it was nothing more than momentary lust and you lose a lot of the sense of tragedy or romance that would normally be perceived. Romeo x Juliet does a lot to alleviate this, however it still falls short. Romeo is honestly a bore and Juliet is the clichéd mold of a anime heroine, but both are huge steps in the right direction in comparison to Shakespeare's version. The twists that were added to such characters like Tybalt and Mercutio were wonderful delights and if only all were utilized in such a fashion this could have been so much more. 7/10 
Like I stated before I am an English Major in University, so coming across Shakespeare's work is pretty much unavoidable. I've never been much of a fan, but do enjoy some of his plays, unfortunately Romeo and Juliet is not one of them. After having to recently right an essay on it, I remembered this adaptation and low and behold, honestly and truly loved it. 10/10 
Except for a few misteps, this is definitely an anime worth watching. If you know the original at all, it is almost a crime not to watch this just to see it in a different light. I give this anime 8/10.

    ***This is a Spoiler-Free Review*** 
Alright, for better or worse, shelve what you know about Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, this anime is a fantasy-action and romance story loosely *inspired* by the timeless play, not quite an adaptation.  If that doesn't sound appealing or you were expecting Romeo & Juliet: the Noh Drama / [High School] Musical, you may leave.  The rest of you...have a seat. 
Story [6/10] - It should go without spoiling anything that the focus of the story is our hero Romeo and our heroine Juliet falling in love and the events that transpire before and as a result of this.  Towards the beginning of the anime, the creative liberties taken and new characters introduced are refreshing, exciting, and it's great to see the lens focused with Juliet as the main character.  The fantasy-like setting is fun.  It starts out having a great mix of the romance, gripping backstory, action, and character development.  Some shows use that momentum and ultimately finish out strong...but Romeo X Juliet sadly is not one of them.  Had the second half been as good as the first half this score would be much higher.  But if you appreciate good plot with an equally strong resolution rather than anime cliches, you like me will have an imprint of your face on your palm by the end. 
Art & Animation [5/10] - Oh boy.  At TIMES the art an animation quality are outstanding.  R x J is sometimes here, sometimes there.  Sometimes there are beautiful backgrounds with well drawn characters (the very beginning and very end are good examples), and at other times characters proportions, ESPECIALLY faces get completely screwed up the moment the character simply turns their head to face a different direction.  In one episode, I thought to myself ""they must have spent all the money for this episode on animating Juliet in that scene, because in this next scene Francisco's nose isn't on right..."" I always try to look at animation in perspective of when it was made, and at times R x J has the animation production value of a show made in 2001.  Gonzo and GK are both at fault here, because Gonzo is guilty of this in the past, and we all know they could have been better than that comparing to some of their other titles (even ""moeblob"" titles). 
Sound (OST, OP/ED, Acting) [9/10] -  
The OST is the true gem of this title.  Whether or not you ever watch this show, you owe it to yourself to listen to if not OWN this soundtrack.  Sakimoto-sensei is a man of exceptional talent, compared often to Uematsu Nobuo even though their styles are pretty different (probably by association to Final Fantasy, as his other famous work is the OST to FFXII).  The often fully-orchestrated tracks bring an unbelievable amount of live into the characters, at times almost TOO much.  But in this case, can't have too much of a good thing. 
The OP is also fabulous, naturally pretty much a cover of ""You Raise Me Up"", but Korean-born Lena Park sings it with vigor and when she hits the high notes, the timbre and beauty of her voice really shine.  Excellent staffing choice there.  The EDs are enjoyable enough to listen to, the 2nd more than the 1st, but are overall pretty forgetable. 
Lastly, the voice acting.  Well I'll just say... Gonzo sure as heck saved money in this department.  They probably spent most of their budget on Sakimoto-sensei.  The female seiyuu are composed of a lot of unknown talents, and some of the best seiyuu in the production (Iwao Junko, Saito Chiwa) play very minor roles.  The male seiyuu do a little better save for one gripe.  Those who pay attention to the ""acting"" part of voice acting may agree with me, but it takes true grit to put up with Romeo's voice for 24 episodes (let alone Mizushima-san's voice in general but that is an opinionated digression not suited for this review).  That aside the award for best role in the show goes to Ishii Kouji for his roles as Montague.  Truly brings out, and makes you hate, the character which brings me to my next section... 
Character [6/10] - At the beginning of the show, this really is around an 8 or a 9.  The anime-original characters are very welcome, and whether or not you agree with the roles chosen for some similarly named characters from the play, the backstory of characters such as Tybalt are well written.  Montague especially seems to be the perfect villain in the beginning, and continues to be through the later half.  However...all semblance of character development seems to crumble in the last few episodes.  You feel as if you are watching one of Willy's plays, because if you, even based on the anime alone, sit and think ""what would the characters I have come to learn so much about over these past 20 episodes do in this kind of situation?"" you'd be surprised at how contrary their actions seem, as if they are puppets in a play...or victims of poor writing on the staff's part.  Some characters are completely forgotten, whilst others are simply assigned stereotypical ""roles"" which completely overwrite their personalities. 
Enjoyment [7/10] - On the whole a fairly enjoyable title.  The ups generally outweigh the downs and if you're looking for fantasy-romance, you can do worse than R x J.  Some of the well written parts make the show worth seeing on the whole, and the incorporation of the OST as well as some of the ""new"" or ""refreshed"" characters give this title life differentiated from the Shakespeare play. 
Overall (not an average) [7/10] - Based on the ANN Rating System ""Good, worth seeing"" Naturally there are negatives, the art and animation being the primary factor, and the somewhat rushed writing towards the end of the anime. But on the positive, the refreshed setting, new characters, and most of the character development make it worth the ride and some scenes may even be worth a rewatch.  Like a good coaster, you will enjoy most of the ride, you just might get gas pains afterwards from that chili you ate before. 
Rewatch Value: Low

    SOUND/SONG/OP AND ED SONG... 
The OP song of this anime is very suitable for the theme of the love story of Romeo and Juliet. I don't think any other music would perfectly fit this very emotional and somehow classic anime. 
However, the ED song for the first half of the anime is a rock/loud music, contrasting to its OP song, and it's not that suitable. However, I cannot totally judge this song because I never tried to listen to it completely. The second ED song is, i think, more suitable, because it has a nice melody, and the meaning of the song fits the story. 
ART/ANIMATION: 
The flying horses there are not consistent in terms of art and animation. However, the art/animation is not that bad and the characters were drawn well, and the conservativeness of the story is seen in the art of the characters. 
I haven't read Romeo and Juliet, so this review is not that dependable to those who read it. But the way the story was put in the anime is very nice because even my little sister, who doesn't love serious romance animes, watched it and was very touched and very affected by it. The end is unpredictable, but because this story is famous for its tragic end, you would really want it to end the other way. You would want to have something, a sort of a miracle, to twist its story, because you feel you're a part of it, you feel like you're going to be greatly affected if it would end tragically, if it would end the original way. 
Every end of an episode keeps you hanging and asking for more. However, on the 22nd/23rd episode, you would want to end it there. 
The original story is translated in a nice way, because I understood the gist of the story. 
CHARACTERS: 
I liked the the way they retained the names of the characters. 
As of their roles, I found Juliet strong, but becomes weak when it comes to love, and is very indecisive when her love for Romeo will be greatly affected with her decision. 
Romeo is the perfect guy a girl can have, as presented in this anime. 
The antagonists are effective antagonists because they can make you angry and pity the protagonists. 
About the supporting characters, I think they supported the main characters well. 
CONCLUSION/OVERALL: 
This is a very nice and classic romance anime, and it will keep you asking for more of it. You know, I didn't plan on writing a review for this, but after I finished watching it, I was greatly affected, even though 2 days passed by already. It's still fresh on my mind... 
You must watch this anime if you want simple and sweet romance love stories, without the Ecchiness, and with just pure feelings... ^_^

     I figured that I should write my first review with one of my favorite stories I've ever seen/read. Romeo x Juliet is one of the most romantic and tragic anime ever because it's derived from Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet, duh. But the anime's story is a little bit different than Shakespeare's, with the addition of mythical creatures and magic to add even more drama into an already dramatic story.  
Story: The love story between Romeo Candorebanto Montague and Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet. But instead of their parents being enemies and forbidding their love, the Montague family killed the entire Capulet family, except for Juliet who grows up to be the people's hero of justice, ""Red Whirlwind"". Meanwhile, the Montague family is a tyranny, and cruel to the people, therefore making them Juliet's opponent. And in the midst of a rebellion, Romeo and Juliet's destinies cross, and the all so romantic and tragic love story between Romeo and Juliet begins. I loved the anime version as much as I did the original play, and I LOVED the original play! There were moments... No, the entire anime was tugging at my feelings, there were many scenes where I couldn't help but cry soo much!! 
Art: The art was the same as your typical anime made around 2007, not clear and beautiful, but a more realistic looking art. The characters were designed just the way I had imagined them when I read Romeo and Juliet. I loved the quiet symbolism of poison, roses and beautiful angelic wings.  
Sound: This was amazing! Romeo and Juliet had the perfect voice cast for them! The music certainly made all the sad moments in Romeo and Juliet even sadder! The song, ""You Raise Me Up"" was beautiful and tear-jerking! Oh my goodness when it played at the end of the anime, I cried soo much!! 
Character: A large variety of characters that could have been developed a bit more, or gotten a bit more screen time. But, there's my 2 favorites characters Romeo and Juliet, and that is enough for me. The romance and tragic level between Romeo and Juliet destroys my heart everytime I watch/read about them.  
Enjoyment: I enjoyed it so much, and I cried so much watching this anime. The anime isn't the same as the Shakespeare play. Romeo x Juliet has more mythical creatures and overdramatic sad scenes that grasps the attention of the audience more than Shakespeare's original play. Romeo x Juliet is definitely one of the greatest romance stories ever, and one of my favorite stories ever! Everyone must watch or read Romeo x Juliet!

    ""Just another adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most popular plays. Boring."" This was more or less what I thought when I stumbled upon Romeo x Juliet a while ago. One look at the opening credits of this anime suggested that I may have judged it too hastily, and 24 episodes later I knew I was definitely wrong. 
It's a difficult task to improve upon the original story of Romeo and Juliet, a tremendous tale full of romance and tragedy. This anime adaptation pays a lot of respect to Shakespeare's famous work, and yet also manages to throw in so much of it's own ideas. Unlike the 1996 American film adaptation which was set in modern-day Verona, the anime changes the setting to Neo Verona, an aerial continent. Incorporated into this new fantasy setting are elements such as dragon steeds and enchanted trees. Rather than having two warring families on equal grounds, the anime instead depicts the Montagues as the dominant family, who force the Capulets into hiding for several years. The main theme of the story remains the same, with an ill-fated love between Romeo and Juliet accompanied by a rebellion by the Capulets towards the Montagues. However, the anime also includes many action scenes which gives the series plenty of energy and excitement. No matter how much one wishes against it though, the anime stays true to its roots and provides a tearjerker of an ending. 
The animation in Romeo x Juliet is excellent during the first half of the series, but unfortunately there is a dip in quality during the second half. The character models are simple but effective, whereas the city of Neo Verona is shown in great detail and full of vibrant colours. The action sequences are also well animated. 
The musical score supports this anime very well, and most of the tracks are used at the most suitable moments to create uplifting, dramatic, or sad atmospheres. The narrative is also superb, keeping in tone with Shakespeare's original play by including lines which use an older style of English as well as many of his quotes. The opening song (Inori ~ You Raise Me Up) is extremely soothing and fits the overall theme of the story perfectly. However, the first ending song doesn't suit this anime at all, whereas the second ending is fairly average when compared to the opening. 
The characters in Romeo x Juliet don't disappoint either, and a lot of them feel like a breath of fresh air to the story. If you've seen or read the original play, forget what you already know about Mercutio and Tybalt, because they (among a few others) have different backgrounds and personalities. There are quite a number of new characters introduced, including one who is basically Shakespeare himself! The side characters are interesting to a certain extent in their own little ways, and provide decent support to the main leads. Surprisingly, the background of Romeo’s father is explored in quite a bit of detail, which partly helps to explain why he acts like a tyrant. Then we come to Romeo and Juliet, who as expected get the most screentime and development out of the whole cast. The length of the series allows it to take the time to develop each of the two main leads individually and thoroughly; Romeo has a strong desire to help others despite a lack of affection from his tyrannical father, whereas Juliet masquerading as a hero of justice is a great idea and provides another dimension to her character (she can handle a sword just as well as anyone in this show). The chemistry between the two feels very realistic and heartwarming, and never too cheesy.  
Romeo x Juliet is a great series to watch, feeling familiar yet new at the same time. The main part of Shakespeare's play is still here, but there are so many other aspects to it too. The pacing of the story slows down a little during the middle section (due to the two leads embarking on their own separate adventures for a while), but any other flaws aren't noticeable enough to detract from the enjoyment too much. Definitely recommended.

    In a word: disappointing.  The early episodes showed the potential to be an exciting and imaginative spin on an old classic; but it wound up being dragged down by serious pacing problems and a plot that was all over the place. There were too many things that seemed to happen for no particular reason other than they needed a dramatic plot development at that moment.  
Sometimes a mediocre story can be saved by the characters.  The characters in this series are likeable enough and several have the potential to be interesting, but most of the time their development is too lacking or rushed to be satisfying.  Particularly frustrating is Juliet herself, whom they try to present as a 'strong and spirited heroine' through the old shoujo shorthand of having her dress as a boy and swing a sword around; but she always seems to forget how to use it and trip over her own feet any time Romeo, Curio, Tybalt, or any other guy needs to dramatically come to her rescue. 
Even as simple eye candy, the show doesn't quite measure up.  Although the character and environment designs are gorgeous, the animation is inconsistent from episode to episode.  (Also, if you're going to have flying horses as a major element in a series, you'd better make sure you have the budget to animate them decently!)

    When i first saw the title, i though it would be quite a cliche anime since the story itself is quite well known. But i must applaud the effort put in by the studio in adding a lot of extra detail while still being able to maintain the original storyline. Myself being a fantasy lover was immediately taken in by the flying horses and mythical tree. I think that they made the story more interesting and enhanced the mood,especially the drama in the show. So in terms of the story it was quite well done in my opinion and should not be taken lightly because of its title. 
The artwork was fairly good, although i don't pay that much attention to the artwork,there were certainly no noticeable flaws in the animeand the characters were drawn quite well. 
The Songs in the show were quite an interesting selection. The opening was a surprise to me in that i never imagined there would be japanese version of the song &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, but it fitted well with the anime. The ending was more upbeat then the opening which i squite different from your usual anime but i guess i dont detest it since its something different fro a change. The inserts of the english version of the opening helps to enhance the mood in the story and her voice is amazing. 
The Characters is of course what makes the story so great.However, in this anime too much focus is on the main characters and the supporting characters do not get much showtime, so it is a bit onesided. But they still used the supporting character well to create the setting i shant spoil it.It is also interesting to see William in the anime acting as if the story actually originated from this anime and his presence is another interesting feature of this anime 
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime because i myself am a romance-drama anime fan. But i found it different from the original shakespeare version and it draws me in. The conflict and burden of the names that the two must carry draws in the audience and the ending is somewhat satisfying even though it is meant to be a tragedy, it was portrayed in a manner that seems like a happy ending which is good because i hate those open endings. 
Overall, it is a good anime worth watching and should not be judged based on its title, i hope this was helpful to whoever reads it, its only my first review though.

    Added new depth to the classic William Shakespeare tail Romeo and Juliet. 
I had a few doubt going into this series, but my misgivings were quickly put to rest, I thought it might turn out like the Leonardo DiCaprio movie Romeo and Juliet, the movie was pretty bad. Thankfully the anime series is a whole lot better. 
Romeo X Juliet is a extraordinary anime series. There is the same story of two waring families, and the two children from the families falling in love. There are so many things that make this a great anime series. First the story, sure there's the same classic story, but GONZO added much more and new twists to the story. The world the anime series takes place in is wonderful. A mysterious land floating in the sky, winged horese, and of course the Tree called Escalus. The mystery behind the floating land is the real story. The love story, between Romeo and Juliet is just a added benefit. 
The characters were also amazing. GONZO brought many changes to them, adding more life to them than in the classic play. Characters from Lady Portia(Romeo's Mother), William, Ophelia, and many more. 
Next is the music, which is excellent on par with Fullmetal Alchemist, but a notch below Cowboy Bebop. 
Finally the animation is done by GONZO. The did a stunning job with Romeo X Juliet, it just amazes me how good a job they do. 
Overall Romeo and Juliet is a classic anime series, and is in my top 5 anime series I've seen

    From the name of the anime, you can tell what it will be about, based on Shakespeare's original work.  
Even from watching the opening theme, you can see that the series does not appear to be like the original, so don't expect it and judge this series based on that. For example... flying horses? 
The story is extremely well played out. The only reason why I didnt rate the story any higher was that sometimes, the fantasy elements were too much, and didnt always fit in *spoiler* (Escalus). Only at the very end do all the elements fit together. Although almost everyone knows how a Romeo and Juliet story should end, you cant help but anticipate what twist Gonzo will throw in. Most of the story's details are different from the original, but all the underlying themes are there. 
The art is beautiful. The character designs are different from commonplace anime designs, and the backgrounds are amazing. 
The music is amazing. The opening theme suits the anime very well. The insert song in episode 7 was AMAZINGLY placed and well done... brought me to tears. The ending songs are also good, but at first they dont seem to fit. But as you sit and listen to it and think about the episode.. it just feels right. 
I liked the characters the most in this series. One thing I didnt like about the original story was the love between Romeo and Juliet. It seemed more like infatuation, and there was no development of love between them. In this adaptation. there is actually love. You see the characters struggle and love each other so much. Actually, I havent seen such good relationship development in anime for a while (and this includes romance animes). The other characters, although almost all of them have a different role, all fit their new roles very well.  
I found this series extremely enjoyable and definitely recommend it to any anime viewer who enjoys adaptations, and a clean anime full of love and struggle.

    An anime version of Romeo and Juliet? Interesting.  
But its a loose adaptation. Very loose. Don't expect Romeo X Juliet to be like the original Shakespeare play. This review, is written by a person who never read the play but has researched enough about it. Arguably, all the characters in this anime are made differently, unintentionally or not, from their counterparts. And from these traits we get an awfully plentiful disagreeing opinions. 
Now for a detailed review... 
Story: 6 
The discussion of this part is going to be longer than the others because its the core of the anime, being an ""adaptation."" Let us begin with the basics; the original Romeo and Juliet is a very romantic tragedy with intense passion and drama of two very young lovers from enemy clans. And undeniably, it could be the most famous love story written, romanticizing love at a very high level. Also, the play has many social and societal issues that are heavy for younger people. 
But, Romeo X Juliet defied the themes of the original by setting a different, lighter mood through a fantasy world. It was not made to adapt the original at all. The given conflict of the Capulet and the Montagues' dispute is briefly introduced to give way to additional plot lines such as oppression of the masses, heroism and coming of age. In context, this anime does not fall short of creativity in interpretation and twists in respect to the Shakespeare's play. 
And of course, the heart of the story is the love between Romeo and Juliet- romance. And I can say that made a good job in creating interesting sweet and innocent love story between the two characters through memorable cinematic scenes. It was further made good by many emotional lines and dialogues, both original and quoted from the play itself, that are appropriately romantic.Those wonderful aesthetic qualities combined with the challenges the two must face warms up the interesting and the well-paced story. 
However, though it has many notable rare qualities, its full of inconsistencies and wasted potential. I repeat, a lot of wasted potential; foreshadowing and the plot itself. Somehow, this anime introduces a lot of unconventional and promising conflicts, especially at the beginning, that disappointingly, unexplored further or left hanging. The Capulet and the Montagues' dispute was rather shallow and offers cliched character involvement which will be elaborated later in the review. Other notable examples could be the new characters, duty and a possible forbidden love. 
The anime has a bad habit of introducing something big and exciting, and suddenly replacing it with in-character yet obvious internal conflicts, and gets resolved in a manner that's nothing brilliant. In par with this, many sub-plots have thin links with the main focus of the show. And most probably, the greatest weakness of the anime was the short climax build-up that lacks intensity. And the ""climax"" itself, a poor attempt to adapt the ending of the original, is totally unrelated to the path leading to it. Lastly, there are some important plot devices that makes very little sense at all. 
But one thing makes all of these work: Romeo and Juliet. Their fairy-tale like romance is just so addictive because of its innocent nature. Ideally, they're in love, but in a mature perspective, its an obvious infatuation and a very compatible friendship. Its not intense, passionate and dark but rather the opposite.  And of course, if they're together, they make it look that everything will work out. Well, the series did work out because of them, the anticipation of a different ending is a driving force to finish the series. 
Pure romance is excellent, everything else that complements it are mediocre. 
Artistically, this anime has done very well in dramatizing the themes with an excellent opening. Not only that, as I mentioned, cinematography and the bright mood of lovely scenes made its romance element noteworthy. However, the setting, the clothes, the building designs, appropriate they be, are nothing exceptional or new for they are based of from real life designs, except the pegasus perhaps. Romeo and Juliet's color schemes work well andare memorable.  
Animation is another downer. It was inconsistent at most. 
The opening song itself ""Inori (You raise me up)"" by Lena Park raised the score of this anime. It was beautiful, intense and well performed and placed in appropriate scenes in different themes. Disappointingly, the endings songs are pale in comparison with it. 
Background music is as inconsistent with the story. It is very touching, light, mellow with Romeo and Juliet scenes and anything concerning romance. It adds up to the feeling of love in many scenes and makes them more memorable. So; the light romantic element itself is again portrayed exceptionally, everything else seems so bland and lacking. 
A Code Geass Review has this line but I guess it will be very appropriate to put it here too: 
""All the world's a stage, 
And all the men and women merely players; 
They have their exits and their entrances; 
And one man in his time plays many parts..."" - Shakespeare 
William itself is in the anime, a nice caricature. Though he has minimal involvement he his comments are a nice homage and perspective to what what happening.  
The characters in the anime are different and can be considered ""twisted"" versions of the original. Let us begin with the main protagonists; Romeo and Juliet: 
Juliet is probably the true heroine of the story and she is very tradition defying one. She's considerably lacks maturity, evident from her views, actions and emotional responses. Yet, her strength and capabilities in leadership and combat pushes a fairly well development on her side. And being torn between her duty and her feelings for Romeo, the way she overcomes the hurdles of of these internal struggles is something that only few female characters achieved. The used metaphor for actions, also for her love and determination she shared with Romeo, the ""wind"" suits her role in stirring a revolution and going against the odds. She's apparently more level-headed than the original Juliet. 
Romeo too, is a very unique prince, because his role of a child of an influencial/evil person, a kindhearted noble who advocates reform, well mannered, naive and innocent nature are the usual stereotypes for lead heroines: That's right, mainly princesses. But he fitted his role well and it's in tandem with his idealism and pure, young love for Juliet. And amazingly,none of these traits badly affect his male protagonist image, but rather it makes him more lovable and adorable. On the other hand, the real Romeo is impulsive, violent and too passionate according to some sources. 
Romance worked out very well between the two, but again, mostly everything else is utterly mediocre. One big flaw is the lack of intense reaction from the other characters regarding RXJ love. It should be outrageous, scandalous, disappointing, shocking- all kinds of emotions to further juxtapose love. But all the characters are lacking in that area so the challenges RxJ face aren't romantic in nature themselves but rather situational or societal. Personal issues are always defeated by love. And like what I explained earlier, those conflicts have wasted big potentials. 
The best example of poor character involvement is the repetitive ""Montagues are evil"" and ""The Capulets must be destroyed."" And the reason for that? Cliches... 
Through all those negative attributes, the side characters are not that bad at all. There is the presence of nice best friends like Benvolio and Cordelia. Loyal protector with interesting little secrets and personalities like Curio and Francisco are very likable. The cast from the original play is certainly ""animated"" here, as alternate persons. Although the background people are decent enough, some of them made no contribution to the overall drama; just creating additional insignificant situations. 
This is very opinionated and based on my preference; I had high hopes for this series but I was very disappointed. But I can say that I did enjoy it, especially the lovely scenes between RxJ. It succeeds in making the audience experience the kind of love that is shared between the two. I makes people ""fall in love.""

    I went into this anime not expecting to like it very much.  I am not a fan of Shakespeare.  I am also not a fan of plots that showcase war and revenge.  As it turned out, I am, however, a fan of Romeo X Juliet.  
This is NOT your ordinary melodramatic love story.  This is an adventure. 
All of the characters are presented well and integrate with the story seamlessly, allowing this fictional world to brim with life, with living, breathing characters.  Romeo and Juliet are portrayed as strong and brave protagonists that dynamically grow through each episode.  The Capulets quickly become likable comrades plotting against the Montagues through perfect camaraderie, and this coupled with Romeo and Juliet overcoming regular adversities kept me watching.  You can't help but care for them all.  And the romance isn't sappy, but captivating and without a single blemish in its execution.  Best of all, there are no fillers; each episode is dense with quality content. 
Yes, the anime might not adhere to Shakespeare's version to the T, but I loved the enhancements: Juliet as a cool Zorro-like figure, Neo Verona set in the skies, and especially the flying pegasus!   The visuals are fantastic, from character design to setting detail and imagination... everything!  Be sure to watch this one on a large screen.  And the opening, with Lena Park's rendition of ""You Raise Me Up""... a slice of heaven right there.  I wasn't a fan of the ending though, and the more magical aspects of this anime (e.g. the tree near the end) did not seem to fit very well.   
Please try it.  The first few episodes should be all it takes.

    Firstly, it's important to point out that the name of this series is NOT &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for a reason, that being it's not a clone of Shakespeare's original play. Now, I for one find that there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but for those who are either expecting the famous classic or cannot bear to see an exploratory remake, this series is NOT for you. 
Okay, that out of the way... 
Romeo X Juliet is a fantasy spin on its namesake with adorable characters and a team of well placed seiyū- including my personal favorite Ryōtarō Okiayu (e.g: Byakuya from Bleach). Much like the play it is based on, this series holds a combination of romance, drama, and conflict. However, unlike Shakespeare's original piece, the various plots and stories within (there are about 3) could actually stand on their own.  
Sticking true to its predecessor, Romeo and Juliet are nobles from opposing households who fall in love and as a result must embark on numerous obstacles in order to be together. The twist to this tale, aside from the fantasy element, is that the bloodline of one household has been almost completely eradicated by the other, and its sole survivor is pressed to take revenge not just in retaliation, but for the good of an entire country. Combine such a journey with the conflicting hearts of the story's protagonists, and those that support and are against them, and you come out with a potentially interesting tale. Unfortunately, the series was not able to follow through on such potential, and came up lacking. 
The romance aspect, which is the story's backbone, does not have the intense passion and heart throbbing intrigue as one would expect from anything associated with 'Romeo and Juliet'. Rather, it comes across as very forced, and until the story's end it may have been better for everyone involved had the two lovers stuck to simply being friends. 
Another of its plot - remember I said there are about three - seems not only heavily out of place, but down right ridiculous as its presence is what determines the fate of the anime's hero and heroine...nope, I will not say what it entails as that alone would be one major spoiler. 
Another reason why the story was unable to realize its full potential, lays with the horrendous character design of Juliet. It is obvious that the female protagonist was meant to be shown as a strong and capable female, but instead she comes across as flat, worthless, selfish, and highly annoying. This may be the reason that the romance between her and Romeo failed to come across with any sort of intensity, as her personal character was so lacking that she is the last person best suited for a someone like Romeo. Romeo, with his genuine heart, spontaneity and naivety, comes across as so real and immensely lovable, that to hand him off to one such as Juliet is a moral felony. Unlike Juliet's superficial emotions, Romeo's feelings come across with such immense depth that I can say he is the only one of the two who really knew how to love, and was in love. 
The other characters are very noteworthy. Once again, I must point out that since things have been changed from the original play, do not be surprised that it affects the characters as well. However, despite their change, the main elements that made them unique in Shakespeare's original, still holds very true to them in the series. It is easy to get caught up in how drastic the changes are, but if you take a breather and step back, you will see that it really works for them - the core is still the same. 
My personal favorites, aside from Romeo, are Francisco (the story's bijin because you know there just had to be at least one) and Curio - Juliet's bodyguards who do indeed lash out at the heroine when she is being fickle (much to my pleasure),  Willy - who is very noteworthy as you can say he depicts the role of Shakespeare and it is this experience that has caused the original tale to come about, and Antonio - Juliet's pint sized, side-kick with a heart of strength and gold. 
The Art in the series is nothing to rave about. It is simply Decent where the main characters are the only ones who get much artistic attention (which is far cry away from being detailed), and people in the background are portrayed with bland outlines and fillings. The backdrop - buildings, landscape and etc...range from Poor to Decent as one would expect much more from a fantasy setting. The color is not as bright and whimsical as it should have been, given its genre and setting, and things do appear painstakingly bland. 
The Music was a disappointment. There is barely, if anything, remarkable about the soundtrack. There is nothing that will captivate and reel you in. There are no tunes that will make you feel the anguish and beauty of love and the character's situation, and there is nothing riveting for moments of battle or dark scenes. 
All in all, it was quite a chore to sit through 24 episodes of this. Things did not start to get interesting (at least, as interesting as it could get for this series) until about the 10th episode and then it fell yet again. I was very happy when it ended. 
It's important to note that my dislike for the anime has nothing to do with the changes to the original piece - If anything I really enjoyed that much and I honestly think that Shakespeare himself would applaud it as well...this coming from a Shakespeare fanatic. It is poor because it had such great potential, such a talented staff, but it did not follow through.

    I decided to watch this series on a complete whim. As a lover of tragedies and angst, I've always liked the original Shakespearian play well enough, despite its many flaws. Unfortunately, if the original play had many flaws, then this incredibly loose adaptations has them tenfold. 
STORY - There's no hiding from it. This series is a horrible bastardization of Shakespeare's play and retains very few similarities beyond character names, references, and the fact that Romeo and Juliet have the purest and most cliche love for each other ever! That said, the changes made are interesting, if nothing else. The fantasy elements don't seem important at first, but devour the series at the end, which I found very unpleasant and unnecessary. Indeed, the second half the series, because that's where most of the major divergence from the original play occurs, I found to be less entertaining than the first. Everything just got very repetitive after a while and I found myself not caring at all about the fate of the characters, which is never a good thing. 
But even the story for the first half of the series wasn't very impressive in general, and even now, I'm not sure why I even bothered to finish off the series. The pacing was haphazard and there were far, far too many redundant scenes involving Romeo and Juliet's apparent infatuation with each other, not to mention certain character repeating themselves a thousand times, as if you didn't already know what was going on. I'm all for the romantic fluff, but come on, this is stupid. In summary, there was nothing great about the story of Romeo x Juliet at all, and that's considering I did like the original well enough. I suppose then, if you really didn't even like the original, you wouldn't find anything of interest here at all. 
CHARACTER - I didn't really like any of the characters in RxJ. It was really kind of sad. I was especially disappointed that Mercutio's role was diminished greatly until near the end of the series and even then, he was not the character he was in the original -- upsetting because there, he was my favorite. Not to mention that he was incredibly out of character. Tybalt was similarly unrecognizable, but at least he remained Juliet's cousin, unlike Benvolio, who was no longer Romeo's cousin. Romeo and Juliet themselves were kind of... eh. Well, Romeo was a great, big pussy with that cliche sense of idealism and justice. This made him incredibly annoying for the entirety of the series, and I found it hard to sympathize with any pain and suffering he went through.  
Juliet was probably the most interesting character in the series, which really isn't saying much, but hey. Because she was forced to dress like a man all her life (to keep her identity a secret), she had a lot of boyish qualities about her and was therefore a little more badass than her original counterpart. This made it kind of interesting, but as the series progressed, she lost her male persona and her stereotypical girly qualities kind of took over, including lots of ridiculous heartbreak/lonely scenes that were full of ridiculous. 
I found the stark good guy/bad guy division in this series to be incredibly boring. There didn't seem to be very many shades of grey and it was basically CAPULETS GOOD, MONTAGUES BAD, or at least, Lord Montague was the definition of EVILLLLL. This was painfully obvious in all interactions between Romeo and Lord Montague (his father).  Cliche character personalities are cliche. They tried to rectify this a little at the end by giving Lord Montague some pathetic sobstory to explain why he was the way he was, but it wasn't very convincing at all, and I certainly wasn't impressed. 
ARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - I really dislike the style RxJ is drawn in. The noses are just ginormous, and I don't like it. :( Other than that though, the animation in the opening is bloody gorgeous... too bad it doesn't carry into the series! Overall, I'd say the animation in the actual episodes was pretty average, maybe on the lower end of average though. I was especially not fond of how they treated equine anatomy, but that may just be me. 
MUSIC - The opening theme for RxJ is a Japanese cover of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (which has apparently been covered more than 125 times, according to Wiki). About half the music in the series was also this song, including an English cover by the same singer, and various instrumentals. Most of the other music was pretty negligible, probably because this theme is what stands out the most. It's a pretty song though and the artist, Lena Park, has a very nice voice. The end theme is okay, but nothing amazing. 
DUBBING/VOCALS - I saw this entire series subbed. Nothing stood out as good or bad, so I guess average all around. 
OVERALL - As you can see, this was a pretty mediocre series all around, and it's no wonder it wasn't very popular at all. Like I said, I still don't understand exactly why I got so hooked (I saw the entire series in about three days), especially since I'd recognize its sub par quality from the very beginning, but I did, so I guess there has to be some redeeming qualities about it... I just can't really think of any right now. But that might be because I really hated the ending, which I found incredibly lame! In conclusion, I don't recommend this in particular unless you're really curious or really bored. :3

    Title: Romeo x Juliet 
Manga, Anime: Romeo x Juliet does have a manga spinoff, with art done by COM and story still done by Gonzo and Sky Perfect Well think, that began running in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka on March 24th, 2007.  It is still running at this point in time, and has yet to be licensed Stateside. 
Romeo x Juliet is a twenty-four episode anime that was produced by Gonzo (famous for their work on Gankutsuou and Saikano) and directed by Fumitoshi Oisaki (this was his first major work as a director).  It ran from April 4th to September 26th, 2007 on Japanese TV, and, contrary to Funimation's giving subbers a cease and desist (which was on supposedly on behalf of Gonzo's requests for them to enforce Japanese copyright laws), the anime has NOT been licensed Stateside. 
Story: Fourteen years ago, on the floating continent of Neo-Verona, the Montagues led a coup against the Capulets, and slaughtered the entire family, except for a young girl and her servant.  The girl, in the meantime, has been bought up as a boy, Odin, and kept in hiding, occasionally going out as the masked vigilante the Red whirlwind.  On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the day when her true identity is to be revealed, she meets Romeo, the son of the Montagues... 
As you can tell, this is an EXTREMELY loose adaptation of the story.  And, honestly, it had the chance to be good.  However, the story has issues, and lots of them.  And to cover them requires some SPOILERS, so read ahead at your own risk 
First of all centers in the adaptation of the story.  It's absolutely bare-bones: two star-crossed lover from rival families who die. I'm not a Shakespeare purist at all, but dear GOD, they fucked a lot up.  They can't decide when to use Shakespearean dialogue or when to adapt it, or when to keep scenes from the original play in just to remind people that yes, this is an adaptation.  And for the recored, they fucked up the balcony scene in the extreme.  I'm sorry, but you have to be really trying with a vengance to mess it up. 
Another major problem in this is the characters.  Gonzo might have been able to pull this off if they'd kept the original personalities from Shakespeare.  Instead, Romeo becomes a naive whiny little brat who waxes philosophically (and unconvincingly) about justice and freedom and peace once he is sent to work in the mines by his father (Maoist China, plz?), Juliet can't decide whether she wants to be a shoujo heroine destined to lead a revolution and avenge her parents or a whiny little Mary-Sue moping over her angsty past and her TRU WUV with Romeo, not to mention that she's supposedly uber-skilled with a sword, but makes incredibly stupid beginners mistakes at several critical times, and Tybalt, probably my favorite out of the whole lot, is dark and brooding and actually doesn't coddle Juliet, unlike most of the cast.  Other characters from other Shakespeare plays are thrown in haphazardly, but don't hold your breath waiting for them to be like in other plays; they're all butchered versions of their former selves (like most everyone else from the original Romeo and Juliet), most of whom are fawning over and coddling either Romeo or Juliet or both.  Background stories for some major characters (such as Tybalt and the generic evil tyrant Montague) don't come until later in the series, and when they do, it's just more WTF (Montague is a son of the Capulets and got adopted into the Montagues and backstabbed his way to the top in order to get his revenge on the Capulets for mistreating his mother, who was, in fact, a whore; and Tybalt is apparently the son of Montague and a Capulet woman - again, WTF?!)  The biggest issue with characters is the fact that NONE of them get any development; they're all one-note personalities running around in circles for most of the series.   
This, in turn, is compounded by the issue that, for most of the series, THERE IS NO PLOT.  It's either Juliet running around with Romeo in puppy love, angsting, or attempting to lead a revolution but failing at swordfighting when she's supposedly amazing at it, while Romeo either runs around with Juliet, tries to kindly let down his arranged fiancee, or starts to realize just what a douche his father is.  Gonzo tries to build the series on Romeo and Juliet's TRU WUV, but the most that it is is puppy love, as they never meet for anything more than six minutes, yet this is enough for them to decide to run away together about halfway through the series and marry each other and set up house in a pastoral village out in the middle of nowhere.  (...Then again, it was kind of like this in the original play, so they got that aspect down, to some degree.)  They get captured, though, and Romeo goes off to the mines to have a slight development arc that makes him even more annoying at the end of it, and Juliet goes off to finally lead that revolution (which is instigated by something so fucking EASY that it's a wonder they didn't try this years ago, let alone the other five times that the revolution failed in this series!).  And when the revolution comes about, it's glossed over to make room for the random tree that apparently keeps Neo Verona in the sky and that is dying because of the Montagues, and apparently Juliet is the next sacrifice to keep it alive.  This brings about the situation in the last two episodes that I bought up back in the third paragraph.  To say the least, this thing is a fucking MESS. 
In short, the whole story is made of FAIL.  There are bits of redemption that come through in Tybalt here and there, but all in all, this was just made of suck.  And you wonder where it comes from, because on the one hand, you've got stuff like Saikano, and Bokurano, and Gankutsuou (which was an EXCELLENT adaptation), and then on the other, you've got THIS. 
Art: Neo-Verona is absolutely beautiful.  Gonzo really tried to emulate classical Italian Renaissance architecture in its construction, and they did it well.  The winged horses that show up here and there in the series are pretty neatly designed and executed as well. 
The character designs could've been done better, I think.  Most everyone in this show looks pretty generic -- well-animated, for the most part, but fairly generic.  And there are times when it was pretty obvious that they were trying to save budget with pan shots, still frames, and glossing over fight scenes.  The animation quality dropped every once in a while, too. 
Music: The background music for this was a study in extremes: it was either melodramatic or overdramatic string orchestra, to match the ""epic"" fight scenes and ""dramatic"" revelations, or soft and gentle string and piano numbers, to match the ""tender"" moments and the angst.  All in all, it took the suckiness to whole new places. 
The two versions of the OP and its instrumental, a cover of Josh Groban's ""You Raise Me Up"" by Lena Park, were used at several points in the series, and even if I didn't really like where it was used, I liked the songs themselves.  The first ED, ""Cyclone"" by 12012, was a pretty nice rock piece as well.  I didn't like the second ED all that much, as it was another female emo ballad, which we kind of already had in the OP. 
Seiyuu: Overall, the seiyuu for this did a good job in portraying their characters, even if I hated their characters' guts.  Props especially to Tybalt and Montague's seiyuu, who pitched their voices so that they matched, something I didn't recognize till I saw them in scenes that happened one right after the other, which was a hint to a major (if slightly WTF-ish) plot point. 
Length: Honestly?  I think this series shouldn't have even been able to get off the ground -- whoever greenlighted this should probably get fired. 
But, in the long run, this was just way too long.  I was starting to get sick of this around episode 13.  If they went and retooled the whole damn thing (and maybe took care of the issues with the plot and the characters), they should've been able to wrap this up in about sixteen to twenty episodes, and had a chance of it being decent, too. 
Overall: A pretty, well-acted series that, unfortunately, is an EXTREMELY loose adaptation of the original has nothing resembling a plot for most of its entirety, and when it does get a plot, it's quite WTF-ish, one-note characters that, for the most part, you will HATE with a passion by the third episode (except maybe for Tybalt) and music (save for the OP and the first ED) that doesn't help its case. 
Stay as far away from this series as possible.

    Overall I believed it was a very good story. It goes along the basic storyline of the Shakespeare version, but I thought that the twists and extra pieces really made it unique and likeable. 
I loved the music, it really went well with the anime and the mood of the story. I also loved the opening and ending music. 
Each episode was a sort of cliffhanger, which made me want to watch the rest of them in a row (but couldn't). When I did, I felt kind of sad that it wasn't long enough.  
Some of the characters that have more similar roles in both this anime and the Shakespeare story were excellent. Oveall the characters were well thought out and drawn (animated). 
If you haven't watched it, I recommend watching it with an open mind. Don't limit yourself to thinking it will just be like the Shakespeare play, and I'm sure you'll be surprised, pleased and love most, if not all, moments in this anime laid out before you.

    Going into this series, I admit that I had braced myself for more of a tragedy than this.  Having acted in the original play, I know just how depressing and plain ol' emo it can be.  But this is truly something different. 
Story:  First off, the story is much more moving and uplifting than I was expecting.  There were times when I was actually moved to tears by the responses of characters to each other.  The story just barely follows Shakespeare's original story.  Basically put, if you're looking for an anime rendition of his story, you're looking in the wrong place.  This is not to say that the story is bad in any sense of the word.  Rather, I think that Shakespeare would be proud of this expansion to his original story. 
Art:  I'd have to say that the art section is the most disappointing of all.  Thankfully, this isn't saying too much.  The art from front to back is very well done.  Some of the townsfolk felt a little bit cheapened but I would count this as making sure the story is focused on who it should be. 
Sound:  I have to admit, I'm extremely impressed with the sound from this anime.  From the musical compositions to the sound effects to the voice acting to one of the better renditions of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (performed by Lena Park).  As far as audio goes, darn impressive. 
Characters: Only a couple of characters weren't all that impressive.  However, all of the key players are very well developed.  All of the seiyuu who performed did an excellent job indeed.  This really helped to bring out the characters personalities and brought life.

    What can we expect from a title that says Romeo x Juliet? Probably a cheesy and draggy remade version of the original story that has no dept whatsoever.  
But I was utterly wrong. Simply bear in mind that this is the Anime Version of Romeo and Juliet, and expect what you'll expect from most anime for eg, fantasy. I'm no fan of Shakespear's work but I do know the general outline of the story and the important scenes such as the balcony which audience will get to enjoy during the course of the series (although I'm guilty of laughing at that part).  
Story wise - Firstly, I'm very impressed by the various climax and exciting moments in this series. The first 10 episodes or so will keep you on your toes while tugging your emotions along with the sweet and tragic moments of our main characters. Following episodes then mellow down, and just when I thought it's gonna get boring here forth the story picks up again and you just have to keep watching. ie. damn high priority. However, you may find yourself with a big &quot;huh?!&quot; at the last few eps. Yes there's where the Fantasy kicks in although if you have watched enough anime, you'll know that this is a typical storyline and thus befitting for this series as well. In general, the story was well remade for an anime indeed. 
Art - The style may be a little hard to stomach for some but fret not, you'll get used to it in 1 or 2 episodes' time. The background was beautiful in some scenes especially the extensive flower beds. In fact, during the course of watching this series, I actually felt that it's well drawn because the characters doesn't have oversized eyes (or boobs) or overly skinny limbs, unlike some other animes. 
Sound - Needless to say, the opening is one where you'll keep listening to even after completing the series. Images from the anime will then naturally float into your mind. Yes that's how influential Lena Park's version of You Raise Me Up is. 
Character - For this portion, I'll really have to give the director a big hug. Setting the side characters aside, the mental development of both our hero and heroine was well-balanced and developed. The romance between the 2 was nicely presented while slowly telling the audience how they fell in love. This part was absolutely perfect because a plain love-at-first-sight thing would cause the story to lose its meaning and turn me off quickly. 
Despite it being a great anime, I've gotta admit the presence of my fan-girling moments during the exceptionally sweet and touching moments which were strewed here and there. So fellow babes, watch this to ignite the shoujo heart in you!

    As someone who is not a real fan of shounen, sci-fi or not particularly fantasy either, Aria does not look like the show I’d enjoy a lot. Or to put it in other words, the introductory page of the show with its sci-fi and futuristic elements created a completely different image in my head than my personal experience of it. It is in no way a typical example of the above-mentioned genres and it is always a worthy experience when a show transcends your preconceived ideas.  
Aria, as the synopsis already reveals, takes place in Aqua, formerly known as Mars, a completely ‘man-made’ world. Within this brave new world, the story centers on a young girl who aspires to be a great undine in the canals of Neo Venezia, a place that reminisces Venice in Manhome.  Contrary to what you’d expect from a futuristic show, the series does not offer a world that is a continuation of life on earth but rather a re-start, (even the names of the characters all starting with A gives us an Adam-like sense of a fresh beginning) thus, offering a world devoid of the robotic experiences of the technological urban life. Here, you are exposed to beautiful scenery of Neo Venezia, like a guest in the gondolas of sweet undines, gazing through the city surrounded by nature and the serenity that comes with it. Not to mention the relaxing music that accompanies you in every step of the way. 
Another interesting aspect of the series that I did not expect is the way the ‘story’ is revealed. If you expect to get curious about what is going to happen next, it is not the case with Aria. The whole experience is like the acknowledgement of little things in life that are more than enough to make someone happy. Instead of a storyline, the series reflects an alternative dream-like world, an anime version of Neverlamd,so to speak. The imaginary elements such as gondoliers being called undines - mythological nymphs - and the top three gondoliers being the three water fairies add to the man-made, dreamy nature of Aqua. Here, you can get away from the worries of mundane life affairs and take it easy. If anything, it is not a travel to the future but to the depths of human nature, revealing its secrets, wishes, and dreams. 
As can be inferred from what I already mentioned, thematically, the show focuses on what it means to be human, how to appreciate the small things we normally take for granted in life and more than anything, what it means to be able to dream without any boundaries of the adult perspective on life.  
If you need some tranquility and recharge for your soul, this show surely feels like a warm hug and the whole experience will tickle you all the way to the end, letting you take a taste of exploring the future in the most nostalgic manner possible. Wish you all a good sappy time!

    If you guys are thinking about what anime to watch next, then I could not recommend Aria enough. I've just finished watching the first season and holy shit was it beautiful. The music, the animation, the artwork, the storyline! Everything syngerized so well together. Sure, the genre is slice-of-life, but then again, so was Clannad, was it not? Once I've finished my errand that I needed to attend to, I'm so going to watch the Aria the Natural. It is a fucking beautiful anime and it makes me a little mad that such anime like Aria have now become, for lack of a better metaphor, diamond in the rough. 
The manga equivalent is just as good as well. The artwork is nice and it the manga does go more in-depth story-wise. However, I'd recommend watching the anime ONLY for the wondrous harmony of audio and visuals. No other anime have approached audio and visuals the way this had. Not then, not even now. That's because of the genius storyboarding: these writers knew EXACTLY what to do and they've done it fucking well. 
I rarely give out nines and tens to anime and manga series, but this one gets a clear 9.5 out of 10. It is a beautiful anime. Every episode will warm your heart and tug on your heartstrings. It is the anime that you most likely draw some connection to. The tempo is slow and the pacing laid-back. But this is a design-choice. The producers WANTED this to happen due to the inherent nature of the story. As all of you should know by now, the anime adaptation should appropriate the manga. It's synchronous ability to do just that is sublime. 
Watch it! If you're not watching anything else right now, watch Aria. If you're watching something else right now, drop that shit and watch Aria instead. Nah, I kid! Finish that first and then watch the anime.

    Story: it looks like an episodic slice of life on a somewhat fantasy world, but if you rewatch this show or you are a bit smart you may notice the true: this is about a girl who arrives in a fantasy world from a couch, this is a metaphor of the ""Drug's world"".  
Sadly, Aria follows our main character, Akari, who is a 15 years old girl inserted in the drug's world (probably powerful narcotics, or LSD)  by a woman called ""Alicia"". It evens gets more dark when Aria wants you to think Akari doesn't know she is affected by these narcotics "" When i came to Aqua ( Alice's house) i wanted to be ......( i dont want to make any spoiler) ....... but then i started to see everything of this world was awesome (probably because of the narcotics)"", every time i see it that chapter i have to pause, cry and after 4 hours i continue watching. After 3-4 chapters Akari starts having visions of a big cat (2 times more tall than the girl) and fantasy shit.  
The art is beautifull and it gets even better while the anime progresses. You may not like the idea about chibi faces but trust me that chibi shit its so fucking great in Aria, I can't understand why the fuck I liked it. 
The music (ost, opening, ending, what ever) is relaxing and well placed i dont know what well placed means but i am sure Aria did it. The characters' voices are great, someone told me the characters' voices were made by real people. I think if you got surprised as i was for this fact you have another reason to watch Aria. 
The characters aren't clichéd and they perform as a normal person, considering they are normal people living in THE BEST FUCKING PLACE IN THE FUCKING UNIVERSE. Maybe two or three characters may dont seem like normal people the first time you watch it but they are unique.  
Overall: This is a weird show about chibi, adorable characters, drugs, rape and racism ( all the characters' name start with A except for the black guy, even the white cat name starts with A).

    I would say that this show made me feel really good at night... 
But embarrassing remarks aren't allowed ;-; 
So someone told me about an anime series that I had never heard of. He said that it was the greatest ""feel good"" series ever made. He called it the ""Aria"" series. So I looked it up on MyAnimeList and thought to myself, ""Holy crap, this show looks like it's boring as hell."" The part of me that thought that probably thought that it was due to the apparent lack of relatability that this show held. I mean, it's a slice of life, but it's in a fantasy sci-fi world where the planet Mars has been converted into a water planet where humans can inhabit. It follows the lives of freaking boat tour guides. How relatable can this anime get? 
Aria is beautiful in the way it takes such a ridiculously unimaginable world and still makes the ride relatable. It does this through dynamic and colorful character interactions weaved in with little life lessons that we all can learn from. It's a show about enjoying life to the fullest, and it dives into themes that you have probably bumped into during your life. For example, wanting to be a hero! Or that all good things must come to an end. Or that no matter where you are or who you are, there will always be a place where you belong. Combine these lovely themes with one of the most beautiful and peaceful atmospheres in anime, and you get this serene series about life and dreams. 
Pros: 
- Calming and gorgeous atmosphere. Like said before, this is a prime example of a ""feel good"" series. 
- Amazing cast of characters! There were no characters that I actively disliked. 
- One of the best soundtracks in anime. It plays a huge role in setting up the atmosphere of the show. 
- Simple yet still beautiful art. Neo Venezia just looks so cool! 
- Great little life lessons that are executed beautifully! Makes the show incredibly relatable to, even if it's a fantasy. 
- Kick back and relax! 
- No fanservice! OMG!!! 
Cons: 
- A very simple story with no thought required. For people who want a show with even a shred of thinking needed, this one ain't for you. 
- Slow and peaceful, with 0 action. Action fans, go away! 
- Fairly silly and seemingly pointless.  
- This show isn't very laugh out loud and jokes can get repetitive. (It does have its moments though.) 
- No fanservice! OH NO!!! 
Story: 9 
The premise is simple, but also pretty weird to most people. It's about Akari, a young girl and upcoming undine (boat tour guide) who moved from Manhome (Earth) to Aqua (Mars) in order to pursue that career. At first, you may be like... what? Mars? It's now filled with water, hosts a city that looks like Venice, and is actually habitable? The premise makes the setting look like it's completely out of this world, which it is! However, despite this, through the characters interacting with each other, building the world, and living their normal lives, Aria's story and themes are somehow very like our world. People live their lives, chase their dreams, and enjoy life in their own way. In other words, Aria is truly a Slice of Life. It isn't cute girls doing cute things, it's people doing normal things. 
So Aria's story is just slice of life. What's the main overlooking theme of the entire series? That, my friend, is miracles. Aria convinces you that miracles don't just exist, they can be created by hand. Just look at Aqua! A formerly uninhabitable planet was turned into a beautiful and serene place through the power of human willpower. Nothing can get more miraculous than that. Aria's depiction of miracles is truly beautiful. 
Aria's art is pretty simple as well! It isn't particularly high quality or anything, but it still captures the tranquil atmosphere of a fantasy world incredibly well! The character designs are also great, and the deformation during comedic moments is also hilarious! There isn't much in this show to animate, since it's a slow pace slice of life, but it can pull of high quality animations when it wants.  
Sound: 10 
Probably the best aspect of this series is the OST. It's quite literally porn for the ears. Serene, peaceful, and beautiful, the OST consists of extremely nostalgic pieces either on the piano or strings, and it sets up the amazing and easy going mood of the show incredibly well. Also, the OP and ED are some of the best songs I've ever heard. They both give off extremely nostalgic vibes and are definitely songs that I would listen to on repeat. 
The next best aspect of this series are the characters. The characters aren't particularly special, but they fit their world so well and they definitely carry the story. All of the characters are lovable and have their own unique quirks, and the interactions that they have really pull you in. Also, it's time to talk about their chibi deformations! All of the main undine characters have these incredibly hilarious chibi expressions during comedic scenes, and they each have their own unique one that makes them stand out! Their chibi faces always seem to be screaming out something, such as... 
Akari: Hahi, hohe, what the hell is going on??? 
Aika: Hey! Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed! 
Alice: I'm so done with this bullshit. 
Alicia: Ara ara ara ara. 
Akira: Dafuq did you just call me? 
Athena: Derp. 
Also, President Aria is by far the best pet sidekick character ever conceived. He just has so much personality! 
I smiled like a dork the whole way through. This series lives up to its name as the best ""feel good"" series so far, and I still got 3 more cours to watch! 
A great and peaceful series that you can just sit back, relax, enjoy some tea, and just turn off your brain while watching. While this type of series definitely isn't for anyone, for those that click with it, it'll be a serene experience that you won't want to end. 
TL;DR: ""The world is wonderful in the eyes of wonderful people.""

    Mood & Atmosphere: 
If I can describe this anime in one word, it would be 10/10 NOSTALGIC for me. It really calms you down.  I like watching this anime when I can't sleep. Of course it is not boring for those who like this style of slice of life. Just think of it as a lullaby.  
Plot & Characters: 
There are no major problems in the story like in actions and dramas, and there are no characters to hate. The Characters do develop, but not in a dramatic. Rather, they learn to appreciate more in life. In some ways, it is more about understanding happiness. Characters also learn to accept things as they develop and it will tear you up once in a while. 
Art & Soundtracks: 
Amazingly, the art is very good. Character styles are matched well with their personalities. If you love the slow and easy slice of life like this anime, I am sure you will like the soundtracks.  
Overall: It is a good anime that can make you feel very slow and relax.

    ARIA The Animation is a very beautiful anime that brings you into a potential future for mankind. The life lessons taught in this series really touched my heart and will stay with me forever.Sadly, it seems that this anime is greatly underrated... However, I would recommend this anime to anyone feeling lost in life, and for anyone who needs some cheering up!!

    ""If you're in a drought, watch Aria because it has plenty of water"" LOL 
The story of Aria is is innovation and disappointment. Basically the anime talk for a girl who wants to become a gondolier, is live in new Venice Ancient Mars, yes, Mars Mars has water, lots of water and do not know how... 
The story is: 
- Water. 
- Space. 
- Girl wants to be gondolier. 
-  Lives in ""planet Mars"". 
- weird cats. 
New Venice: why on plante mars and not in earth? It's same city, old buildings but have spacecraft. its an weird anime, compliance errors facing the laws of physics and chemistry makes Aria a anime innovative and strange. 
Highlights that deserve attention: It is a stationary anime without action scenes, exelente to relax after a stressful day at work, the soundtrack is exelence, as well as the lyrical song that thrills. This is differential anime the soundtrack, tf not for her the anime would be boring, this soundtrack makes holding the attention and we stay anxious to what comes next... 
My verdict: Aria is a anime to relax, a simple basic story, may seem confusing, it is a good option for when you have nothing to do.

    *Actual title is ""Free smiles and heart warmth : the Animation."" I believe!* 
Well this is prolly one of the Best SoL anime out there. But as we all know SoL Show are have their own special time you need to watch them. 
I will start with the sounds, which are absolutely magnificent and relaxing ones soul. The lyrics of the songs(Op,Ed,OST) are original and related to the show. Which further invite 'us' the viewers to relate to the show and characters in particular.An amazing job from sounds part! IT was relieving and heart warming.  
Continuing to the characters. As more SoL Shows depend on easily relatable characters so that the viewer can get easily absorbed. Same goes to Aria. The characters are well introduced each with its own traits and weaknesses and each of them influence the others with their unique actions. All together making a great and relaxing company. 
As far as Story is concerned , its pretty simple. We follow the protagonist in her daily Life and learn via her experiences valuable life lessons. You also can say that the show has some pretty serious teachings to deliver but also most of them are widely knows. (was at least for me) 
Probably one of the most Heart warming, relaxing,relatable shows out there. It awakes wide feelings within the viewer. Mostly it tries to appeal to the innocence we all had at some point in our life but we lost it. (Tho it is terribly stupid at some points.)Also the comedy is what i would call mediocre. It is good if you love the characters and its enough to help you maintain a constant grin on your face. But not what you would call hilarious or asphyxiating. Also most of the gags are recycled sadly.Personally I didn't love it much, or laughed.But it did suffice! 
The visuals and animations is oke. Fitting its theme very well but personally but it definitely had some pretty weird CG from time to time. You cannot say it was ugly but you can say not entirely attractive. 
----------------------------------Personal opinion and weak points---------------------------------------- 
If you don't get absorbed into it, there is no chance to like this and some serious problems are created. Personally i found it lacking proper physics and common logic (but that's one of the minor problems). Also there it has some metaphors that i found out of place and the only reason to be there is to add some deep meaning and confuse the viewer.Example,""Become one with the wind."",""I want to deliver my heart to you"",""Sky full of lead colored clouds=clouded sky"", ""those silver angels will...=snow"" etc. Another thing, is that it used 'Engrish' as humour... Worst kind of Japanese comedy ever made imo.I also did a mistake... i watched it one go!... Which slowly started to feel completely bored of it at some points. (I gotta blame myself for it) but it also didn't have any certain goal so as to keep me attached. So we can say its not so attractive you must watch it out of your own volution.BUT 1 major thing i found sad. There are Lots of random stuff trying to add something intriguing stagnant into the show and confuse the plot. Also adding depth...wait..what plot?For example,Wind blowing,Shining Sea,Shining Rows,Weoponized Lens Flare Sun angles.There is a Ski-fi tag but there is no explanation to several obscure phenomena ...(time travel). Last but not least,Unless you are autistic or have some sort of serious mental illness reacting to everything with INTERJECTIONS is something bad other than cute,relaxing and comfortable. 
Despite my salt opinion as long as you get absorbed this is absolutely relaxing and it will offer you a really pleasant feeling.But its really boring if you feel detached no matter how relaxing,calming overwhelming you with happiness, enjoyment it offers.4 hours warm spent. 
Reasons to watch it: 
-Anime is quoting about life and it does it good. 
-Unique feelings of happiness. 
-Only likable characters.

    ""No sappy lines allowed"" 
I have one word to say about this: Predictable 
I don't get what's with everyone's hype with this anime. It's boring, unoriginal, and saccharine. If you are looking for a fast-paced, entertaining anime, then Aria the Animation is not the best choice to watch. Sure it may have a good idea but the story is boring and very slow-paced, not for those looking for action. 
Too much flashbacks, expositions, and development makes this enjoyable likely for people who enjoy slow-paced slice of life anime. But I was having a hard time sitting through this as it has really bad plot issues and there's no story anyway. 
The characters' interactions are pretty saccharine. I understand that the writers were trying to go for a more simple, kid-friendly series but there is little for teens to enjoy. 
Ai-chan was a character that overstays her welcome to begin with. The character itself is not extremely annoying but still not my cup of tea. It would've been good for Akari to interact with her for a little while but making her a secondary character who sends her e-mails was surprisingly rushed. 
The other characters are annoying stereotypes. There are tsunderes and cutesy girls which filled this anime to the point of being unbearable. This could've been done with less development and drama.

    This Anime healed my soul 
Story: 9/10  About a girl who went to a water filled Mars to become an undine. A slice of life series, the pacing is rather slow as compared to modern Animes. But hey, sometimes you just have to take it slow and chillax. Just let the Anime teach how to appreciate all the little things in life. 
Art: 10/10 Art is amazing, this Anime is made way back in 2005, you cannot expect the same level of standard as of today, but the environment, characters and cats are welly drawn and comfortable to look at. Landmarks are distinguishing, a very warm style of art I would say. Feels cozy as I think back. 
Sound: 10/10 The sound is astonishing. It suits the atmosphere of the Anime perfectly. 1 thing they did very well is to have a different opening scene every episode, so I pretty much listened to ""Undine"" (opening of anime) 12 times, the song sorta grew on me. Ending(Rainbow) gives off a very cozy feeling, lyrics fits the Anime really well. The OST in the Anime is marvelous as well, all of them give you a calming feeling, like lullaby. Brings wonders to my ears, they are also superb for studying or when writing a Aria review! 
Character: 9/10 I do not believe a character has to change to be a good character, in the series there are little character development, however, all the character are distinct from one another and are unique in their own rights. Most importantly, they are lovable. They pretty much remain the same throughout the series, but learning the backstory of some of the characters intrigues me.  
Enjoyment: 10/10 Did not finish the whole Anime in one sitting like I usually do. Took me a few days, but everyday I find myself wanting to watch 1 or 2 episodes of Aria, the Anime does not bomb rush you with plot, each episode tells a different excellent story, there is no cliffhanger, perhaps that is why I could not finish the Anime in 1 sitting. But unique idea, the characters, the music and the cats gave me a blast. This Anime is certainly one of the kind. An Anime that tells you simple, warm stories. I would not say that the Anime is deep, anyone can pretty much understand what is going on with just one watch. But the simplicity fits the Anime very well, I mean, it is to take us through all the little things in life.  
Overall: 9/10 I would say the Anime has outdone itself, I always disliked slow pacing Anime, but miraculously I finished this Anime, I do not think I will watch the sequel due to how long an episode is but I will definitely finish the Manga, which the Anime is based on. However, I would recommend this Anime to anyone, if you like watching Anime as compared to reading the Manga, please do check out the sequel, as I heard they are tear-jerking! However, the Anime got an 9 from me, is because the Orange Planet's cat looks weird. I like cute cats that are nice to other cats.

    As far as slice of life anime goes this one is firing on all cylinders, ARIA is truly an SoL masterpiece. The characters are immediately likeable, with the leads Akari & Alicia sympathetic and interesting from the start, with an amazing supporting cast behind them. The story of Lady Gondoliers (aka Undines) on Aqua (aka New Mars) makes for an interesting setting and the likeable cast of character develop in a slow, but steady pace throughout the series, and the story leaves off ready to carry on into the followup series 'The Natural' with a very natural progression. The action is rather subdued and people looking for high action won't find it here, but if you are looking something that is soothing and calming you won't go wrong with ARIA.

    This is probably the first series I’ve ever watched that seriously sucks all the energy out of you (in a good way, mind you). Aria is just so calm and soothing, that you can’t help but feel relaxed afterwards. Because of this tendency, though, this series also took me very long to complete, mainly because of me struggling against the forces of sleepiness (x.x). The calming atmosphere to this series is truly unique, which is probably why Aria has such a great reputation amongst those who like Kuuki-kei “atmosphere”/slice-of-life anime. 
The story takes place on former planet Mars, which is now called Aqua in this series. Aqua is a terraformed Mars, which in itself is quite a unique setting. For those that don’t know what terraforming is, terraforming would be where a normally uninhabitable planet (without water, like Mars) is artificially made habitable by adding plants, water, and other basic necessities. This series is great at portraying the city of Neo Venezia, which is made into a truly charming and diverse setting. The scenery is great, with the all-encompassing presence of water reminiscent of the Italian city of Venice. Perhaps it’s that large presence of water that makes the setting feel so calm and peaceful, and personifies this series perfectly. 
The most notable part to this show is definitely the characters; the characters are so goofy, yet have a nice charm to everything they do. The dialogue between all the characters feels strangely natural, which makes this show both easy to follow, as well as fun to watch. The everyday interactions between all the characters, such as our main character Akari or the company mascot President Aria, are quite innocent yet endearing. The characters’ every day lives aren’t exactly eventful, yet at the same time, are thought provoking and philosophical at times, which sends a often endearing message through it’s characters. Sometimes the characters fit into more generic stereotypes found in anime, but that doesn’t stop the main cast from being fun to watch. The characters are well thought out, and their interactions with their surroundings really produces some genuinely great stories. 
An oddity to this show would be how each episode’s plot is almost completely disconnected with each other. I sometimes found myself clicking ahead one or two episodes by accident, only to realize I actually skipped some episodes later on. Since there is no solid continuing plot, it’s very difficult to get a concrete linear storyline set in mind. I will admit that there are benefits to the disconnected story format, which allows for the introduction of more side characters and some very unique plots, so I guess it all depends on if you feel the format benefits the overall impressions of the show. 
The music, and the sounds of the waves, really helps complement the soothing atmosphere to this show. Production quality wise, the animation is consistent most of the time, but the actual contents of each episode is great to see, with plenty of beautiful scenic panoramic shots throughout the show. There are many who will argue that the plot is too slow and boring, but that’s pretty much all dependent on what you expect from this show. If you’re expecting some sort of action packed, dramatic tear inducing show, Aria is definitely not for you. However, if you don’t mind trying out new types of anime, and could appreciate a more slow paced, well developed yet extremely calming and charming anime, Aria might just be for you. 
Production Quality: 8.0/10 
Characters: 8.5/10 
Story: 8.5/10 
Setting: 8.0/10 
Overall Score: 8.3/10 (rounded down to a 8 on MAL)

    Basically it is your typical &quot;slice of life&quot; anime.. Not many words can describe this show other than lighthearted and a joy to watch.. I really believe that if you are down in the dumps, this show can cheer your up with its sheer randomness and fun.  The characters all have their own persona and even though there is not much history behind each one, one can get a glimpse of themselves in each one of the characters...

    When i first thought about watching the Aria series I was amazed to see how many episodes overall the series has including the 2nd and 3rd season. So this made me wonder was this a series that doesn't want to die or is this show just that good that episode count doesn't matter. Well after having finished the whole series I can say that this is a slice of life series that deserves the time it takes to build the characters and make us never want to leave Neo-Venezia and the planet of Aqua. 
A quick description of the series, we are following Akari Mizunashi who decides to move from Earth to the terraformed planet of Aqua (formerly Mars) where she plans to train on becoming undine in the city of Neo-Venezia, a city of canals modeled after Venice, Italy. She is an apprentice at the Aria company, which is the small 2 person company. As the series progresses we meet many characters and learn about this incredible world of Aqua. 
Probably the biggest compliment I can pay to this series is that it makes the viewer to live in this city of canals and experience the little things in life that sometimes are taken for granted since we are moving too fast, this series slows us down and gives a relaxed view of something you've never experienced. Also the animes' director went on location to Venice to get true replicated designs of the canals and historic buildings which are replicated in Neo-Venezia. 
Akari of course is our bright-eyed rookie who is happy to be living her dream and growing up as the series moves on. The rest of the characters are good, I won't go into detail because part of the enjoyment for the show is learning each of the characters' personalities and motivations. 
Also important to note, since this is a slice of life series there is no action/battles/super powers/ etc. There is some small magical/mystery elements but that is not related to the main characters and more to do with the city of Neo-Venezia itself. So the adrenaline junkies might want to move on to something else. But this series is pure ""feel good"" from the opening song to the closing song everything is orchestrated perfectly to make you happy and at times sad that you can never go to Aqua yourself.

    Well, this is the anime what got me into anime in middle school, so I believe that I should write this review for the sake of it, Aria is amazing, from the story to the characters to the sounds and music, this one is good. 
Well I can tell you that this anime has a good story, but I won’t spoil it for you guys, it’s best to enjoy it, but I can tell you that the story has slow pacing, which for this anime is good, unlike other anime. 
Looking back at my middle school days watching this anime, I can say that the art for aria is good, I mean, these people who worked on the art for this deserve a medal because everything from the characters to The lighting is beautiful.  
Ok This part is for the recent dub that was released, the dub is better, although the voices are a little cringe for me, it’s ok, just needs a little work, like I said, I did watch the sub too, and the voices for those are good as well. 
Ok hands down my favorite character in this anime has to be aria, I mean her personality is good, the other characters like akia and Alice are good too, but that’s really all I have to say 
Well that’s my review of aria which got me into anime, to be honest, I wasn’t interested into anime until I watched aria, so it’s good that I watched it, because if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be more happy, good that a dub for this is released, now for the other seasons

    Aria the Animation 
Length: 13 Episodes 
Rating: 7.5/10 
Genre: Slice of Life, Comedy 
Plot: come and observe the life of Akari, an undine working for the Aria Company in Neo Venezia, on the planet aqua. Aqua is what&rsquo;s formerly known as Mars, after humans managed to pull up water from the surface and make the planet one that of water. Earth, known as Man-Home, has become an almost impossible place to live. 
Akari came to Aqua a year and a half ago and started working as an undine, or someone who steers gondolas. Join her as the makes new friends and learns more about Aqua. That&rsquo;s really it. It&rsquo;s the ultimate slice of life anime. There&rsquo;s no suspenseful plot, you watch it to observe the lives of those in it. 
So that you don&rsquo;t get confused by what&rsquo;s going on sometimes, I&rsquo;ll explain a bit about Aqua. 
There are four key jobs that are essential to Aqua. They are the Undines, Sylphs, Moles, and Salamanders. Undines are responsible for piloting gondolas, and there are three main companies &ndash; Aria Company, Himeya, and Orange Planet. They transport many people from place to place, and also serve a s a major source of tourist income. There are three levels to being an undine &ndash; the two apprentice levels, which are Pair and Single, and Primas, who are the professionals. You can differentiate between the ranks by the gloves on their hands &ndash; a pair has two gloves, a single one, and a prima none. It is the want of all Pairs and Singles to become a Prima, because they can then take around customers on their own and mentor other pairs and singles. 
Sylphs are the package deliverers. While there still is a &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; mail system, most of the mail is done through the sylphs, who ride around on hover-bikes transporting the goods. 
Moles and Salamanders make Aqua inhabitable however. Moles live underground, and they control the planet&rsquo;s gravity. Its very important to do so, because the strength of gravity is about 1/3 that of earth, which would make things very uncomfortable for humans to live on. Salamanders all live in the sky, in a hovering system known as Wikijima. They are responsible for controlling Aqua&rsquo;s climate, and making it habitable. The reason that they are called salamanders is that Mars&rsquo; nature by default is to be very cold &ndash; therefore, the salamanders main job is to make sure that there is enough heat in the atmosphere to survive. That being said, there are still the four traditional seasons. 
Analysis- Contrary to what you might think, its actually a good anime. When I first heard of it, I thought &lsquo;this is going to be really stupid. It&rsquo;s a show about gondolas for crying out loud.&rsquo; after being prodded by a friend, I decided to watch it. 
Whats great about this anime is that, as I said before, it truly is a slice of life anime. Its very calming to watch this and become immersed in the characters lives. The characters are instantly lovable, and each have distinct personalities just like many people in the real world have, not just the cookie cutter personalities that you find in many anime and manga. These characters are all real people. I think that that is what make this anime so great. 
My only downside to it is that it is slow paced. Because theres no plot from episode to episode, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of suspense contained there. Sometimes it was a force of will to watch them when I was bored, when I could have gone for something with a little more action. This anime you probably should watch when you&rsquo;re content with everything and you&rsquo;re not just watching anime because you&rsquo;re bored and have nothing else to do. 
Akari: She is a very loving girl, and also very innocent. She takes everything sentimentally, and feels obligated to help others at most chances. However, she is prone to panic if something starts to go wrong. She is a single for the Aria Company. 
Trademark Phrase: Ehh?? 
Aika: Heir to Himeya she takes everything seriously. She isn't one for touchy-touchy feelings, but if theres someone that she really likes, then she becomes pseudo-obsessive. She treats everything as though it were a contest, and as such mimics her instructor, Akira. She has a crush on Alicia She is a single for Himeya. 
Trademark Phrase: Hazukashi serufu kinshi! [Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!] 
Alice: A prodigy undine at Orange Planet, she is a na&iuml;ve, closed off girl. She treats everything apathetically, and first time that we see her, she doesn't know how to smile. Because she is a prodigy, she was treated differently by the girls in her school class. She is the only pair of the group, yet she is as talented. 
Trademark Phrase: adding Dekkai to everything [which means something along the lines of big, extreme, very] 
Their mentors are the Three Water Fairies, or those who are said to be the greatest undines that are currently working. 
Alicia: She is a very light natured girl, much like Akari. She loves people, and she never sees the bad side to anyone. She's best at her social skills, and as such is much wanted by the tourists. She is a prima for the Aria Company 
Trademark Phrase: Ara Ara, *giggle [Ara means My, so she's saying My My] 
Akari: Much like her apprentice, she deals with everything seriously. However, beneath it all, she's really nice &ndash; the rough exterior is her way of trying to properly train whoever is underneath her. However, even with that, she still has a mean streak, which is apparent whenever someone insults her, however jokingly she meant it. She's best at controlling the gondola out of anyone. She is a prima for Himeya. 
Trademark Phrase: Unfortunately, I can't find one. 
Athena: She is a big ditz head. She is clumsy, silent, and prone to making mistakes. However, she is remarkably perceptive, and helps usually from the shadows. She doesn't make much of an appearance, so I can't say much more. Her best skill is that of canzone, or singing [which, is quite frankly, quite amazing] 
Trademark Phrase: Again, can't find one. 
Other Characters 
Ai: A little girl from Man-Home, she became friends with Aria in the first episode, after which they became pen pals. Every episode starts off with a conversation between the two, which foreshadows/concludes the episode in some way or another. In the two episodes that she appears in person, I really don't like her. I can't really explain why though. 
Now, before you all yell at me for this next part, let me explain. On Aqua, blue eyed cats are considered to be lucky, for they embody the water goddess. Because of that, all gondola companies have a blue eyed cat as their president. 
Aria: A big, fat, Martian cat, he is my favorite character. He can understand human speech, and loves having fun. He is curious, as all cats are, and he likes to help out other people. 
Trademark Phrase: Pyun nyan nyan nya! [Ok, its basically the only thing he says. He's a cat. But i love his voice]. 
Hime: A Persian cat [I think], like her name suggests, she has a very regal manner to her [Hime means Princess in Japanese]. She is president of Himeya. 
Maa: A ... weird ... cat ... who loves to bite Aria's stomach. He is president of Orange Company. 
Music: The music in this anime is very calm, very relaxing. Something thats unique is that there is no opening sequence - rather, the song is played in the background while we watch the characters do stuff.

    Story:  The story is for people who enjoy slower pace and marvelous execution. Like Mushishi, the plot follows a protagonist on a journey, in this case to see Akari's dream of becoming an Prima Undine (gondelier). It's goal is like a treasure hunt designed to introduce us to all the special things about Neo-Venezia and the people who inhabit Aqua (Mars). Everything from the sound and character design to the art style revolves around this world. Meandering from place to place, while giving me a place to explore along with the characters and get to know the neighborhoods and people who live there.  
Art: The art for ARIA is quite wonderful. Everything really fits the mood of the story and the music and let's us see the world as the characters do. The art direction, and even some of the angles used were particularly interesting to me (such as the scene in the glass shop - it seemed like the director wanted to say that the couple wasn't seeing the whole picture, or Neo-Venezia for what it was). I was also especially impressed by how well the characters mouths are synched with the sound. Everything from the shouting to the singing is right on track (which you really don't get in many anime).  
I think the elements are what are portrayed particularly nicely - the water, the night sky, a sunset, a field... it shows just how important this world is to the people who live there. The water is essential and much of the series is dedicated to honouring it. 
Sound: Definitely a 10! The music MADE this show for me. I had the good fortune to begin watching the show very late at night and it became a kind of nightly ritual for me, because although it is still a wonderful series in the daytime, there is something so soothing and a little sleepy about the music - a very dreamy quality that makes me completely unproductive if I watched for too long. It was like watching a quiet storm from a large window or being lulled by waves. You just felt a little lethargic afterwards. I still hear it as I fall asleep or sing Athena's songs to myself. 
Characters: The characters in the show are great! You really get to know them well and they begin to feel like old friends very quickly. I thought it was interesting seeing the world through the point of view of Akari, a transplanted native, her friends, actual native, and Ai, a visitor from Manhome that Akari befriends. It made for an interesting juxtaposition of perspectives. 
My only (very slight) selfish complaint is we don't learn enough about some of their backgrounds. They are driven by behavior, so we do learn some things, but I'm nosy and love to really get to know my current series' characters well. I am never satisified until I learn what drives their behaviors. In this series, however I found that it wasn't really necessary, so I feel like I was able to know most of them adequately. Would have been nice to learn more about Al though. 
My overall enjoyment of the series was definitely Outstanding. I didn't expect to get nearly as much depth as I did or care for the characters and AQUA as I do.  
The thing that really struck me about ARIA was how much I had learned about its world once I had finished the series. I knew about people's daily lives, their background, its traditions and annual festivals. I got to know the inner workings of how some of the tourism, trades and industry and how people made their livings (including the mail service!). By the end, I even knew some of the locals by name and some of the things that were important or special to them, which is pretty rare and wonderful in a 2-demensional animated world. The world of AQUA and Aria is like a treasure that you keep warm and safe inside you, whether you spend that time alone or share it with others. 
To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated! ^_^

    Hello everyone i want to share with you my feelings about this work. 
STORY: 1/10 
I gave it a 1 out of 10.  
There's no story in this anime, so i can't rate something that does not exist. 
The point is that it's intended to be like this, the issue is that i'm not able to tollerate (yet) a concept like this. 
ART: 7/10 
The art it's fine for modern standards, if you consider this is a work of 2005 you might realize that was something beutifull back then. I watched just recently so can't really refrain from judging with modern standards.  
The animation is quite good it helps you feel the movement of the scenery, the chibi part is also likeable since every charachter has a different ""face"" that later becomes a further charachterization of them. 
Well, were to start? The opening... 
The first episodes the opening was just a fine tune, but when i started to ""Understand"" how the anime worked, it became something more, something important. 
I would easily say that the best part in the anime is the opening, watching a young lady rowing the boat in the vastness of the sea is just... perfect. 
Troughout the show the musics where on point, never stressfull tough (which is the point of the anime, it helps you to relax, not to get stressed). 
The ending is quite nice aswell, i usually skip both openings and endings but for this show i had very good reasons to not do so. 
In short the sound is just incredibly good. 
Charachters: 7/10 
The charachters are just nice, i would not say that those are good or the core of the anime ( that is the sound ), i would also not say that the charachters were an issue for this anime. They were just, nice... quite credible, but nice. Which is nice. 
Enjoyment: 6/10 
The peace of senses is what this anime is trying to achieve, 
the peace of the anime is the issue i had with it. 
The problem is, since there's no progression due to the story the peace is not ""just slow""... it's immobile.  
This is a very serious problem for a viewer that tends to become easily bored. 
What i mean with this, is that it's booring until your peace adapts to the one of the anime, in my case it happened around episodes 4 - 5. 
I realized what the anime wanted to show me and i didnt' care anymore about the progression i just watched it for the sake of watching it. 
I'm not saying i did enjoy it, it was just... not booring. 
Around episode 8 - 9 i evolved a bit more and i actually started to enjoy the little moments of happines of the charachters remembering part of my lifes while watching it. 
On episodes 10 i cryied, i felt a deep connection with a charachter and her moment of success become a moment of my success. 
Episodes 11 - 12 were very enjoyable and i felt a deep emotion every time the opening started. 
I gave it a 6/10 because the firsts episodes were just horrible slow and the moments of deep connection i had barely saves that boredom. 
Overall: 6/10. 
I want to clearly state that in the future i WILL have a different opinion about this anime. 
I'm just not mature enough to appreciate this kind of shows. 
This anime literally shows that there's no need to search happines in your life, cause it's all around you. You just have to open your eyes. 
So, why rating just a 6 out of 10?  
Like i said i'm immature, yet, and i don't think it's the best strategy in my life to just enjoy the life i've right now.  
I believe that you need to fight for your success in life and the insoddisfaction is a driving factor to change and so be more competent. 
I will put this show on hold untill i will be 40 or so years hold with a stable life and a family, i will only then understand how to be truly happy from nothing. 
(Sorry for my grammar mistakes, I'm Italian (Not from Venice tough))

    There is a thin line that Aria walks between being endearingly relaxing or mildly boring. There is little that goes on in this first season besides the odd jobs that the Aria company picks up and the daily adventures that Alice, Aika, and Akari each undines(female gondoliers) in training one day hoping to become a Prima Undine (a professional gondolier) go on. The world of Neo Venezia where they live is a peaceful and wondrous city that shares many similarities to Venice combined with a warm beach front. There isn’t many serious conflicts in the show, and very little progression to speak of, but it does fantastic show to unwind, and refresh yourself with. The show easily can put me to sleep (in a good way), with its nice and inviting atmosphere and beautiful music. The OP’s slow and galavanting pace makes the gradual vocal crescendo oh so satisfying, and the ending is just a cheery little number that leaves a smile on any viewer's face without fail. The characters are all hardworking and nice people, though a bit one dimensional so far. The repeated use of  jokes and sayings quite often like: “Embarrassing remarks are not allowed!”, “my my”, etc help to establish all the different characters and help to show off their individual personalities, and are cool for a while, and I’m glad that they never really drive any of them into the ground. I wonder why every single female undine’s name starts with an A, it can make it really difficult to remember which name goes to which face. Also the presidents being cats is a bit ridiculous though I’m not sure if they actually have any managerial duties, or are instead just figureheads or mascots for the companies. Neo Venezia is an idealized utopia, explored though these cheerful young Undines in training. If you ever felt like watching the anime realized version of Super Mario 64’s theme Dire Dire Docks on repeat, well…. here you go.

    Story- 8 
Though jarringly slow in the beginning, the story plays off as a charming stroll in the park with a friend: Pleasant, fun, somewhat exciting, yet also a little anachronistic and forgetable. The story seems to fit in with lighter fare comparable to that of Someday's Dreamers, but it does pick up and adds an interesting sci-fi twist to the world the characters reside. And though the stories have a little trouble flowing from episode to episode, the fluffy narration helps guide the viewer to the themes of both the individual episode and the overall series. 
Animation- 8 
The art style is plain, but crisp, effervescent, and expressive. The direction very decisively uses wonderful pans and panoramas to give a unique sense of scope to Aqua. The water glitters with radiance, and there is a milky smoothness to the gondaliers' rowing. The animators clearly took time in their attempt to recreate Venice, and successfuly integrated futuristic technology by giving it a more rustic look. 
Characters- 8 
Though some of the characters are standard archetypes in anime, their interactions give them a distinct sense of depth.  
Sound- 9 
I thnk that this is the strongest component of the show. The score to Aria the Animation has a wonderful authentic Italian feel to it. The opening and ending themes are deliberate and flow easily into and out of the show. The voice actors are very expressive and compliment the gentle tone of the series. Finally the insert songs sung by Athena wonderfully contribute to the Venitian atmosphere. 
Enjoyment- 8 
Again, the inherent charm of the story and visuals captivates the viewer. 
Overall- 8 
While I rather enjoyed watching the series as a whole, this particular show suffered a little bit from having to introduce so many things of such importance to the series that it suffered a little. I was quite jarred by the slow pace of the series initiated in the first episode, but these flaws are also some of its strengths. Its a series like no other and I applaud it for maintaining that choice. Everyone should watch this series if only for Aria the Origination which excelled at nearly everything the series tries to accomplish while having to balance emotional investments in characters. And Alice is one of my favorite characters!

    After rewatching the Aria, I've decided it's definately personally my favourite SoL series. I hope this review will help you decide wether Aria will be sometihng for you or not. 
Story? Not rated, if you want to see sometihng with a deep and profound story, atleast the first two seasons are probably not what you're after. Reasons why you may be interested though are: a desire relax and lose stress. Seeing little wonders or amazing things. Aria is basically a feel good anime. 
Aria is mostly about Akari, a girl from Manhome (24th century earth) going by herself to Aqua (terraformed Mars which is now mostly covered by water). By the first episode she's already been there for almost a year. So there's no ""settling in"" and the ""story"" can start right away without any delay. Akari is training to become an undine (it's not important what an undine is, but it's basically someone rowing a gondola for tourism purposes). You don't see her overcoming all kinds of obstacles because that's not what the anime is about. Instead you see parts of her life and her adventures (with her friends) in the days passing by as she's trying to become a professional. 
The art is pretty good. There's not much to be said about this. The scenery is gorgeous. Eventhough the anime is (currently) not available in any kind of resolution near HD what you see is still amazing. There is some chibi/exaggerated facial expersions stuff going on in the series (mostly when depicting people their quirks and traits), but if you don't mind it too much it should be fine. 
The sound is absolutely amazing. I like pretty much all voice actors (I don't really like Alice's VA but other than that I have no complaints. The music fits perfectly. I personally think Aria has the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I don't like a cappella for example, but I can't help but appriciate it when it plays. Most of the songs are soothing, calming and cheery fitting the general scenery and mood of the anime. 
The characters are all unique within the anime. Every person showing up has a strongly distinct personality. Though sometimes certain traits seem a bit exaggerated, their acts and decisions are all very human. Nothing seems out of place in this aspect. The diverse cast I think can make you appriciate Aria even if you don't absolutely love Akari. Characters other than Akari also get plenty of screen time. 
I also like the structure of the anime. It usually starts with a short introduction of the episode, which naturally flows into the opening (the OP gets different scenery every episode which has been made to fit the mood/story of the episode). By the time the OP fades out the it has naturally flown into the main body of the episode. It's a bit hard to explain, but if you decide to watch Aria you'll know what I mean. 
The first time I watched Aria, I did it within about 2 weeks. I really enjoyed it a lot. However after hearing multiple people saying that watching it slowly would be better I decided to rewatch the whole series 1 episode a day (before going to sleep). That is when I found out the soundtrack wasn't just very good, it was in fact, amazing. It also made me appriciate every episode more. 
I rated everything a 9, because I do think that Aria isn't perfect. But the small imperfections don't really matter to me as it gets compensated by being amazing as a whole. 
To me there's no real difference between in setup or quality within the series. So what I wrote will apply to all 3 (currently finished) seasons. 
If you're reading this there's a good chance you're interested and didn't stop reading after the first few lines. I know I wrote amazing a lot. I did it because it amazes me how much I like Aria. I guess I could have written ""wonderful"" (suteki) instead to make it look more like Akari's point of view. You'll find out what I mean by that if you'll watch the series.

    I will be straight and honest now in the beginning when writing this review in my heart i would call this a masterpiece in some ways because of all it gives the one who watches it but the problem is if i just gave it a 10 i would feel like that would be too little critical of it so i will try to give it as good and calm as i can.  
First of all the story. Again this is a part i will have problem with staying objective because if there is a city i love it has to be venice and when i found an anime that created a perfect new venice i couldnt help but love it. It has parts of being supernatural in it but it stays true to what it is about. Aqua and the beautiful world of new venecia. It gives you a feeling of wanting more no matter how far you get in it and it can bring you to a sleepy state of dreams there you are trapped into the anime and cant help but to float with it and follow the story as they tell you everything there is about this new planet aqua and its city new venecia. Granted if i want to be more objective i will honestly say that this might feel very slow for some who watches it i will be honest there but for those who appreciate a story telling through and anime like this its capturing.  
Again art isnt what im good at but for me it was a nice fit for the anime with a good original feel to it. 
The sound was another thing that gave the story life of its own. Granted it might make you sleeping and relaxed too much which might be a bad thing but it also throws you into a sleeping feel there you just want to listen to the soundtrack as the anime floats by.  
Every character has something to offer they tell the story of each of the more central characters in its own time. Though Akari will stay a mystery in a way you will still love the characters with their own personal beliefs and stories. Again this anime follow what some might call my pace but that is something i hope those who watch this anime will realise and enjoy to the fullest. ' 
There was never a moment that i didnt enjoy this anime but there was always a moment there i just wanted more and more because this world felt so vast eventhough its mostly just in the area of neo venecia. There were times i even shed a tear or two because the feels you get from the characters story and music can wring your heart yet give you a laugh or two.  
So overall i want to call it a masterpiece eventhough an objective side of me is trying to tell me otherwise i cant really help but loving every part of this great anime.  10/10 Because beautiful and calm anime like this is the rarest out there and this captures that.

    Aria the Animation is a series of beautifully gentle science fiction tales - some are whimsical, some are strange, some are mystical and none are scary - combined with the most consistently spectacular art I've ever seen; and the music is right behind it. If you are a male under 25 years of age odds are you won't like Aria the Animation. If, on the other hand, you like sitting on a pier on a beautiful day and watching the world go by you'll probably love it. 
The central character is Akari who has come to the water world of Aqua to be an apprenticed gondolier to the Aria Company of New Venice, the planets major city. In each episode she discovers a person, place or a time presented to her and the viewer as a simple treasure on her adopted planet. 
(I'm going to reference the Minami sisters if you haven't seen the series, I recommend you do as a warm up before watching Aria.) 
If Akari was a Minami sister she would be between Haruka and Kana. The reason I mention the Minami's is that that the three other major characters are, indeed, the Minami sisters minus most of the gags: Alicia (Haruka) who is the lead gondolier of the Aria Company; the gentle, wise, patient mother figure; Aika (Hana), Akari's best friend, apprenticed to the Hime Company is the broad comic character,she insists that she must the best in everything and keeps telling Akari she should be much more serious; and finally Alice (Chiaki) is the character constantly bemused by the others, apprenticed to Orange Planet Company, she's a prodigy, several years younger than her two friends and serious beyond her years. 
Of the 13 episodes about half were wonderful to watch and about half were very good, there was one that was too talky and too static, although still beautiful to look at. Aria the Animation is kind of like a basket of beautiful, delicious fruit - only have a piece or two (maybe three) at time, don't attempt to consume the entire basket at once, take a moment to appreciate each for what it is and savor it.

    I like Mushishi. I like Hetalia. I like Fruits Basket. 
I don't like Aria the Animation!  
Just to make one thing perfectly clear, I'm not above of SoL-shows or even a shows that have no over-branching story to give! As long as the premise and the characters are enjoyable, I can pretty much swallow any kind of SoL-experiences there is... mostly! When I was adviced to pick the Aria up, I was spectical, yes, but still optimistic enough to give it atry, and after the experience that I would describe at best as a ""4 hour nap-time"", I'm greatly dissapointed! 
First of, what is good? Or ""good"", if you will. Well... the art is decent, often times quite pretty, actually! The Aqua as a location is pretty to look at, but not very innovative nor interesting to look at. I mean... when you have a Mars turned into ""secon Earth"", there should be imo something much more interesting to invest into, than snowflies and bizarre cats for crying out loud! The sounds of the characters are really mellow and soft - read; I hate them! - but the music is really beautiful, expecially the opening songs and endings, with their lovely animations - I just adore those ""brush-painted"" endings so much! Is there anything else to praise about? 
Well... not really. 
The story is really bare-boned, shallow, and completely lacking any kind of conflict, or suspence. Which is to be expected, I quess, when the story revolves around these three clones... I mean ""truly individual and/or unique"" girls, dreaming to someday ""row, row, row the boat, gently down the canal of this not-at-all-copy-pasted-image-of-an-Venice-that-comes-to-mind-to-every-japanese-animator-that-hear-the-word-of-condola-and-ask-if-it's-some-kind-of-musical-instrument"", because apparently, the profession of the condoliers is in this world pretty much at the same level, as the supermodels and popstars... before they hit the meth. 
The show is very linear - despite it taking a place in a city, that's covered in water! - and can often times feel either quite draggy, or rushed, which is very easy to pin-point on the fact that it's a short show. I for one refuce to accept that as an excuse! I know, that if the story is good, the amount of episodes has nothing to do with it! The story told in under a 13-episodes can be amazing, if the story is good, just as the show with 50-episodes or more can be jut as afwul, if the story is bad! Aria the Animation has a bad story, and no amount of episoded couldn't have saved it from it's predicament.  
Okay, so, the story didn't obviously win me over. So, how about the characters then? 
What characters?! There are none!  
Atleast... not anyone that I would whole-heartedly think of as a character! They're all the same - you're typical ""nice-girls"" with their sweet expressions and ""cute"" quirks, with no actual dilemmas, or flaws to speak of. They all even have the exact same goals, and what ever little personality they all have, leaves them just bland, boring, and one-dimensional. The humor is also really dry, and wears off really quickly, but it's actually not that visible, so my brain was pretty save from that one.  
But let me swear... if I hear that ""my, my, my"" even one more time I'll...! 
That being said... did I hate it? 
Not really! 
It's mellow and soft atmosphere was actually quite pleasant, and a nice breather from my more common, action-oriented and plot-heavy shows with multi-dimensional characters, that I seem to favor over more light-hearted shows. 
That being said, I wouldn't watch it agains, since it didn't have that same SoL-hook, that so many other shows tend to have over me. It doesn't invite me to come back and pick it up againd, which leaves me quite cold towards it. 
But, would I still recommend this? 
Sure... if you happen to ride condola for a living! 
No, seriously! 
I would recommend Aria the Animation for those, who like mellow atmosphere, aren't really into action or heavy plots, and just want something relaxing and comforting to watch, without any conflicts, drama, or villains. Those who enjoy their animes with a little bit more content, and more fleshed-out characters, this is a easy skip! 
I can only hope, that the Natural is better than this, because I really wanted to like Aria! Sadly, this isn't an promising start. 
""My, my, my!"" 
Aaaargh!!!

    Aria the Animation, a work that provokes mixed feelings. I was tempted to watch this show after being recommended to it by this site and after reading the reviews. I though I had found a show worth watching, but Aria was more like watching an overly corny reality show. Here´s my reasoning. 
I watch anime in order to enjoy many things, the art, the music, the characters and most importantly, the story. Aria has all the previous, except a well-defined story. Now, slices of life are normal for this, but many use comedy to fill in the holes. Aria just wants to you to feel al warm and fuzzy, that is unacceptable for me. I want to feel something, be it laughter, sadness, anger or any emotion. Aria just tries to keep me relaxed with its stereotypical characters: the clumsy and kind-hearted protagonist, the equally kind-hearted tomboy and the silent, sweet girl that serves as an observer between these two. 
In terms of character development I saw none, regardless of what situations they´re put through, they remained the same throughout the entire show. Now, that is not a bad thing, slices of life tend to be a bit more difficult than your average story, since they try to portray the happenings of everyday life. 
I felt no strong feelings towards the music (one of the most important things I note in any audio-visual work), and in this Aria excellls. It doesn't want me to feel any strong emotion, it just wants me to smoke a blunt or drink some coffee and relax. 
Aria achieves its goal greatly: for you to feel nothing and just watch the everyday life of an unremarkable trio of girls. Perhaps that is one reason why it has such good reviews. 
Unfortunately I don´t watch anime to experience the same kind of morbid reactions most reality viewers enjoy. I watch it for the stories, the scares, the action, (God forbid) even romance, but not for the sake of watching it. That´s why Aria scores less than average in my book. 
If you want to experience reallity anime, this might be the first, or at least the most known of its kind. If that´s the case, by all means, you might even enjoy it, but if you want to feel something, you are better off going somewhere like I did. 
At the time of this review, the reviewer has dropped Aria the Natural at episode 6.

    I absolutely LOVED THIS SHOW! ~  This is a feel good anime with funny, unique characters.  You can sit and watch the whole show in one sitting.  It is one of my favorite shows and I can watch it again and again.  This was the first anime I ever cried to, and still love the feel and atmosphere given from it.  You will love it so download, sit-down, and enjoy this loving, fun, calm, and brilliant story of Aqua in the future, a dream that is waiting to begin.

    (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site) 
[Synopsis]: In the city of Neo-Venezia on the planet Aqua, once known as Mars before being terraformed, Mizunashi Akari (Hazuki, Erino) works as an Undine under the Aria Company – a professional gondolier who ferries the citizens of Neo-Venezia as well as tourists through the city’s many waterways. Though only a fledgling Undine, Akari and her friends Aika (Saito, Chiwa) and Alice (Hirohashi, Ryou) have high aspirations of one day becoming as accomplished as their respective teachers, known as the Three Water Fairies of Neo-Venezia. Aria follows Akari and her friend’s progress as Undines and their heartfelt interactions with the people of Aqua. 
[Characters]: 
Mizunashi Akari, the protagonist of the show, through her characterization sets the tone for Aria quite well. She’s highly optimistic, friendly, and cheerful all of which go closely hand-in-hand with attitude of the show. Her ability to find joy in the mundane speaks most chiefly to one of Aria’s primary messages as well as the show’s laid back, slice of life nature. Akari’s correspondence with her friend Ai back on Manhome, previously known as Earth, serves as a useful framework to deliver thematic sentiments at the beginning and end of each episode as well as allow the show to clue in the viewer to certain jargon and in-world terms such as Sylphs, Gnomes, and Salamanders without addressing them directly, allowing the information to present itself naturally within the dialogue of the show. Akari’s sentimental and caring nature makes her the perfect character with which to explore the world of Aqua as her own personality and thoughts reflect so closely to what the show tries to accomplish. 
Granzchesta Aika, an Undine employed under the Himeya company and Akari’s close friend, serves a few purposes within the show. Her catchphrases and sharp remarks are the source of a good deal of the show’s comedy as well as Akari’s comical reactions. Additionally, Aika, similar to Alice, is perhaps the more passionate of the three in regards to her job as an Undine – though they all aspire to one day be like their teachers, Aika vocally strives to be the best Undine possible though her work ethic and overall attitude may not reflect this trait. As opposed to Akari she felt somewhat under-investigated as as character with only a handful of notable traits and so I can only imagine she will be fleshed out in the future. 
The last of the main trio of apprentice Undines is Carroll Alice. Though she starts with a slight complication concerning her attitude I found that it was dismissed incredibly quickly rather than serving as a source of development for her and while I enjoyed Alice is a character more than most others, I felt that this aspect of her character was mishandled. Despite liking the character as much as I did, I felt she too was a little under-explored and while complex characters are not a necessity within a slice of life setting, due to the calm and relaxed nature of Aria, these elements would help keep ones attention all the better. 
One of the important things concerning the characters that I think the show did well was in how it portrayed the relationship between the three apprenticed Undines and their mentors. The three main characters very straightforwardly mirror their seniors however I liked the fact that each characters personality felt influenced in some way by their teacher. This made the relationships feel more genuine and moreover, the fact that they were not perfect copies of each other helped reinforce their individuality as characters. 
[Art/Animation]: 
The animation felt fairly par for the course and while it was not flashy in its presentation it was not lacking either. The true success within this section stems from the show’s setting which was executed fantastically. The setting of a Venetian city on a distant planet is presented excellently and while the city itself does not feel extensively explored, the colors and serene atmosphere of the city support the tone of the show wonderfully. Furthermore, the countryside settings lined with wind turbines and the intermittent tree-covered mountaintops add diversity to the water-dominant environment but also display a great marriage between the show’s anachronistic setting and its sci-fi premise in an aesthetically pleasing way. The art of the show is certainly a point of triumph for Aria. 
[Story]: 
As Aria The Animation is one of the premiere slice of life shows, the story is both laid back in demeanor and episodic in nature. The events of each episode succeed in presenting a relaxing mood through the interactions between Akari, her friends, and the people of Aqua and while there are the occasional obstacles and problems that arise they are resolved by the end of the episode and punctuated by tooth-achingly sweet, optimistic observation that closes out the theme of what transpired. 
As the characters and the world serve as the two primary points of interest in the show due to its reliance on them rather over a more traditional story I was surprised how little the city felt fleshed out and how underrepresented its populace was. The city setting is portrayed fantastically and the bustling of the crowds and of people nearby is ever present within the background of the show however its main characters only actually interact with a small handful of people throughout the 13 episodes which somewhat contradicts the show’s premise and best interest. The city itself was featured in an aesthetic way on plenty of levels however I feel that the inclusion of more people would have gone a long way in presenting a slightly more  lively and believable atmosphere. For this reason, it felt to me like Aria The Animation is mostly a source of groundwork being laid for future exchanges and interactions while harboring a somewhat wanting number of these things within itself. That being said, the exchanges that do take place are sincere and heartwarming and I think the show has great potential in this regard to both develop its characters and create more meaningful interactions between them. 
[Music]: 
When I think about the music of Aria I am reminded of how the art of the show supported it as I think a very similar thing takes place in this category. The music, while not necessarily iconic, blends together with the aesthetic and tone of the show in amazing ways and while no individual song sticks out in my mind, the effect of the music on the show was one of the more memorable elements of Aria. 
[Final Thoughts and Rating]:  
Aria The Animation was a show with a decent number of triumphs concerning its overall presentation and attempted tone however a fair number of shortcomings in the form of lack of characterization and a more extensive cast. The show is certainly worth a watch and while the show may not be amazing it certainly lays a good groundwork for what could become an even more interesting setting with a larger and more in-depth cast. 
Rating: 6 
I gave Aria The Animation a 6 because it was overall a decent show however it was significantly held back in a variety of ways mostly in relation to its entertainment value. Because of the slow and serene tone of the show I will look next to the characters in order to compensate for the slice of life elements of the show in order to keep my attention and make me invested in the events of each episode however as the cast is relatively small and the main characters with the exception of Akari lacking significantly in character depth and traits my attention falters and I am left with a great atmosphere wherein nothing of real note or concern takes place. The pros outweigh the cons here and the atmosphere of the show really is executed beautifully but these lackluster elements hold the show back from climbing any higher. 
[Recommendations]: 
Aria The Animation is slice of life at its most pure and for this reason I would highly recommend it to any fans of the genre as it does a great job in many regards. At the same time, the show somewhat requires of the viewer very much what it preaches over several episodes – that one must be capable of finding enjoyment in the mundane. Other slice of life shows will often bolster their content with either comedy or certain other story elements and while these things are present in small doses in Aria it is most primarily concerned with the somewhat trivial events that take place and in this way demand a little extra from the viewer. The comedy of the show is highly reliant on the catchphrase interactions between the main characters however there are a handful of stand alone jokes though I would not recommend Aria as a comedy to someone anything less than enthralled with the other elements of the show to begin with. One final thing I will say is that the world of Aria is an interesting one that speaks to both fantasy and sci-fi simultaneously though, like the comedy of the show, I would not recommend it solely for these reasons as they are not the central point of the show even though their execution is quite great.

    This will be the first of my series of reviews for the ARIA animes. My perspective on these reviews will be based on how I felt after finishing the season my first time. 
ARIA the ANIMATION is the first season of the series adapted from Kozue Amano's AQUA and ARIA manga series. I will say right off the bat that this is not an anime for everyone, for those who cannot stand slow paced, happy and calm slice of life shows this anime IS NOT for you and should turn around now :P 
Story: In the year 2301, Mars has been terraformed into a water planet and renamed Aqua. Neo Venezia, an exact replica of the old city of Venice, was build on Aqua. It is there where Mizunashi Akari, a girl that has come from Man-home (formerly called Earth), has arrived in hopes of becoming one of Neo-Venezia's trademark female gondoliers called undines. As a slice of life anime, there is not much of a real ongoing plot going as most of the episodes consists of the day to day life of Akari as she trains under Aria Company with her friends in order to become a full fledged undine. Regardless, each individual episode has a certain charm to it that draws you into the world of Aqua, so its not so bad. 
Art: As far as the character art goes, it is nothing incredible, but it is consistent and well animated. The real charm in ARIA's graphics are in the backgrounds and landscapes which resemble the real Venice with incredible accuracy. The sky, the oceans, and the city looks beautiful in this anime and is a real treat to watch. 
Sound: This is without a doubt the best aspect of this show, the various instrumental and vocal songs in this show really makes you lose yourself in the world of ARIA and are just very enjoyable to listen to. Some of these songs are so relaxing you might find yourself slowly drift into drowsiness sometimes when watching this show. 
Character: Another great aspect of this show are the characters, the six main undines we are introduced all have their own distinctive personalities and they all interact so well with each other that just watching them talk about everyday events is very entertaining to watch. I would describe ach character to you but its better to just experience them yourself to fully enjoy it. 
Enjoyment: I'm surprised I managed to watch such a slow paced show yet not feel like I wasted my time. I was on the verge of falling asleep various times watching this yet I did not hate it. There is a certain charm in this show that kept making me come back to it. And im glad i did. 
Overall: This is a very good show, however if you decide to watch it I recommend that you DONT marathon this 4-5 episodes at a time. This is an anime meant to be enjoyed at a slower pace over a longer period of time. Watching this show felt like going a tour around a city that both fictional and real. It was a very calming experience and i can definitely say I enjoyed watching it.

    Antithesis of the exciting effects of coffee, ""Aria"" is an anime that leads us to a peaceful dream without ever closing our eyes, tightened in the desire to be us also inhabitants of the wonderful Neo Venice and have the chance to take a few turns on a gondola, very different from those of our, although real, rather decadent (without any offense) city on the sea. 
We are in the year 2301, or about 150 years from the terraforming of Mars. While the Earth has been given the new name of Man-home, the red planet is now known as ""Aqua"" and hosts, among other attractions, the city of Neo-Venice, or the perfect reconstruction of the Venetian capital now submerged by the waters . It is here that the adventures of our protagonist Akari Mizunashi take place, which is committed to becoming, one day, an expert Order. 
Like the following ones, the first series of ""Aria"" perfectly shows that weaving tragic or spectacular plots is not strictly necessary to hit and excite the spectator. A dreamy and relaxed atmosphere, the magic of everyday life and extreme simplicity are the elements that are the masters in this wonderful work and that make it a product of all respect. 
 Another essential element of the work are the sentences and thoughts of his characters, in particular of his protagonist: they are expressed with the most genuine naturalness and come directly from the heart. In the contemplation of a place or an extraordinary event, our Akari cannot help but let itself go to simple comparisons, far from complex and sought-after scripts, and similar to poems that only children would be able to compose and that adults would never have the courage to write. The occasional sickness that could derive from it, then, is wisely damped by Aika's torment ""Forbid embarrassing sentences"". 
First of all, it is often pointed out how the world in which our protagonists live is an ""extraordinary miracle"": the planet Aqua, in fact, is the product of the hard work of human beings who have worked together to offer people a place pleasant and comfortable to live in. If the following series are more dedicated to exploring the streets and canals of Neo-Venice, in ""The Animation"" we often move outside the city and travel between suggestive spas, bucolic landscapes and white sand beaches. On each of these occasions, Akari cannot fail to contemplate the wonderful world that was given to her, and she will not fail to thank the people who created her and those who continue to make her existence possible. 
 As for the adjective ""extraordinary"" I used previously, it should be pointed out that in most cases it is synonymous with ""ordinary"". Obviously it sounds like a strong contradiction, but one of the prerogatives of ""Aria"" is precisely the absence of sudden developments and striking twists. An expression that in this work would fit perfectly is, in fact, ""Happiness is in the small things"": every episode is an invitation to rejoice, to be moved, to be moved by everything that surrounds us and by the small events of each day. 
Moving on to the characters, there is no need to dwell much. These thirteen episodes have essentially served to introduce and give us a general smattering of protagonists and supporting actors, while for a more in-depth characterization we will have to wait for the following seasons. At first glance, however, they are all very nice, each with its typical interlayer and the distinctive super-deformed face (the latter, perhaps, a little too much used). 
 The sound sector is characterized by an excellent soundtrack. After the opening theme that directly touches the heart of the viewer (able to give even a few thrills on certain occasions) we move on to the tracks, governed by the Italian popular musical instruments and perfectly remembering the Victorian atmospheres of the real Venice, enveloping the spectator more and more with its magic. Everything is never invasive and always remains a delicate outline. To finish it all, the closing theme is taken care of, more musical and sought after in rhythms than the others but always a light and pleasant song.

    Feeling a little melancholy? Had a rough day at work? C- on that last history exam? If so, Doctor Penguin recommends a good dose of Aria the Animation to cheer you up. This delightful slice-of-life story is sure to have you smiling again as you follow along the training of three young undines (gondoliers) on the newly terraformed planet, Aqua (Mars). Known for its sleepy pace, serene settings, and whimsical nature, it is sure to delight any slice-of-life fan. Fans that require more story driven shows or action sequences will obviously want to avoid this one. On to the breakdown!  
Story: 5/10 - Slice-of-life shows certainly aren't usually known for their complex plots and storytelling. Aria is no exception to the rule. In fact, it probably contains the simplest plot out of any show I've seen. The show is episodic in nature, with each storyline propelling the characters toward a new life lesson. I enjoyed that the writers for the show avoided overly sentimental or sappy story lines for the most part. They kept the same lightheartedness atmosphere consistent through the entire series. I still have to give it a low score though, because like I said, there's not much story to be found. 
Art: 7/10 - The art style works well for the anime. The artists use lots of bright vivid colors to reinforce the cheerful atmosphere. Their recreation of Venice was competently done, but I think they missed out a little on a chance to really make the settings spectacular. Character designs were fairly traditional, but they worked. The only oddity in the show was the design of President Aria, the mascot for the Aria company. What the hell was up with that cat? 
Sound: 7/10 - The voice actors (I watched the Japanese version) were average. No one performance stuck out as incredible or awful. The soundtrack fit well with the animation, but isn't something I'd listen to as a standalone.  
Character: 7/10 - The characters above all were very likeable. That's probably the most important aspect of a slice-of-life series. I found myself emotionally connected to them throughout the story, which is very crucial for my only personal enjoyment. If I were to be more critical each character in the show is a little underdeveloped.  I would have liked to have seen a little more back story for the main characters. At only 13 episodes, with each of those having very little plot, it's an understandable problem though. The only other thing I can say about the characters were that a few were a bit too idyllic. A few flaws always helps make a character more believable. 
Enjoyment: 9/10 -  On to the intangibles... How is it that everything else gets rated 7 or below, and this receives a 9? I really don't know. It just made me really happy as I was watching it.  
Overall: 8/10

    Aria is Italian and in English it means air, looks, and expression. I'd like to translate it myself as, atmosphere. Atmosphere, yes, because this is the main thing that Aria sells. 
First, 
Let me tell you upfront, aria is NOT for you who is a die-hard fans of action, tension, thrill, and suspense. 
Second, 
Again, read the first. 
I'm telling you guys this because Aria has none of them. Like i said before, Aria sells the atmosphere.  
Aria tells the story of Mizunashi Akari and her adventure becoming a Prima Undine. Almost every ecounter, conflicts, and adventure is meant not to amaze you, but to make you realize how important small things are, and relaxes you at the same time. 
The visualization of Neo-Venezia(Yes, Neo, because the real Venezia is sunk here.) is very sublime, so imaginably fitting with the sci-fi concepts that Kozue Amano presents. 
The great visualization is accompanied with amazing scoring and sound tracks. As i'm writing this, the ending song of Aria, Rainbow, is playing in my head. 
The opening song, ""Undine"", is very hypnotizing, hits me in the very heart of mine. I dare you, when you hear ""Undine"" you will think of Neo-Venezia and it's beauty. 
Not that this series is perfect, i almost fell asleep too many times watching this, which is not a good thing, but hey, i fell asleep not because it was boring, but because it's ""Aria"", which makes it a good thing on the other hand. 
Watch this with your heart wide open and feel the magic of Neo-Venezia, and then you'll see small things around you differently and appreciate them more.

    ""Lots of things change with the flow of time. But there are things that never change. Things that are precious because they change, and things that are precious because they don’t change… Both are precious. Don’t you feel the same?"" 
I watch anime to enjoy myself. Every fan does. I have horrible days, awesome ones, but always after, I find myself opening up my Laptop and watching some good ol’ anime. You see, there’s a special charm to the medium. A unique aspect that distinguishes it above all the rest. Whether it be its exclusiveness to its respective origin country, or just the shows in general that can only be made from the minds of the Japanese, I always find myself appreciating the wonderful world that anime has given me. I haven’t watched enough shows for my opinion to matter, if I’m being completely honest, due to time constraints and a filled-up schedule but whenever I come across an anime that I love, I obsess over it for days, weeks, even months. With this obsession comes my desire to write a review that expresses my thoughts and why I cherish the said anime with all my heart. And it seems Aria the Animation is one of the few that have rekindled this feeling. 
Enter the beautiful world of Neo Venezia, the city of a now-populated, man-made planet named Aqua, which to no surprise to its name, is filled mostly with water. A Utopian wonderland filled with the bustling life of citizens and tourists alike, Neo Venezia is also the setting of which we meet our main protagonist for the first time, Mizunashi, Akari. Akari is a bright and cheerful girl, always optimistic in the face of conflict. Due to her positive mindset in life, she is constantly greeted with many characters who all come to be drawn into Akari’s liveliness. Among them are Aika and Alice, two other trainees who share the same goal as Akari. To not just be a Prima, but to also surpass their seniors. In the show, Prima’s are basically tour guides who introduce newcomers to the wonderful city of Neo Venezia in their gondolas. In reality, Neo Venezia could very well be Venice, located in Italy, with most of its area being filled with water and the presence of gondolas being felt everywhere. Think of Neo Venezia as the future of Venice. 
Through Akari and her friends’ desires, they come across many kinds of obstacles but always overcome them in one way or another. They help each other as friends should and trud through it all no matter how tough the going gets. Yet, the problem that matters most is not about achieving their goal and becoming a Prima, it’s when their expedition ends and they are forced to part ways due to the fact they’re all in their respective rival companies. An internal conflict that lingers in the mind. What happens when they become Primas? Will they be able to maintain their friendship? Will reaching their destination bring more hardships? Questions like these are addressed in the anime in a way that stirs up drama genuinely, not with any half-assed melodramatic exaggeration and tons of crying, but with actual sincere emotion that is believable and convincing. 
Each episode begins with an opening monologue that leads to the pleasant and calming Opening, Undine, a song so beautiful, you could end up trying to sing along with it (at least that’s what I did). Each episode is devoted to fulfilling its role as individual short stories, every detail matters and every bit of character interaction helps in developing the characters, making them realistic and authentic. The main appeal from Aria the Animation lies in its overall message. Every episode contains a neat little adventure that almost always gives us a reason to appreciate whatever we have in life. Not just that, but the Ending song perfectly wraps the story without leaving any bitter aftertaste. Aria is not merely just an (extremely) well-done Slice-of-Life. It’s an entire experience. The city of Neo Venezia is brought to life with the help of Akari and her friends. Every character has a purpose, each and every one of them all have one unique facet to their personality that is needed for the show to thrive. It is solely dependent on its characters, and while each individual story that Aria carries around with it is certainly intriguing and required some actual thought, it’s the characters that bring this anime to the pedestal that it is now standing at. They are the reason the community praises the Aria franchise to be the truest to the Slife-of-Life genre. That is the core of Aria.  
Unlike many other SoL’s, it does not rely on any sub-genres or anything exciting for that matter. There is nothing spectacular, nothing that makes you leap off of your couch. Due to this, when reading the premise of Aria, the show can come off as “lackluster” or “uneventful”. It’s common to think that there isn’t anything really special about Aria, that it’s wholly plain and not worth your time. But if you’re willing to embrace this show for what it is, for what it wants to offer us, the audience, that’s when you can fully understand why it’s repeatedly regarded as the best SoL to exist. Period. In Aria the Animation, you come to appreciate the little details, the tiny things that may have just been forgotten, all these little aspects that surround the anime are all connected and realised in some way. It persuades us to appreciate life, OUR lives, for what it is and what it could be. Aria inspires us to be able to reach for what we initially thought was impossible. And that was what drew me into embracing Aria and fully loving what it’s all about. I’ll be honest. It does take a while, I admit the first few episodes seem like a slow trip, you might even want to stop watching as it doesn’t look like it’ll go anywhere, but trust me. You’re about to be in for a sweet ride. The show takes its time and it does so for good reason. Every episode matters, no matter how unimportant it may seem while watching, as the show begins to come to an end, everything will fall into place and you’ll come to realise that every single element ties itself together forming a united whole. 
And that’s not all. Aria doesn’t just give us compelling and wonderful characters, it goes above and beyond with its animation and soundtrack. Aria the Animation makes good use of its animation and despite it being old and outdated, it still accomplishes its purpose. Every beautiful scene is dazzling and alluring, showing that even an anime that's more than ten years old can still hold up against shows such as Violet Evergarden and Koe no Katachi, known for its beautiful exterior. The same can be said about the anime’s music and sound design. The songs are attractive and easy to listen to. The sound is the backbone that supports the show and brings the emotions to its full scope. Consisting of piano melodies and string instruments, each minute of music causes Aria to be 5 times as elegant as it already is. 
Aria the Animation is an overall endearing, soothing ride that casts a net of serenity on the viewer, utilizing its animation to its full extent and incorporating a soundtrack that can only be described as perfect, with a graceful Opening and a lovely Ending that surround the show. Because of its calming nature, there’s a certain way of watching the anime for you to fully enjoy it. First, take a shower, grab a cup of coffee, and press play on your Laptop. There needs to be no distraction. Nothing else needs to be in your mind. With that, you can truly acknowledge this masterpiece. I can understand why it might be easy to dismiss Aria completely. Some people just can’t get into it no matter how much they’re persuaded. Others just don’t like Slice-of-Life. Every person’s taste is different. Anime, like all other mediums, is subjective. It’s art that can be interpreted in many ways. But if you’re a fairly new anime fan or just someone who wants to get into the genre of Slice-of-Life, then Aria the Animation is the perfect introductory piece. This anime will remain as one of my all-time favorites and I’m eager to watch the two next seasons of the franchise. To put it simply, Aria the Animation is gorgeous.

    “Have you heard this story before? When a certain traveler left on a journey in search of what he desired, he was told by his teacher: “You mustn’t lose your way, because if you make one wrong turn – you will never find what you were searching for”. But, unfortunately, the traveler lost his way and hung his head in dismay… But when he raised his head again, what he saw before him was a world even more magnificent than what the traveler was searching for. It means if you don’t make mistakes, there are things you won’t discover.” – Alicia Florence 
Aria is a utopian science fantasy manga by Kozue Amano. The series received an anime adaptation in 2005, second anime adaptation in 2006, an OVA released in 2007, and a 3rd season in 2008. A new OVA, called Aria the Avvenire, was released in 2016. 
Aqua is a fictional planet that has many things to offer for its visitors. For example, the water city Neo Venezia. It is popular because of the city’s guides, who are called Undines, who are also professional gondoliers. Akari Mizunashi is a gondolier in training and also an employee of one of the companies in Neo Venezia, where you can book an excursion and your guide will be one of the famous Undines. Akari meets new people and unveils the secrets of Aqua.  
What makes Aria that great is its simplicity. Not that it does not have a hidden meaning, or things for you to analyze, the series has a great number of episodes that are packed with many heartwarming and sometimes dramatic events. Aria is a masterpiece simply because of the fact that its main genre is SoL, but it is never boring to watch. Aria offers its viewer a fictional story that might as well become a reality in the future. For that very reason, it is that breathtaking to watch. As every SoL series, it has no action scenes, but what makes this series that amazing is its beauty. And Aria is amazingly beautiful: its world building, its characters; Aria is a series that every fan of the SoL genre has to experience.  
Animation wise, it is an open secret that the series aired long time ago and you might find the animation of the first season somewhat…lacking. But that should not worry you, since the 2nd, 3rd seasons, as well as the OVAs have a much better animation than in the 1st season.  
Sound wise, Aria has a great OST that is very relaxing to listen to. Not only the OST, but also the voice actors in Aria are top notch. Thanks to the voice actors, who did their best to show every emotion, the characters they voiced felt real, and because of that it was that enjoyable to watch Aria. 
Character wise, the series has a wide range of characters: Akari, Alice, Aika, their senpais and other supporting characters. While they might look somewhat average at first, but the more you watch the series, the more you fall in love with Aria’s characters. What you might like about them, is the fact that they all are very different, yet similar. That is why it is never boring to watch the series. 
Enjoyment wise and overall, Aria is, indeed, a title that might not attract the attention of many, it is still a breath of fresh air for many, Its uniqueness and amazing world-building, with an amazingly beautiful world of Aqua for the viewer to discover. Without a single doubt, Aria is a must see for all those, who enjoy and like the SoL genre. 
10/10.

    This is NOT a review.This is a spoiler-free guide to enjoying ARIA. It is only fitting that a guide is written for a story about Aqua's guides (I think). 
First off, let me state that this is a guide to the -entire- ARIA collection, i.e. Aria the Animation, the Natural, the OVA and the Origination. I feel that it is necessary for the entire collection to be presented together since a potential viewer should watch the entire collection instead of just any one part. 
I won’t be describing what ARIA is about; it is well-described in the synopsis and other reviews. You too, would want to be the one discovering and understanding what ARIA is about to you.  
Let me first give you a rundown on what you can expect from ARIA:  
1.  You want to take a break from the usual action-packed and angst-filled anime. ARIA is a slow-paced and smooth-sailing anime. Every single episode, except the ending episodes of Origination, is standalone, but all of them will contribute to creating your vision of the world of Aqua. ARIA will not invoke strong emotions and desires, only a sense of calmness and curiosity. 
2.  You want the feeling of happiness. ARIA epitomizes happiness. Every single act or occurrence or thing that appears in ARIA will bring happiness to its characters. And happiness is contagious. 
3.  You wonder about the state of the world today, and think that the future of the world is bleak. ARIA will make you think otherwise. ARIA is filled with so much faith in its people and so much optimism in its future that it can probably bring hope to someone in (insert worst situation you can think of). 
How you should watch ARIA in order to enjoy it? 
1.  Watch it in order. Aria the Animation will introduce to you the setting and its characters. Aria the Natural will take you on a tour of its world and the many mystical happenings that occur within it. Aria the Origination will delve and develop each character to the fullest before concluding. 
2.  Don’t rush through the story. Savor every moment and every scene, like tasting a glass of well-aged wine. Heck, re-watch an episode if you want to. I sometimes tend to replay a single scene over and over before being satisfied of the feels it was conveying. 
3.  Open your mind and your heart. Don't be too quick to dismiss something as impossible, stupid, or lame. ARIA will contain varying degrees of these elements, and you should look deeper into the abstract meaning of each of them instead of judging hastily.  
Experience and maturity are essential in order to appreciate this collection to the fullest. Hopefully, ARIA will change your perspective about life.

    There's just something magical about the way Aria the Animation strikes a chord deep inside you. It doesn't show up in the typical manner nor in an easily discernible way, but slowly, inexorably, steals your heart and before you know it, you've fallen in love with each and every character. There is no moe; there are no crazy plot turns; there is no artsy action. Instead, Aria the Animation goes deeper than you think; judging a book by its cover becomes less and less relevant when diving into the waters of Neo-Venezia.  
Story: 9/10 
I really, really wanted to label this as ""slice of life"" and move on. But honestly, I couldn't - not because there actually was a crazy, flip-flopping story you'd normally expect, but because every episode was fresh and had meaning, not just some slapstick humor and that was that. There were several heart-warming moments; nothing so sad it left you depressed and nothing so happy it seemed fake, but lessons like enjoying the little things in life really hit home here. This wasn't an anime of plenitude, but instead one of deeper meanings below a facade of happy, go-lucky trio of girls. The constant references to Italy, Italian mythology and beliefs, as well as traditional food and drink kept the atmosphere lively and had a unique sense of familiarness, despite this being on a completely different planet. In general, though, I loved every last bit of every part of the story. There wasn't a plot point I didn't enjoy. The warm feeling inside after each episode made me think that this really hit the spot. 
Art: 9/10 
Now this is slightly older than I would have liked, but the animation was excellent. Nothing was skimped, from the beautifully recrafted Venice (hence the name Neo-Venezia) to each character's uniform ornamental arrangements. I couldn't find anything wrong with the animation style; everything was beautifully crafted and honed to near-perfection. There were frequent changes in style, such as when a character said something sarcastic, their faces become much simpler, to reflect such humor. In my book, any sort of simple, yet elegant art gets a darn good score anyway. Plus, nothing was ever an eyesore, and every scene generally had something new in it, reflecting the continually entertaining and changing environments the characters interacted in. 
Character: 9/10 
The characters really shine in this anime as well. There wasn't too much of an airhead, too much of a tsundere (kind of) or any sort of typical anime characterizations; no, this was something much more special. Each character fit the role laid out for them almost too perfectly. Every personality was represented, albeit in a toned-down and subtle sort of way. I found it hard to find a character I hated, for crying out loud. Every anime has that one character you wish were dead or flying into another dimension, forever forgotten and alone. But this was something unique, something I found vaguely comforting that I wasn't willing death, but life. Their daily interactions, though very wistful, belies a childlike tone and lessons of life, things rarely found in anime nowadays.  
Overall: 9/10 
Anyway, this was n interesting amalgamation: a blending of whimsical, steampunk-like science fiction, slice-of-life, some slapstick humor and genuine life lessons really impacted my heart. I kept feeling all warm and tingly inside, something you should be prepared for with plenty food items, because the food on here looks dang delicious. Generally, though, this deserved a high-ranking score, because of the lack of things I had problems with. I never had to pause for effect, never had to stop watching it because of boredom nor because it was too much; but it floated along at its own pace, never quite hurrying, yet never becoming tedious. It was interesting to say the least; I highly recommend it. Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed, sorry, I was getting all gushy.

    Sometimes, the mundane and ordinary can be the wellspring of life's greatest stories. Aria takes this idea, bludgeons it mercilessly, and runs with it. Strangely enough, it works. Actually, bludgeoning likely isn't the best verb. Sedating is more suitable, since Aria is probably the most relaxing show in recent memory.  
Aesthetically, Aria the Animation is a gorgeous series. From the pristine water that the gondolas so gracefully glide over to the well kept stone buildings, the city of Neo Venezia is brought to life by its splendid colors and vibrant tone. There's a feeling of life and soul breathed into it, yet it's calming in its tranquil beauty. History is exuded from every structure, almost as if Neo Venezia has existed for well over a thousand years, like its Earth-born counterpart.  
The characters are well designed and well animated, all unique and memorable enough to endear themselves to the viewer. Even the bit characters are given appearances that don't feel entirely generic, which is a definitely plus. During its more amusing moments, the characters' faces turn into some of the best chibi faces ever brought to anime.   
The audio, from the stellar voice acting to the soothing background music, is simply divine. While the music wouldn't likely stand on its own, it's the perfect complement to the series, bringing to life the soothing rhythm of Neo-Venetian life through acoustic guitars and soft singing.  
As a slice of life series, the story aspect takes a backseat to the characters and their interactions with each other and their environment. Strangely, it's when the story veers away from everyday life that Aria's at its weakest. The few supernatural-themed episodes are a strange departure from the norm, not really having any bearing on the overarching plot.  
While it can be argued that they're perfectly fine since the whimsical  overarching plot is broad enough in scope to allow the encompassing of a few more somber subplots, I still feel that Aria is at its slowest during these strange few episodes.  
Also, as a slice of life anime, the characters are the focus. The three undines in training, Alice, Aika, and Akari, are supported by their superiors Athena, Akira, and Alicia respectively as they go through and explore their daily lives, becoming ever closer to achieving their collective dream of becoming master gondoliers (Undines, as they are known).  
To make for even more lighthearted fare, the main trio are usually accompanied by the absurdly cute President Aria, a cat who has the sheer force of personality to carry an entire episode by himself... and seems to be harboring a deep secret that has only been alluded to. Animals have been put in series for the sake of cuteness overload and comedy before, but President Aria is arguably the best around. 
 Most will probably argue this, and I can see why. He's obnoxious enough to deter some viewers, though it didn't work on me in the slightest, so fair warning if you find small animals who yell random gibberish annoying beyond belief.  
Now, before I write a dissertation on why I think President Aria is the best cat in history ever (He has a sailor hat! What's not to love in a cat who wears a sailor hat?), I'd best wrap things up.  
Aria the Animation is a fun little series that does well in breaking away from the mold. Original for slice of life fare, with a few deviations that I felt detracted more than added anything, it will sedate you with its snail-like pacing and soothing aesthetics. Some may be put off by this, but rest assured that it's not nearly as boring as it sounds. Also notable is the overall optimistic tone. While the mood may drift into the melancholic at times, it never loses its upbeat charm and aforementioned whimsy.  
While I haven't viewed its sequels yet, and I do plan to, I can comfortably say that Aria sits toward top of my favorite series list. It does Slice of Life differently, and it does it well. Like an actual gondola drifting through the canals of Venice, Aria is relaxing and slow, the whole purpose being an observation of the everyday life of the people. 
 Never before has a show left me feeling completely at ease, unburdened by the hardships of this world. 9/10 stars

    More than a masterpiece. 
Seriously, to make this you need to be much more than a genius. Slice of life? I would not say so. It does not look like life at all. ""Aria"" series is a different world, which drags you into like a tornado. And once you are there, you don't want to go back. 
Objectively, nothing happens for the whole 53 episodes  + OVA. There is, literally, no action or plot. At all. What we see is a girl's everyday life in Neo Venezia, an imaginary city in the future at Mars. She works as a tour guide, hangs out with friends, etc etc. Why is the show so facinating? 
The answer is atmosphere. I don't know what should you do to create such an atmosphere of love, innocence and peace. Artwork, pretty simple but stunning in its simplyness, along with soundtrack create something impossible... You turn this show on and your daily worries melt away into the endless ocean of peace. Aria is a cure for my soul, the best medicine I ever found. I keep rewatching this show - slowly, gradually, repeating my favourite episodes... I don't want to leave   Neo Venezia. Ever. 
My favourite anime. I would put hundreds if availible. 10/10

    Aria the Animation and it's sequel's are pretty much held up as the pinnacle of slice of life anime. If you take a look at the reviews and the overall rating it's nothing short of glowing. Take my review with a grain of salt, since I'm definitely not a big slice of life person. 
Take any literature class, or even high school English, and you'll most likely come across the plot diagram. Introduction, rising action, climax and resolution. Conflict drives almost every story, and in terms of anime it tends to be on a fantastic scale. The end of the world, the fate of a nation or even  the ebb and flow of a romance in a harem or romantic comedy anime. Well, aria doesn't really have any conflict on a fantastic scale. In fact, it doesn't really have conflict at all. Any conflict that does pop up is quickly resolved to demonstrate is easy going mood. It barely suffices to have the skeleton of a plot. Akari, a girl from earth, travels to a terraformed mars made up entirely of water specifically to the the city of neo-venizia. It's essentially just venice on mars or Aqua as the show calls it. Akari is trying to become a professional gondola tour guide within the city, and the show supposedly follows her in trying to achieve her goal.  The pace is glacial, and most episodes are only tangentially related to Akari trying to become an undine if at all (said tour guide). Most episodes are simply the characters traveling the city by gondola in between ordinary activities. 
The lack of any kind of real plot irks me a bit but I'm getting ahead of myself. It's a slice of life show, one shouldn't expect it to be plotted like a spider web. Slice of life shows are about character interactions. Unfortunately, though initially likeable, the cast doesn't really develop much beyond basic archetypes. Among the  undines in training, there's the driven, uptight type in Aika, the reserved and mysterious Alice, and the airheaded, unfailingly cheery Akari. For their teachers and seniors, there's the motherly, gentle type in Alica, and the strict older sister of Aika in Akira.  There's a curious lack of any major male characters perhaps attributable to the show's heavy use of moe. The three trainee undines often react and act the exact same way, with blushing, cries of 'ehhhhhhhh?' or 'ahhh' and deformed cartoonish reaction faces. A few have their own catch phrases and keyed reactions to situations. That's really about it. 
So, with a ghost of a plot, a very basic character set, what exactly does aria have to keep you watching? The show actually turns out to be more than the sum of it's parts. The music is laid back flemenco and is very good, if recycled a bit, and the art depicting neo venizia is usually beautiful, except when it takes a nose dive in quality due to poor backgrounds or shoddy animation. The show has a genuinely calming effect and manages to be very charming. It takes away any stress you have and transports you to a world free of any kind of strife. So is aria a good anime? Probably. A masterpiece? Not in my opinion. If you're looking for deep characters, action or a complex plot, steer far away. It's not to me what it's cracked up to be, but judging by the other reviews and the overall score I probably can't tell you whether you'll like this or not. In any case, it's decent enough to warrant at least a few episodes worth of viewing from their each viewer can probably decide if they want to continue with the rest of the Aria franchise.

     Aria has garnered one of the most interesting reputations I have seen. Put on such an impossibly high pedestal yet still as polarizing as any other slice of life series if not more so makes it an oddity that one can't help but be curious about. And, if nothing else, Aria is a very unique challenge and experience for just about anyone.   
Aria is about a group of girls who want to become the best professional boat rowers possible. There is a lot of food and tea in between. 
Aria, for better or worse, doesn't change much throughout the course of the series. For me this caused an already episodic and formulaic series to wear thin even faster. Most of the episodes end with a message about appreciating the beauty of life, or something similar, accompanied by scenery porn and calming music. While this is admittedly quite comfy, it would work infinitely better if the series didn't run fifty-two episodes and one OVA because there's is only so many times you can impress me with an all too similar life lesson and scenery porn, Aria.   
It goes without saying slice of life series usually don't have much in the way of story in their attempt to be as feel good as possible. While not unexpected Aria sacrifices more than most since it actually does have clear overarching story with the three main characters trying to become Undines. Unfortunately this only gets sporadic focus throughout and ultimately isn't as rewarding as it should be. Instead we get a a lot of episodes focusing on the main characters doing something outside of that main goal and there is really no sense of progression.  
Regardless of the meandering structure I did enjoy the main characters of Aria a good deal despite not knowing if I wanted to pat their heads or violently face fuck them. A wise man once told me multitasking is key. They all have good characterization as well as cute designs, which is all that they really needed to have for this type of story. Like many other things in Aria they can come off as overly sappy but I suppose that is part of the charm.   
Aside from that there are a few minor issues I had with Aria. I didn't quite understand the character of Alicia who everybody in the series has a massive lady boner over. She is portrayed as ethereal and perfect which I suppose is setup for later episodes which show her face some of her faults, but these are less faults than they are sympathetic and endearing traits thus making the odd direction of her character pointless or at the very least not as effective as it could have been. The super natural elements in the series seem like they are abandoned just as quickly as they are picked up which I assume there is more to them in the manga but we are left with what we get in the show. Finally, the dialogue gave me diabetes. I know that just kind of comes with the territory of Aria but it really is over the top sometimes.  
Despite all my misgivings with Aria I still find the series incredibly thoughtful and charming. The atmosphere is unmatched and with the soft colors of the art and serene music the series is just on another level when it comes to aesthetics. Though I probably will never appreciate Aria and the slice of life genre as much as most, I can't help but enjoy the simplistic beauty of its tranquil and contemplative moments. And really, what else does Aria aim to do if not that. Well, besides making  your friends and family think you are a closeted gay.

    For starters, this anime has quite literally changed my outlook on life. Having gone through a fair amount of distress this past year, I was looking for something that could bring some tranquility to past few hectic months. Watching Aria brought me this, and so much more, and I'll explain later on. 
The story takes place in the 24th century on a terraformed Mars (now called Aqua), where Akari (our MC) strives to be a top class Undine in Neo Venezia. Truly sticking to the nature of SoL, past the first 3-4 episodes Aria the Animation is almost entirely episodic, yet it never feels boring or pointless despite the direction of the plot. Each episodes digs into each of the characters and their relationships with one another, and how they grow as people. It feels real, and it feels natural. Even the trope beach/hot springs episodes are extremely well done with 0 pandering fan service, truly sticking to the themes and ideas Aria is presenting. 
Art and Sound is where this show really starts to kick in. The art style is absolutely superb, with lush colors used in every frame and character design being memorable. The animation is very high quality as well, besides some of the chibi moments that feel very jarring next to the usually-smooth animation.  
As for Sound, Aria hands down, has one of the best OSTs around period. From the relaxing OP to the light-hearted ED, and even all of the background soundtracks playing throughout the show, the music for this show is astoundingly well-realized. It is an absolute perfect fit, both for the Italian setting and for the overall mood of the show. Special mention to the OP which is, by far, one of the best OPs I've ever had the pleasure to listen to.  
The characters are also surprisingly well-developed for the plot being as lax as it is. All of them are likable, and they all serve a purpose in the plot. Special mention to how well developed Aqua is as well, almost every plothole that could have come from essentially setting Venice on Mars was covered (i.e weather being artificially controlled, gravity being regulated undergrounds by gnomes etc.). You can clearly see how much thought the author put into not only the characters, but Aqua itself.  
All these elements fuse together to form an experience unlike any other. No drama, no action, no conspiracies, no villains, just a tranquil story of three young girls realizing their dreams, little by little in a beautiful world. You really do feel bliss when watching this, even more so after going through some rough times. Aria teaches you to look at the bright and positive things in life, a profound yet very forgotten message in the current industry saturated with excessive action and drama.  
Aria the Animation is definitely as least worth a try, if for no other reason that it just being different from any other show out there. A masterfully crafted anime, held back by a couple of technical issues, it truly is a heart warming and positive experience.

    Story: The story is slow-paced which offers a relaxing atmosphere, although it also doesn't do much to draw you in. The story does however give a romantic view of the world, from small things to big, and is quite beautifully done at times. One of the points that I really like about the story is how the concluding episodes tie back to the beginning to give the story a very wholesome feeling.  
Animation: The artwork was splendidly done and really enhanced the mood. I noticed that the series' depiction of water especially, a central theme to the show, was beautifully portrayed and could be mesmerizing in its serenity.  
Sound: The sound is elegant and fits well with the rest of the anime. Although not outstanding on its own, it really works well to create the tranquil mood that defines the series so well.  
Character: The characters were solid and thoroughly enjoyable. The main trio's personalities worked well in tangent with one another which provided for a lot of fun scenes. The supporting roles were also developed well and they contributed to the anime's overall theme and storyline. Every new character that Akari met had something to add that gave more meaning to the story.  
Enjoyment: Despite a lot of solid good points about the series, the slow pace was honestly boring at times. There wasn't enough to draw me in and give me incentive to continue watching other than a desire to see watch a beautiful story. The story didn't have much tragedy, romance, or action through which to provide excitement and could feel lacking at times. In the end, the slow pace really impaired my ability to fully enjoy the show.  
Overall: There were many points I liked about the story and several others I disliked. In the end though, the story synthesized its elements into a well-developed piece. The story, art, sound, and character development all came together to produce a beautiful and idealistic story that leaves you feeling relaxed and content.

    I have been told from many different internet sites that Aria is the greatest of all slice of life animes. While slice of life animes usually don't attract me, I decided to give Aria a try. I just finished the first season over about a week and still have the buzz of the last episode all over. It definitely was a unique watch. 
Aria takes place far in the future. Mankind has successfully given Mars a habitable environment, complete with the same force of gravity as Earth's, an atmosphere that is equally capable of absorbing blue light, massive oceans rivaling Earth's, and a very diverse biolife, all imported from Earth and successfully multiplied. They have also created an extremely fast and efficient method of travel between Earth and Mars and now people come to Mars for vacations. Despite all this, the world of Aria is very rural, with very little technology at all. The only pieces of technology I can recall, in fact, are the space shuttles that float in the sky, the mailman's flying motorbike, data cards, along with a very old type of phone. 
The anime focuses on the lives of three undiines [girls in training to become primas (girls who row the gondolas in this water filled planet)]. These girls have almost no problems in their lives and are free to train and relax as the days pass. Its peaceful, relaxing, stress-free, but I can't say I was really able to relax that much while watching this show.  
The story by itself is fine I suppose. Many of the middle episodes were a little too slow and calming, but the end episodes were good. The problem is that the whole time I was watching this anime, I was dying to know answers that were never going to be answered. For example, there was one episode where the whole girl team goes to a uninhabited island and have a good time at the beach. Somewhere in there, one of the girls says ""I'm so happy to swim in the ocean. Nobody can swim in the oceans back at Man Home anymore so I've never done it before"". Ehhhh is that so? Exactly what happened to the oceans back on Earth that they are no longer alright to swim in? Is there mass pollution on Earth now or are the oceans too cold or what? I really wanted the anime to stop focusing on peace on Mars and transfer to the potential mayhem happening on Earth. It never does though, and I am left with no answers. 
I can't say I am one of the people of enjoy this kind of anime. I really just don't see the charm in it. Why are slice of lifes so typical in lacking any elements that make other anime so great? An anime can still be a slice of life anime and at the same time contain drama, action, adventure, Plot. Slice of life doesn't have to equate to happy go lucky peaceful animes featuring an almost all female cast doing almost nothing (looking at you Lucky Star). But at least Lucky Star was humorous, this anime was not. It was basically a sleep inducer, with almost every episode almost putting me to sleep. A better adjective for this anime would be 'boring'. I'm sorry but in such an interesting science fiction world such as this, I want to see some science fiction, not some slice of life sleep inducer.  
Lots of people like this type of anime though, so I'll go ahead and recommend it. However, people like me, who like a core plot directing the anime with action, humor, drama, romance, or whatever will flee from anime like this and go back to other slice of life animes with those things, such as NHK Ni Youkoso, Toradora, or Clannad.

    If I were to describe this anime with a single word, the word would probably be ""boring"". Surprising perhaps, given that it lies in the ""Good"" region of my rating scales, but that's what this anime is. In this case, ""boring"" isn't used so much to label ""Aria"" as an unwatchably dull anime (though to some it probably is) as to describe what actually happens in it, which is absolutely nothing. For ""Aria"", in many ways, represents the very essence of a slice-of-life anime. 
In ""Aria"", there are no evil villains to fight, no complicated plots to untangle, no philosophical conundrums to contemplate... just about the only interesting detail in ""Aria"" is that it's set on Mars, a Mars of the future that resembles Venice with its abundance of water and gondolas. But don't let this exotic location fool you into thinking this is a setting for a futuristic sci-fi anime, because you'll be sorely disappointed. That detail is pretty much restricted to being background information - as far as the anime itself is concerned, it may as well be set in Venice, as it doesn't really do much with the Mars bit. 
Beyond its settings, ""Aria"" is plain to such an extent that no measurable aspect of this anime stands out in any way: the animation is ok... in a boring way; the music... despite often having unconventional melody progressions that gave it a distinct feel, only manage to leave an impression of being boringly good; as for the content... it's virtually non-existent. Every episode is pretty much just a case of the unremarkable characters going about their mundane daily tasks - they barely even qualify for the adventure-of-the-week description. But then, this is what the slice-of-life genre is all about, right? Yes, ""Aria"" may not be the most interesting of anime, but it does deliver in the department where this kind of anime is expected to deliver, and that is in the ""heart"" of the show - the part that gives it that indescribable feel good factor. This is epitomised by the last episode, which is a very typical slice-of-life open ending where there's no grand finale, but there's a vague sense of temporary closure at the end, with the option of extending into a second season wide open. But despite the lack of a climax, it does leave you bursting with a wonderful glowing feeling inside, with a twinge of sadness that comes from reaching the end of the series that you've become fond of. It's this that allows ""Aria"" to soar above the sum of its very plain parts. 
Even though I have a soft spot for Aria, I'd hesitate to recommend it to many people. A lot of them would probably fall asleep watching it. Other slice-of-life anime have additional aspects to keep you watching - Genshiken has its comedy and entertainment values; Planetes has its humble (and also not so humble) heroics and intense drama; Paradise Kiss has its eccentricity and interesting relationship dynamics... ""Aria"" doesn't have any of these things, and instead offers the viewer a simple yet hard to quantify pleasure that comes from watching a slice-of-life that's been distilled down to its purest form. It's something for the connoisseurs of the genre to slowly enjoy. And if you ask them why it's good, their response would probably be the same as mine: it... just is!

    Danger Danger!Keep out if you can't handle strong language and sarcasm...And humour in general...And if you have some kind of allergy in different opinions..Basically sod off and read something else. 
I don't know why i do this to myself..I really don't.I may be a masochist and not even know it.Cause i was hearing them little voices in my head screaming at the top of their imaginary lungs to not watch Aria.Did i listen?Of course not cause as it seems i may have a tendency towards the leather and gag ball end of things.If by any chance you are a goth mistress and on the look for a hat stand give me a shout,will ya? 
But let's dive into Aria..Not literally,unless you're into cats..No not cats like people with cat ears,i mean cats,those hairy bastards that want to conquer the world,make us their slaves and bathe in a pool full of human blood.If you're a cat owner get rid NOW or forever be doomed.Get a dog,they're loyal and i've seen vids where they're trained to fetch beer from the freezer. 
And we hit it off with the story..Or the lack of one.I say that cause the story is the one told in the synopsis and only there,nothing even remote to a story exists in the anime itself.So let's see what the synopsis says:The story takes place on Aqua,formerly known as Mars until they filled it with water 150 years ago,in the city of Neo-Venice,a replica of Earth's Venice.The recreation of Venice is one of the things i liked about Aria.They actually took time to do research in order to include famous Venetian landmarks such as the St Mark’s Basilica,the island of Burano and Plaza San Marco.The architecture and feel of the place is rather accurate,but unlike the real Venice if you happen to fall in the water you don't end up with 2 heads. 
Each episode follows some ""plot"" of some sorts,but as far as i can tell there's no life in this anime's plots.They are just some small adventures everyone has seen in one way or another in other animes.Imagine an anime about someone stopping at a small mart to buy some milk and he realises he doesn't have enough money on him.So he has to go to the bank and take some money and go back to buy the milk..That's it..Nothing even remotely interesting.But you might say:""yeah it has some shit going on here and there""..And that's the problem.The only few surprises that try and spark some life into this corpse are some random shit,like ""hey time travel""...As to why and how this happened that remains a mystery.Nothing is being explained.It's just your basic moe cancer with the pleasant feel.And last time i checked moe isn't story or plot it's just ebola through the internet. 
As for the characters you have Akari who dreams of being a gondolier at pro level(pilot of the boats Venice is famous for)under the guidance of the wise Obi-Alicia who is blond.Then a weird thing happens as we are being introduced to other characters that their names begin with the letter ""A""..I guess the alphabet wasn't invented?Get this for unimaginative naming..Aika who has blue hair,Akira who is the bitchy bitch teacher and Alice who i don't remember what she was doing there.Oh yes....There is a cat like creature that tries endlessly to sag another catlike creature...Soooo....Yeah it's moe.. 
Animationwise the details in the way the whole world is built and even the water movement and rflections are spot on..The characters themselves are pretty standard. 
Songs and VA were ok-ish i think..Maybe they were good and i was sound asleep. 
And now i must conclude this review so i can go drink my arse off and forget i even saw this.It isn't bad as such.And what with all these praising reviews and 3 seasons in total i expected something among the lines of a Japanese blockbuster.Unfortunately,little good can be said about this anime but not all of it is bad.I can only say that if you want an anime you can watch with your eyes and brain completely shut,then this is for ya.If you want substance of any sorts,even if it's just a little watch something else.How the hell did this thing manage to get so many seasons?Were you there on the land of the rising sun on drugs or something?Or maybe do you happen to have a weird sense of humour and thought it would be fun to export this shit to the west and stand back and laugh?

    This is pure therapeutic bliss. Literally. 
The story is simple and in execution turns out great. Taking into account the fact that this is a slice-of-life, the pacing is so wonderfully planned out, and the episodic stories so well-rounded in themselves, that one should never find oneself bored out of his wits from exploring the wonderful place that is Neo-Venezia. 
And that is a real feat. 
ART 
Oh god the background is beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. 
And accurate (mostly) too, as some guy from Lonely Planet frequenting Animesuki and going on a (mostly business) trip to Venice found out. 
Decent effort was also made for the characters. Only 1 obvious QUALITY image ever jumped out at me after the third rewatch and for the most part there were no flaws. Though it'd have been nice if the faces were drawn anywhere nearly as detailed as in the manga. But then that'd have to be budget-busting stuff. 
Production IG was roped in for the CG but it didn't seem all that impressive to me, though it certainly was enough to add to the atmosphere. 
SOUND 
And here, sir, is where this anime is made into the ideal therapeutic experience. Every single piece of music in every single scene is perfectly fitted together. The decision for Choro Club to cut a major album out of this meant the resulting music was absolutely, astoundingly brilliant. Coupled to the show, it was outstanding and perfectly fitting, while on its own it can be summed up as &quot;perfect&quot; (...that is, if you don't hate the Brazilian-style choro and the relaxing tune). The late Kawai Eri worked her magic into the very fitting OP that was soothing to the ears, while Round Table as usual put in a brilliant song for an ED. The insert song was pretty catchy too. 
CHARACTER 
Here unfortunately I'll have to put in some criticism. Most of the characters are simply not well-developed. We get to see the character of every, uh, character, but not much else. The sempai especially. There's almost no background story on them. Plus, they all seem so eerily close to perfect, it's unreal. 
That aside, Akari elevates herself to Goddess status as we see through her beautifully clear eyes the wonders of her world. And it is through her that the stories turn out so beautiful, so wonderful. 
Needless to say I loved this to bits. Every episode left me yearning for more wonderfulness, and I eventually wasted a whole day marathoning it when I should have been rushing for projects. It's guaranteed to lift your spirits, relieve whatever pressure you might of had, and turn any pessimist into a perenially happy optimist. 
OVERALL 
A beautiful slice-of-life anime all in all, and considering the popularity this had at its airing, way too under-watched. This show needs some love; spread the Aria lovin'.

    Aria the Animation is the first of three anime series adapted from the Aria manga and focuses mainly on introducing the main characters - Akari, Aika and Alice - and the world of Aqua and Neo-Venezia, without going into much depth and while keeping an extremely relaxing and soothing atmosphere. 
For that reason the pacing of the first series can be a little off-putting to some viewers, as the new elements each episode adds are developed only to a limited scope (the introduction) and it might feel as though the whole series is nothing more than cute characters, chilly backgrounds, and relaxing BGM, especially to those viewers who aren't used to the slice of life genre - The Animation is more about taking it easy than actually developing the characters. 
Technically, the animation is quite good for a slice of life show, and the amount of effort put by the creators can easily be seen in the backgrounds, water motion, coloring, and the detail of the buildings and scenery. The beautiful art, together with the soundtrack, which is the most memorable out of the three seasons, really creates atmosphere and attempts to draw the viewer in without much effort. 
Aria accomplishes the hard task of keeping characters simple while maintaining a degree of originality that allows them to always look fresh; the interactions between characters feel natural and both the comedy and dialogue are presented as though they are part of normal conversations, rather than a crafted script beforehand. 
Although I enjoyed the series immensely and would highly recommend it, I must admit the series might not suit everyone's tastes, especially if the viewers are expecting realistic characters and situations because NOTHING is realistic in Aria. 
The utopian setting and the unrealistic character portrayal are instruments the series makes use to achieve its main goal: healing. Aqua is a world where everyone is nice, and the dialogues are often sappy (to the point of making recurring jokes about it). 
Aria the Animation slowly invites you to join the characters in their discovery of that beautiful world, almost as if Akari invited you for a ride on her gondola.

    Yes, I think Aria the Animation is mediocre. I'm saying this with thrown chest, and proud gaze, that I watched as much as I could stomach, and finally shown myself mercy at 10 episodes mark. 
Stories are just weak, and it's not the ""there are no boobies and guns blazing, and no one is punching someone"" weak, it's a ""nobody gives a single fuck about this story, and it's not written well enough to be interesting"" weak. I've seen my share of slice of life, no-drama anime, and it's my favorite, which is why I tried watching Aria, so don't shit me with your ""hurr durr it's animu for acquired tastes of elite individuals, not bleach fans"". 
ALL of it's characters have annoying catchphrases that they try to force into every single thing that escapes their badly animated mugs (i'm looking at you, alice. I'm fucking looking at you. fuck your dekkai everything.), the main mascot is just ugly and retarded (it took me 2 episodes to determine it's actually a cat, and only thanks to characters explicitly saying that it does belong to felis catus species). 
Slice of life genre itself exists as a testament to superior ability of storywriters, who manage to make day-to-day life interesting, soothing and fun to watch, a concept the creators of aria obviously failed to grasp. 
And before nostalgia templars move in, no, this anime doesn't deserve any bonus points for being 10 years old, nor it's ""quirkiness"" can be appreacieated only by ""not kid audience"", as there are many, MANY shows with better stories than this. 
tl;dr  
show is mediocre at best, and if there are any hidden values or qualities making it worthwhile, I certainly couldn't find them. I don't know how do succesing seasons fare, obviously, but this one effectively discouraged me from giving them a chance.

    We all live in a very fast paced world.  To us humans, time is everything, and every second used is a second that can be used to be more ""productive"" or ""better"".  Because of this, we become creatures of habit, living cogs that let life fly by us without a moment's thought.  We don't really take time to enjoy the smaller things in life, to just sit down, relax, and take in the finer things that can go unnoticed.  It is here where we have Aria the Animation, a gem from 2005, and the beginning of the whole Aria series.   
Author's note:  If I write down any sappy lines, I'm sorry.  It's just hard not to do that for this series. 
Story (8.00/10): Aria the Animation takes place in the world known as Aqua, an alien planet settled and created by humans as a sort of ""second planet"" in order to satisfy the human population.  It is here on this newly created blue planet where we have Akari, our protagonist in this series, settle down on the new planet in a city named Neo-Venezia, a city built based on the city of Venice in Italy.  Here, she learns how to be a Prima Undine, a gondola driver, as she begins her life on this new and peaceful world.   
The story of Aria is a very simplistic story, focusing more on the day to day lives of the characters here on the planet of Aqua, mainly the lives of three specific girls, as they train themselves to be Prima Undine.  For any given episode, the characters in the series essentially live their lives on this planet, not really doing much else aside from dealing with the trials and tribulations that lives throw at us.   
From the storyline of the series, it's quite clear that Aria is not really a series that deals with conflicts as heavily as many series these days do.  The tone of the show is calming, serene, and overall, less dramatic than your average anime.  With the whole of its runtime, the show never tries to deviate from its relaxing tone.  As a result, the overall feel of the show is very unique because as you're watching it, you never really get the sense that anything dramatic will happen.  Now, with zero conflicts, does that mean that this show is bad?  Quite the opposite in fact. 
The show tackles the smaller things in life.  Throughout the whole show, we are presented with scenes of the characters doing what people generally do in life.  Spend time with friends, doing chores, eating a meal, and even going on an outing; stuff that you would normally see in any given slice of life show.  However, Aria takes this idea one sep further.  Aside from just seeing that characters experience these moments in life, it also takes them into account, putting them in retrospect to one's own life, affirming how we as people can miss the finer details, the smaller experiences that we sometimes fail to see.   
In addition to that, the show does a decent job at world building.  Rather than just letting the setting of a different world be just a stated fact, Aria the Animation adds in to that by spending a good chunk of its runtime explaining the world's history, tying that into its life affirming story, making the two work in conjunction to make the story a lot more cohesive and adds to the experience.   
With all these good points, what is there to be said badly about this series?  Well, more or less, it's the calming atmosphere that the story has.  Because this show is quite slow and doesn't possess any lingering conflicts, Aria can at times be rather boring.  (I found this to be the case at times.)  It's not that the show itself is bad, it's just that watching something so slow can leave someone to be desiring a little bit more.  Of course, that's not true for everyone, but personally, I couldn't watch more than a couple episodes at a time simply because of how I sort of lost interest sometimes.   
Regardless of that side effect of Aria's wonderfully calming atmosphere, the story of Aria is still very exceptional.  It puts the things in life that we sometimes forget, forward, giving the audience a feeling of appreciation of things that we may often forget.   
Overview: 
+  Some World building 
+  Very calming show 
+  Fantastic themes 
-   Calming factor can leave some people bored (To combat this, I suggest watching 2-3 episodes at one time rather than marathoning.) 
Characters (7.99/10): Similar to its story, Aria the Animation doesn't have very complicated characters, each of which really following their own certain characteristics and never really deviating from the traits that they were given at time.   
First we have Akari Muzunashi, the ""main protagonist"" of this series.  As the only apprentice in the Aria Company, Akari plays off as a very simple girl, wanting only to enjoy the time that she has on Aqua, frequently throwing out ""sappy lines"" in order to express her gratitude or overall enjoyment of the time that she spends with the people that she's grown to know in her time in Aqua.  Akari also plays a very crucial role in this series by writing these letters at the end of every episode, essentially writing down any given episode's important takeaway, bolstering the things that the episode is talking about.  It is because of this specifically that I think Aria excels at what it does, because the things that it talks about can really be an eye opener at times. 
Then we have Aika Granzchesta, a Single from the Hime Company, a different gondola company that rivals the Aria Company.  Being the girl that is somewhat more outgoing than the other two, being very proud of her own abilities, Aika is the second girl in the series you meet with her classic line of ""No sappy lines"" (or any other variation of that phrase.)  In addition, to round out the trio of girls in this series, is Alice, a Pair from the Orange Planet company, (And no, she does not belong to a pest-control agency.)  acting as the youngest of the trio, working to hone her abilities as well as spending time with her senpais from the other companies.   
Apart from these main three girls in this series, we also have their instructors Alicia, Akira, and Athena, who serve similar roles to their apprentice counterparts, as well as the three feline company presidents.  In addition, there are side characters that appear every once in a while, filling in the gaps to make the series feel more populated and overall more enjoyable as you see the personalities of all the characters come together and just live life.   
Overall, the characters themselves aren't really that complicated.  Like general slice of life, the traits that they are given at the start of their appearances persist with them throughout the whole of the series, with slight growth every now and then to show progression.  Above all, what I think is most interesting is that these characters are very memorable.  They're not very complicated, but even if they don't show up for a while, the characters that you meet aren't really that easily forgettable, which I find to be a plus for the series.   
+  Very simple characters that are easily memorable 
+  Good character dynamics 
+  Good side characters 
-   Mostly one note characters in a sense 
Art and Sound (8.08/10 and 8.78/10):  The art for Aria the Animation itself is honestly a surprise to me.  Because of its age (being that it's a 2005 anime), I had originally thought that the artstyle wouldn't stack up and would be less graphically well done as the anime that we see as of now.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was rather well animated.  T 
The artstyle reflects the feeling you get from the anime of serenity and calmness.  There are no horrendously bright colors, there isn't any dark brooding colors, and there is certainly no ecchi.  Aria's artsyle itself is very classic, being an individual looking style of animation that is bother memorable and very well made for its time.  (Like seriously.  I saw things in 2014 that looked worse than Aria.)  It's a very simple style of animation with enough detail to make the city of Neo-Venezia look beautiful, and it just simply...works.   
In addition, for comedic feel, every one of the main characters has a ""second face"", where they all have a specific expression that they make whenever they want their audience to bust a funny.  (Just a detail that I found to be quite amusing.) 
As for the soundtrack, Aria boasts a very well made OST that reflects the feel of the series.  In addition to having ""Undine"" and ""Rainbow"" as the OP and ED respectively, the series has a very calming and beautifully crafted soundtrack that adds to the calm feeling of this series.  As for the OP and ED, Undine, its opening, is a very calm and serene peace that I bet can calm any spirit, sounding like flowing spring water as it wafts through your ears, cleansing you of any hardships that you may be experiencing.  As for Rainbow, its ED, it showcases a very cheerful and bouncy feel that is very upbeat and enjoyable to listen to.  Overall, this soundtrack is beautiful, a masterpiece that is timeless.   
+  Very good animation for its time period 
+  Very classic looking artstyle 
+  Exceptional soundtrack 
Personal Enjoyment (9.00/10): When I first heard about Aria the animation, I was always puzzled why it was so popular, and why it was so revered as a classic.  After some time, I decided to watch it, and boy, am I happy I did.  The themes of the series were very well delivered, and I couldn't stop wearing a smile on my face when I was watching it.  (Above all, I listened to the OP and ED every time.  That doesn't happen very often.) 
Did I like this anime? 
Yes.  A very big yes.  Aria showcased something that anime for me has been lacking for a while; a simple story that is at the same time, very powerful.  Coupled with the beautiful soundtrack, the great animation, and some pretty memorable characters, there was hardly anything about this series that I didn't enjoy. 
What didn't I like about this anime? 
The only thing I didn't like was how at times, I admit, I felt kind of bored watching this series.  With its lack of conflict, Aria's peaceful tone can sometimes be overwhelming.  As a result, marathoning this show can be difficult for some.  Apart from that, I have no complaints.   
Would I recommend this anime? 
After finally watching the legendary Aria the Animation, yes, I would recommend people to watch this series.  Contrary to anime today, there is no fanservice, it's deep without needing any drama/melodrama, it's a simple story that doesn't poke itself into any other genre aside from Slice-of-life, and above all, it is considered to be a classic.  This show is an instant cheer-up, and to this day, is still a very revered series.  So, if you haven't watched this series, I highly recommend you do.  It's an experience that you won't want to forget.   
Overall Score:  8.35/10  (I'm sorry if there were any sappy lines.  I can't help it!  :S   )

    (This has been adapted from my reddit thread) 
There's a lot that goes on in a day-to-day basis that can easily elevate stress levels. Rushing to work due to oversleeping or caring for a crying child bring about more trouble than was initially had. Eventually, these separate events can pile together to the point of breaking. It's at this time that a reprieve is needed. A much-earned break, that brings simple serenity and peace of mind. And it's during this mellow moment that one discovers that the simple things in life are truly precious. Aria the Animation takes this to heart, marking the start of a rather laid-back journey. 
Aria the Animation essentially follows Akari, a young woman working for the Aria Company, a tour-by-gondola establishment. Alongside her best friends Aika and Alice, they meet many different people as they aspire to be ""Prima Undines."" 
If there is a word that best describes the show, the first one to come to mind is ""calm."" Above anything else, Aria exudes a blissful feeling that washes over the audience like the waters they ride upon. Its ability to achieve such an effect is done mostly by the way in which it portrays itself. Aria first and foremost makes it its mission to avoid conflict or high-pressure situations. The ""action"" taking place never goes beyond leaves blowing in the wind; at most, riding an air-bike and paddling backwards are the extent of the ""dangers"" that take place. The norm is much quieter: a small conversation by the fire with cocoa, a nighttime look at the shining stars, and basking in the warmth of the sun at the beach are poignant scenarios that demonstrate exactly what makes Aria so peaceful. 
But it's also more than just the scenes themselves. Each episode follows a simple format: a small talk in the beginning to present its theme, providing the evidence to support it, and finally a few words tying it all together. The majority of the themes tackled are general, and therefore apply to most people. Ideas such as taking a step back to look at a situation from a different perspective or learning to see the silver-lining are applicable to anyone. Now, the themes are not particularly powerful; not only is there a constant turnover but also, due to their overall generality, it makes many of them rather cliché. The execution is there -- due mostly to the calm atmosphere and basic approach -- but it's missing endearment or everlasting impact. 
Most slice-of-life shows end there, but Aria twists the formula slightly. Typically, this genre of anime requires a strong cast due to a weaker narrative, and therefore much of the focus is placed on the characters. However, here, it does the opposite; the world, Aqua, is what matters most. Akari and the girls, being Neo-Venezia tour guides, are tasked with explaining the setting to the tourists aboard their gondolas. But what's interesting is that it's not just the tourists gaining knowledge, but the viewer is, too. In essence, the watcher is getting the same experience as the people who paid for the trip. This sounds straightforward: they're all guides, so it's normal for them to describe Aqua out loud. And it is, but that is the beauty of this simplicity. Learning about the Salamanders who work in Ukijima that keep track of water and temperature levels, witnessing the different Undine companies, and understanding the Gnomes who are responsible for regulating the gravity of the planet comes off as completely natural because it's both the girls' livelihood and forte. While the world-building isn't always done ""on the job,"" it's delivered in a concise manner; a figurative gondola ride. 
The art for Aria the Animation is nicely done, but it seems to be missing the second part of its title. 
Putting Aqua at the forefront once more, the art style puts a lot of attention towards what Neo-Venezia and the surrounding area has to offer. Rustic bridges, multi-windowed houses, outside cafes, prominent statues, and narrow canals really do make it look and feel like the Venice it envisioned. At the same time, the colors and lighting are very soft, adding once more to the calmness of the package. And when the anime is looking to inject some comedy here and there, the girls adopt different faces -- Akari's becomes rectangular-like, Aika's becomes cat-like, and Alice's becomes fish-like -- to good effect. 
The character designs are actually rather interesting. Besides just the varying hair styles and colors, of important note are the Undines' attire. Consisting of a white cap and gown, laced with the color of the company they represent, the outfit is both futuristic and classic. Alongside them are the goggled, jacketed Woody, the formal Akatsuki, and the short yet cloaked Al, each of whom fit the look of their respective roles nicely. 
Actual animation is usually about average, when it is present. The problem lies in the aforementioned refusal to do anything even remotely with their bodies. A lot of talking and sitting is had, meaning most of the animation is comprised of moving mouths or shifting positions slightly, with the occasional over-exaggeration. On top of this, the camera purposefully provides more scenic views of Aqua to accomplish two tasks at once: less actual animation and more environment viewing. 
The cast of Aria the Animation play their parts, but not much more. 
Alice is a young girl who works for the Orange Company. Initially isolated due to her lack of empathy, she learns the value of friendship through Akari's way of dealing with others and their predicaments. In other words, Alice begins to go ""more with the flow,"" enjoying what life has to offer now; she sees that that is a much more rewarding way to live. Extremely talented in the art of gondola controlling, she becomes a pseudo-rival to Aika, motivating each other to perform better during training. Above all, while she rarely speaks, she isn't afraid to speak her mind, letting others know precisely how she is feeling should she be pushed to do so. 
As the ""head"" of the Himeya family, and subsequently working for Himeya Company, Aika is a proud and determined Single. Her best friend is Akari, and from this relationship sprouts her most famous phrase: ""No sappy lines allowed!"" Idolizing Alicia but loathing Akira, Aika comes to understand two vital lessons. One, that people are complex; just because someone acts a certain way doesn't mean that the extent of their person has been discovered. And two, life isn't always about working or training; everybody deserves to have fun from time to time. 
Rounding out the up-and-coming Primas is Akari. With her unending happiness, affable personality, and beautiful optimism, she exemplifies kindness in all of its forms. Working for the Aria Company, she cares for the President of the same name while receiving wisdom from Alicia. As the lead, she experiences every motif firsthand. Cherishing memories, believing in miracles, and providing help; each message given throughout the anime fits wonderfully with Akari's softhearted ideologies. Interestingly, Akari literally goes into the past in three, separate instances. The clue for why this occurs is found in the third, when Ai -- her Manhome friend and messaging buddy -- also goes with her. And it is love. Not love for the people she doesn't know, not love for her closest companions, but love for Aqua itself. Above anyone else, Akari understands what the world is and what it can offer. In short, Akari knows that it's love that makes a difference. 
As a final note, there is an intriguing comparison to be made between the trainee and master pairs. When looking closely, there exists a similar yet dichotomous relationship for each individual coupling. Athena and Alice are both prodigies, but the former is known for her singing while the latter is known for her rowing. Akira has a harsh outer shell but is soft on the inside, as opposed to Aika's outwardly composed yet inwardly critical self. And Alicia listens while rarely speaking, but Akari can always be heard providing some poetic line. The young women have the Three Great Water Fairies teaching them because they complement what each lacks: confidence, balance, and patience, respectively. While their influence has yet to fully latch on, the purpose for their connection has not. 
The OP is a rather beautiful song. It starts with gentle singing, and is followed by the tapping of drums and soft violin. The vocalist is given the opportunity to demonstrate some prowess through nice vocal range, providing the audience with the ""winding down"" that is needed to watch the show. 
The ED is a strange step down. In comparison, it is rather lame but can still be quite catchy. The fun guitar, more plain vocals, and background singers give the whole piece a tame feeling that fits the show but doesn't have the same power as its counterpart. 
The soundtrack, like the events and art alongside it, further adds to the soothing feel of the show. Guitar-playing, simple piano pieces, whistling tunes, and caring violins are interspersed throughout the entire experience. Everything is quite slow, following the crawling of the story itself. However, at certain points, there are played more lyrical-heavy tracks that detract from the anime and its overall goal of keeping easygoing. 
As for voice acting, the performances involved are mostly above-average. Eri Kawai, as the singer for Athena, was always captivating to hear. Erino Hazuki as Akari for her kind way of speaking, Sayaka Ohara as Alicia for her motherly inflection, and Chinami Nishimura as President Aria for her unintelligible but cute sounds; each deserves a special shout-out. 
While watching the show, it really did give me that sense of being ""chill."" That the happenings going on to Akari and the gang were so regular and sweet that it became quite difficult not to be at ease. Unfortunately, some of the moments were unemotional when they should have been -- Akari delivering Ami's letter and Akari seeing her snowbug friend off at the start of winter are some that come to mind. 
Many of the segments are not particularly engaging, but it can be quite humorous when it wants to be. Akari's usual ""Ehh?"" replies after being scolded by Aika, Athena's clumsiness, and Alicia's constant use of, ""My, my"" are repetitive, but were usually able to make me smile. And this goes for every character; they have their shtick that is used quite frequently yet never really feels overdone. 
Heading in the right direction, Aria the Animation, for the most part, accomplished what it wanted to begin. It's calming, it's funny at times, and most of all it's simple. While the characters are weak and both sound-work and animation could see some improvement, the story and art help to alleviate some of the issues. All that being said, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what Akari, Aika, and Alice will be showing me next in the city of Neo-Venezia.

    The past has always been a concept of fascination and longing, sometimes even to the point of obsession. One only has to read Scot Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" or J.D. Salinger's ""The catcher in the Rye"" to see wonderful examples of stories and characters obsessed with time and living in the ostensibly golden world of the past. Humans are very guilty of this crime, we constantly refer to the good old days, we flock to ruins and ancient cities as we believe them to have an almost magical quality, we invariably ignore the words of George Orwell who once said ""contrary to popular belief the past was not more eventful than the present"". It would seem to me that this love of the past is as ubiquitous as love itself, and so it should come as no surprise to find it alive and well in the anime world…  
Aria may be a series set centuries in the future, but its heart is very much in the past, be it in its setting, its customs, its outlook or its characters. But before we get into that, a quick summary of the show. 
Aria the Animation is the first season of the highly acclaimed Aria series, the setting is a terraformed mars, renamed Aqua due to the now abundance of water. Here mankind has settled into a quieter existence, more reminiscent of the early 19th century than one would expect of a space colony. The main city is Neo-Venezia, a complete reconstruction of the ancient city of Venice, it is here that our main character, Akari Mizunashi, arrives to fulfil her dream of becoming an Undine (female gondolier). She soon falls in the love with the city, its people and their quiet way of life…  
From this point on the show for the most part drops its sci-fi shawl and becomes much more fantastical and archaic, to the point that it becomes easy to forget that your on mars or even watching a sci-fi show at all. Instead a slow but steady atmosphere is built up and a tangible world appears before your eyes, it becomes not a story but an experience, and a truly unique and beautiful one at that. 
Upon hearing this synopsis it would be perfectly within reason to assume this series will be nothing more than a lighthearted fluffy sci-fi show with some hippy free spirited tendencies, nothing could be further from the truth.   
I take issue with people who label, or worse, accuse this series of being ""just episodic"", granted the series can indeed give this impression and the record of the episodic genre is not a particularly clean one, but there are many things that set this series apart from that taboo genre. One is the excellent characters which help to tie everything together while conveying the feeling that your watching real people living their lives and not just acting out a plot or random adventures. And the other is the recurring themes present in the series, in particular the theme of the past and of manmade miracles...     
With it slow pace, longing for the past and love of beauty, Aria manages to convey a feeling thats hard to describe, but is best summed up with the face you make while watching it, a sort of sad smile, a sardonic grin, a longing to be there but a desire to be distant, to keep from tainting its peace and beauty. From its canals and streets flooded with moonlight, its rustic buildings, the different Undine companies and traditions to the simple mailman, a world is quickly built up that soaks you in its cooling imaginative water. The show itself becomes a celebration of mankind and it ability to create beauty, but also destroy (more later). I mentioned earlier the theme of manmade miracles, this idea that man can create wondrously beautiful things if he really wants to  is extremely prevalent, after all the whole planet is essentially of human construct, the cities, the air, the water, the atmosphere, the temperature is all man and woman made. A point the show is constantly reminding us of, ""No Gods or Kings only man"" seems an extremely fitting quote to apply to this spirt, here mankind and individuals came together to create something incredibly beautiful with the result being that people's feelings and desires have actually allowed for an atmosphere where more conventional miracles can occur.  
This atmosphere is unique among anime, or any series I know of for that matter, few come close to achieving its healing and peaceful aurora, only certain episodes of Natsume Yanijico or the manga Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou can touch it.  But do not get the wrong impression of what i mean, this is no frosted cake of sugary sweetness, superficially perhaps, but under it all there is a distinct bitter after taste, oh its subtle all right but make no mistake its there. From Akari's occasional references to the state of Manhome (a.k.a Earth, I know its a stupid name) and how ""you can't swim in the sea's of Manhome anymore"" give earth a distinct dystopian feeling, and her fascination with all the simple wonders of utopian Neo-Venezia make one wonder just what her childhood was really like back on earth, which seems to have been all but ruined by man and woman. On top of that we have episodes dealing with letters to dead men, journeys to the past and worrying about the future. Again seeing this fascination with the past tinged with sombre nostalgia which sees to permeate throughout the whole show, creating this mix of feelings, happiness tinged with remorse, joy mixed with regret, jocoseness juxtapositional with a realisation that this bliss cannot last forever... 
But enough with themes, on to the shows central pillar upon which everything else is able to rest comfortably, the characters. And do not let first impressions sway you to believe that they are going to be moe fools splashing water on each other as the picture M.A.L has chosen to encapsulate the series would seem to suggest...  
Instead the characters, like the show are quite subdued and not in any rush to explain to the viewer who they are. One must also take into account that this is only the first season, and the real character development doesn't come until really the late second and third seasons, all the more aesthetically so for it, but here the ground work is set for the future masterpiece, every great work of art had to begin with a few basic sketches, a few simple outlines and in a similar way that is what is happening here. At first it may appear a bit jarring and one dimensional to see Akari's simple minded fascination with everything and her close friend  Aika's constant scolding of her wonder and ""embarrassing remarks"" or to see Alicia's (her senior) ever-present smile and gracefulness, but before long they become like reassuring kisses to your soul. Besides the show quickly makes it clear that these people are far deeper than a quick glance would suppose. I have already alluded to Akari's past and the possible reasons for her fascination and wonder at Neo-Venzia but there is also Aika and her struggles with her confidence and Alice their other undine friend who struggles with the stigma of being a child prodigy. 
But one thing all of the three main girls Akari, Aika and Alice have in common, besides their frustratingly similar names, its that they each have a senior who mirrors them in some shape or form, the original three ""water fairies"" as they are known, who guides them in their own unique way and whose friendships and past is similar, reminding one of what Mark Twain once remarked, ""History may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme""... 
To talk about the visuals and the music of this series is to do it a disservice, not only are the visuals stunning and the music divinely/hauntingly unforgettable, but everything fits so well with the atmosphere that you'd hardly even notice that music is playing or animation happening. I hate to beat a tired drum but i must stress that this atmosphere, is the show, this strange mix of feelings and wondrous healing aurora is only possible thanks to the perfect tone setting music, while portraying the themes of the series so vividly is only possible thanks to the exceptional art, showing us this man made miracle, this rusty but alive city… Speaking of the city, you might be wondering why even bother to set this series on Mars if your just going to have a quiet little character driven series with little to no sci-fi. Well I suspect that the extravagant setting was to allow for two things, more creative freedom without the constraints of being set in a factual Venice, and to allow the introduction of certain characters and idea's such as Akatsuki Izumo a character who lives high above Neo-Venezia in a floating city and works to control the temperature to make it habitual for humans, all in all it was a paramount decision that helped to create a masterpiece.  
To culminate, as with the past itself, Aria only gets better with age. Like some great golden tower it seems to rise out of its genre and set the bar for all utopian works. Making no attempt to disguise what it is or be what its not it sets its own pace and like a gentle breeze we are carried along with it. The challenges its characters face are not of a life threatening disposition and all the better for it, its love of the past and of man-made miracles provide a look into something we all feel but rarely discuss or think about. Like the beating of the tide against the buildings of venice or the rhythms of a poem, Aria seems to subtly ebb and flow between joy and sadness, future and past, the miracles of man and moments of magic, without ever losing focus of its characters or their hopes and feelings. And while Animation may be the weakest of the three seasons, it is only so because it must be, all that would eventually become a masterpiece is set-up here and the foundations of greatness firmly laid upon which its tower is built.  
Like the golden past we long for so much, Aria the animation isn't perfect, but it does open the door to future seasons, which damn well come pretty close…

Aria is often seen as the essential anime within the iyashikei sub-genre, which falls under Slice of Life umbrella. Before we talk about iyashikei or ""healing"" anime, we have to define Slice of Life. 
 Firstly, the genre tag Slice of Life gets used way too often here on MAL. Both School Rumble and Kino's Journey are tagged this way, despite being fundamentally different shows on nearly every level. On MAL, Slice of Life is used to refer to virtually any series that's not heavily plot oriented and doesn't feature tons of blood and boobs. School Rumble is a slapstick romantic comedy whereas Kino is a psychological/philosophical series. A slightly more concrete definition would be ""A naturalistic depiction of people going through a mundane period of real, everyday life"". While half the anime considered Slice of Life here are inappropriately labeled, Aria is a true Slice of Life anime. 
While the term ""Slice of Life"" is borrowed from the French language and many countries write these kind of plays, Iyashikei is more distinctly Japanese. An iyashikei is an anime or manga that not only lacks a central conflict, but all internal conflict as well. It's a series where everything is happy all the time and it feels like eating a bowl of cotton candy for dinner. For a Western audience, this seems like ""Care Bears"" kind of shit. Stories for adults and older teens are simply NOT written this way. Why does this shit exist in Japan? The answer is stress. Japan is not only one of the hardest working countries in the world in terms of number of hours, but also has extremely strict expectations. Japanese students from the time they're children go to school 6 days a week and study on average 4-5 times as much as American students. In Japan there is common phenomenon called ""kuroshi"" or death by overwork. It's also a country with historically one of the highest suicide rates in the world. In such a brutally difficult environment, iyashikei is a means of temporary escapism. You spend 30 minutes to an hour watching a show like Aria and your level of stress and depression is lowered enough to get back to work or studying. 
By describing iyashikei, I've already described a lot about Aria. The characters don't suffer from any psychological issues and don't need to go on a character journey of redemption or improvement. There is never an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Even Seinfeld has more conflict than Aria. Problem: George, Kramer, Elaine, and Jerry are in a parking garage and can't find their car. Elaine needs to get to the car quickly in order for her newly purchased pet goldfish to survive. George has a meeting with his overbearing parents, who will scream at him if he's late. There are stakes and consequences if the gang can't find their car in time. Aria is a pure utopia where there are ZERO stakes. Akari from Aria is absolutely perfect at her job, but if she wasn't it wouldn't matter.  
The plot of Aria can be summed up in a few sentences. It's the distant future and technology has solved basically all our problems. We can terraform other planets, overpopulation isn't an issue, war is a thing of the distant past, etc. Mars has become a tourism planet renamed ""Aqua"" that contains replicas of many of Earth's most scenic cities. Our story takes place in Neo-Venice and follows the lives of 3 girls who're training to row gondola boats and become tour guides. Each of the 3 young girls has a rowing master who trains them and lives with them. Gradually, the girls learn to become ever better tour guides and that's essentially the entire plot for all 3 seasons of Aria! 
So what makes Aria good? It's all about the details. Aria has a really soothing and beautiful atmosphere that's paired together perfectly with a relaxing soundtrack. Every single episode has at least 1 moving speech. Often it's about happiness or the nature of beauty or something along those lines. Aria is a very sentimental series and I mean that in a good way. While Aria was created specifically to soothe Japanese stress, it has found a large audience outside of Japan. Other countries also have stress and depression, so Aria can give a little relief to these people as well. As of 2019, America's suicide rate managed to finally catch up to Japan's. Keep in mind that Catholic, Hispanic Americans are lowering America's numbers. The suicide rate of Non-Hispanic Whites here in America has already surpassed the Japanese average by a significant margin. Maybe America needs less partisan news media and more Aria. 
I'll end by saying that Aria isn't necessarily a series for everyone. I've met a LOT of resistance from my offline buddies, who all seem to think it's boring as fuck. I can certainly see why they would think that and I don't mind when that's how people react to it. However, if you're feeling really depressed or stressed out and you want to watching something pleasant and peaceful, Aria is there for you!

    Story 
The story is unique, in my book. I mean, who thinks of making a slice of life on Mars. That's just really original and awesome. The episodes are slowpaced and deal with the daily lives of the undines, small discoveries, new friends and so on, all of it executed in a fine manner. Still, it was a little too slow sometimes. 
Overall I thought it was good. Nice colours, and good character designs. And the many shots of Aqua were nice. But I still got a feeling it wasn't perfect. I guess it could have been more detailed, specially the people and their faces. But it was pleasant still. 
This is just great, there is some soothing background music nearly all the time, and it gets you really relaxed. The opening and ending themes are also nice songs, that I never skipped. There are also a lot of insert songs, and when the undine Athena sings, it's just lovely. The voiceactors are great too. 
I liked the characters. No doubt about it. The undines were especially great, they were so diverse, and not to forget; funny. My favourite is Akari, the heroine, there are so many things about her that are memorable, and how she behaves with the other undines is hilarious. Aika and Alice are really funny as well, and the three fairies. I must say that the sidecharacters are good too, heck even the cats, even though I found them a bit irritating at first. 
Due to the show's slow pace, it took some time for me to get into it. But when I did, I liked it a lot. It's really relaxing to watch, with no action or drama, and such. Compared to most of the western media, this is really refreshing. 
A very good show, about daily life. Not much happening, but still great. If you want something different, watch this, and you're in for something good.

    Aria the Animation is not an anime for everybody. It's perceived as boring to many people, which is understandable. There is little action here and the plot is somewhat slow and aimless. There's also little moe compared to other slice-of-life anime. I should also mention as this IS set in a utopian society, there won’t be nearly as many sad emotions as happy ones, so those looking for a realistic anime should also not expect to find it here; Aria is blissful if nothing else. However, if you are in the mood to watch something relaxing and heartwarming, Aria the Animation would be a perfect choice. 
The setting takes place in the Utopian society of Neo Venezia, in the planet of Aqua, a terraformed planet filled with water. Though it does take place in the future and is classified as “sci-fi,” Neo-Venezia often feels like more of a past, halycon world. It centers on Akari and her friends Aika and Alice as they set out on their journey in becoming prima-undines, the greatest undines (or tour guides) in the region.  
The overall plot is not linear though trio do have a goal in mind (becoming prima-undines), it is not the prime focus of the anime. Rather, each episode is its own adventure, and by this I do not mean the kind of adventure like a hero’s quest to slay the evil dragon.  Instead, it is the adventure of Akari discovering the wonders of Neo-Venezia that are yet to be found. She meets new friends and experiences the many joys of friendship and the love of those close to her. Through its loveable characters and serene and idyllic environment, Aria the Animation manages to transform things usually mundane and perfunctory into something heartwarming and beautiful. Each episode leaves behind a warm, fuzzy (and inexplicable) feeling in your heart. Some also leave a hint of sadness as the trio realize that their lives currently filled with euphoria will not last forever. 
The characters in Aria the Animation are all likeable and fit perfectly in the anime, adding to its lovely atmosphere.  All the characters start their name with “A,” though I’m not entirely sure why. Though the characters are likeable, they lack relative depth (and little character development) and stick to their portrayed characters (to some people, to a repetitive extent). However, I feel as if this isn’t too bad of a thing, as Aria the Animation stands out for its simplicity and the characters add to that unique trait.  
The art in Aria the Animation was captivating, and was a considerable factor in what made Aria the Animation’s atmosphere so magnificent. The portrayals of the city and background were beautiful throughout. The amount of detail was consistently impressive, which is paramount to creating the impression that Neo-Venezia is a real place. In fact, the team in charge of creating Aria and its art traveled to Venice in order to create the most accurate depiction as possible; needless to say, they succeeded. Though there were some chibis here and there, the characters were generally nicely designed. And praise the lord, no moe in sight.  
A little downside to Aria’s art is that it’s not in high definition (at least not yet, perhaps the Blu-Ray will change that). And while this lack of video quality is limiting, it never prevents Aria from creating the vivid landscapes and magnificent spectacles that Aria is well known for.  
The soundtrack was amazing as well, and it blends well with the anime. The background music added to certain scenes helped maximize its effect to the fullest extent, and each piece of the OST was aesthetically astounding. The sound is one of the most astounding parts of the anime, and are of utmost importance in creating its atmosphere. The OP and ED were just some of the amazing songs, and after finishing Aria the Animation I would recommend checking out the rest of the album as well. “Rainbow,” in particular, is one of my favorite songs I have ever encountered in any anime.  
The setting of Neo-Venezia itself plays a fundamental role in Aria. As previously mentioned, the detail of the surrounding environment bring life to the picture, and the decoration of buildings and scenery in the background bring Neo-Venezia a sense of place. One of Akari’s greatest joys is learning more about the wonders of Neo-Venezia. As the audience, we follow her in her quest of knowledge, as we visit new places and meet new people throughout the episodes, we begin putting together the picture of Neo-Venezia. By the end of the trilogy, Neo-Venezia is nothing short of a fully fleshed-out world, leaving behind a certain touch of sadness as we experience the dreamy world one last time.  
Above all else, it is through its atmosphere that Aria works its magic. The result of a perfect combination of the plot, the setting, and the audiovisuals, the atmosphere of Aria makes it what it is. Aria is almost always cheerful and uplifting, warming the heart to its very core. Yet it is also calm and relaxing, evoking a sense of tranquility. This atmosphere is the inner core of Aria, but it is also what makes it a hit or miss series. You really have to “feel” the atmosphere of Aria to enjoy it, and as this is the case, Aria often comes off as soporific to those who don't feel the same. 
Aria the Animation was an amazing anime, and I greatly enjoyed it. I recommend it to those who enjoyed Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou or any slice of life fanatic. With its lovely character crew, stunning audiovisuals, and blissful and relaxed atmosphere, Aria the Animation gives you a feeling of contentment and tranquility. 
As I said before, don't expect to be at the edge of your seat in every episode, because you won't be. Rather, sit back and relax, as you slowly drift into the world of Neo-Venezia... 
I decided to end this review with a song that, while trite, I felt encapsulated Aria: 
""Row, row, row your boat, 
gently down the stream. 
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, 
life is but a dream!""

    Slice of life anime are difficult to represent to audiences in an entertaining manner without being a boring spectacle; that's why most of these have dramatic or romantic elements, or a lot of fanservice in them in order to be appealing to the viewer. But then there is Aria: The Animation, a slice of life in its purest form, that proves that such type of anime doesn't need any of the above to be succesful. Having dived in without any expectations whatsoever, I was pleasantly surprised: it was proven how wonderful and relaxing such a simple anime can be. 
~Story~ 
The premise of Aria: The Animation is of simple nature: Akari Mizunashi, a teenager who moved from Manhome to the planet Aqua (formerly known as Mars), joins the Aria Company to become a professional Undine - or a professional tour guide - in Neo Venezia, a flawless presentation of Venezia itself. This may seem as something totally uninteresting, learning how to become a undine, yet while it certainly is an aspect of importance, its main focus lies in the interactions with the people in the city, in addition to world building of the location. 
Another interesting aspect is the fact that it is a planet covered in water and while it gives the impression at first of being a simplistic and somewhat regressed humanity technologically wise, it is for the matter not: it is mixed with futuristic vehicles and devices such as gigantic airships, or flying machinery, whereas everyday tools are simple, which gives the viewer a feeling of attachment to the setting itself, as this may be something that would happen in the near future. Now it must be said that not much of the world and how it came to be is revealed, which will maybe be done in the sequels. 
As mentioned earlier, the story focuses on the different interactions with the people of Neo Venezia, and naturally fellow apprentice undines, as well as professional ones. It doesn't stop there: world building is done through the different, but intricate people of the city necessary to maintain a working society. Audiences may think that this anime has the approach of ""cute girls doing cute things"", yet with Aria it doesn't give this impression at all: they're just humans living their everyday life. These interactions are truly fascinating and heartwarming to watch, as it is in addition very relaxing as it also represents the ups and down life has.  
~Characters~ 
The cast of characters in Aria: The Animation is not big, and is by no means necessary; in fact, it fits well with the story to have a better and more realistic fleshing out of a handful of characters, than to have an excess of those. It must be mentioned that the fleshing out is limited and nothing outstanding, as well as character development itself. The characters are simple and have distinct personalities, that fits well with the setting and different relationships between the characters. 
What however stands out in Aria are the character interactions: these are very well presented, in a realistic and soothing manner. These are heartwarming and varied, nothing overly dramatic, which relay simple messages as enjoyment of the simple things of life, or realization of your own flaws through your environment and relationships with the characters. Which leads to other great aspect of the anime: the females are in no way sexualized, which is a huge plus to the anime. 
Other aspect that was really soothing and amusing to watch were said interactions: these were often witty and funny that managed to make me smile, and sometimes even blurt out quite often, which was something unexpected. These can be in addition quite emotional as well, as viewers observe how some of the characters are affected by their environment. What also struck me was the fact that the anime didn't seem to focus on Akari, rather her friends and companions as well. 
~Animation and sound~ 
The animation of Aria: The Animation (ha, animation) was well done, character movements being fluid, at times even being surprisingly well done. The art style itself is average, but fulfills its purpose well, having distinct character design and well drawn backgrounds that represented well the world and atmosphere the anime was trying to convey to the viewer. Another bonus is the smooth transition between the introduction and opening of the show, as well as the ending: it never felt an abrupt change. 
What however really stands out is the soundtrack used: besides the wonderful opening and ending songs that matched well with the story, were the individual OST's used. These were particularly of high quality to what the show was trying to convey, in addition to not being overused throughout the show. The voice actors performed their role well, matching well with the personalities of the characters and was relaxing to listen at. 
~Enjoyment~ 
What I initially thought to be a boring show about Venezia and how to become a undine, proved to be so much more interesting and relaxing than ever expected. The narrative and interactions with the characters, the humor and wonderful OST did a fantastic job to have a wonderful experience. The fact that it was no ""cute girls doing cute things"" type of show, in addition to females not being sexualized in any manner, was a huge bonus to the show. It certainly lacked in character development and having any type of story which I usually am no fan of, however the story set out what it meant to do. 
Some may wonder why I only gave it a score of only 8 despite all the positive things I mentioned in the review: this is mainly because nothing really happens, it is purely oriented on slice of life with no goal apparent. World building was a bit lackluster as well. I could recommend to anyone with an interest in the slice of life genre, just don't expect anything groundbreaking. 
Thank you for reading.

    Is Aria a good series? Probably. Does it deserve to be held up as a masterpiece? I doubt it.  
Aria tends to be hyped up as *the* epitome of slice-of-life, so I expected an anime with all the strong points of the genre, including fleshed-out, relatable characters. Aria fails in that respect, and that compromises the amount of enjoyment I can derive from this series as a slice-of-life fan who has no specific interest in cute girls doing cute things. 
What I object to isn't the fact that the cast is female-dominated, though more gender balance would have been nice. [The first half of Haibane Renmei, for instance, is an example of an anime with a mostly-female cast that rises above the ""cute girls do cute things"" formula, and manages to have some characters (not all, admittedly) with depth.] What I object to is the use of generic character traits and catchphrases as a substitute for actual characterisation. There's the sweet ditzy one, the feisty one, the -_- one, the sweet onee-san type... The characters are generally likeable - they're just not very interesting. 
My other main issue with Aria is that it is heavy-handed and mawkish. Other iyashikei series like Natsume Yuujinchou and YKK manage to be heartwarming without being horribly unsubtle, and have variations in mood and tone as well. For most of the series, Aria's mood setting is stuck on ""painfully sweet"". Conflicts are always easily resolved, and the characters cheerfully spout trite platitudes for at least half of each episode. The first time we get an episode with any sense of wistfulness or melancholy is episode 11, and that's far too late in the series. 
(President Aria also came across as annoying rather than cute, partly due to the irritating noises that he made.) 
As for technical issues: For the most part, Aria manages to look beautiful despite having occasionally clunky animation and slightly jarring CGI. This is partly because its backgrounds are largely copies of actual Venice (only a lot less crowded with tourists, lol), but there's some great art direction as well. 
The music is pleasant and well-suited to the gentle tone of the anime, but not outstanding. If you have a low tolerance for cutesy, unrealistic voice acting, this isn't the best series for you. 
If you're happy watching a sweet and fluffy iyashikei series, this will suit you fine; but if you prefer something that has depth, is nuanced, and has a gently melancholic mood, you're not going to find those elements in Aria.

    ""May this town's kindness reach the hearts of many people..."" 
From what I saw, I'm sure it will.  
The first idea I wanted to share in this review is that Aria is a series that speaks for itself. What I'm doing here is merely trying to explain a complex story within a few lines. I would never be able to summarize all the pros/cons of Aria, first because each person will see it in a deferent way, and second because you would need to watch it in order to understand all the comparisons, metaphores and symbolism I would mention.  
That said, I'm reviewing it with the sole purpose of bringing more viewers for this amazing chronicle and hopefully introduce more and more people to Aqua and its habitants.  
Aria is an anime that everybody should watch, still, it's not an anime that will work for everybody. Whether or not you will enjoy it, is up to you, your personal interpretation and the mood of the moment. I would say that what matters the most is the timing. If you watch it while in the mood for a thriller, you'll drop it even before understanding the idea of the story. 
""Now, please take my hand"" 
Is what you would heard from a radiant Undiine while boarding her gondola. With a gentle smile she would gracefully ask you where to and start conducing you trought Neo-Venezia, a city modeled after Venezia in Man-Home (Earth). She would show you turistic spots and you'd start to notice that even being in 2053 the city moves slowly, without traffic jams, rush hour, polution, cellphones, noise pollution... The only evidences that you are really in the XXII century would be the spaceships that are continually transporting passangers from one planet to another. This relaxed athmosphere would start to embrace you while the Undiine continue to show you wonders and misteries from this planet that were once dry and empty and is now filled with water and life.  
It's impossible to not enjoy such cozy enviroment. 
Every episode is a kind of fairy tale, filled with cultural values and a sense of friendship, always coming up with a poetic moral in the end. Aria stands out from the average and prove us that the essence of the Slice-Of-Life is not dead. Characters can be lovely and elegant without being ""moe"". All the great stories in human history never needed movies or TV series to be remembered, they passed from generation to generation depending only in the power of words and its storyteller. Aria didn't have a high budget, neither big sponsors, so the quality of the animation could never be compared to a ""top"" studio, even though, the artwork values itself from this modest simplicity, that even with a medium quality, brings you gorgeous scenarios and handsome characters. 
At this point you probably already noticed that Aria raise some questions a regular slice-of-life doesn't. This is only possible because of two main reasons: The already mentioned storyline progression, that works with a character-driven story and a ""not-so-linear"" time progression, and the well said characters.  
Usually what you see is a cast made of a group of high schoolers in a school enviroment, 99% of the slice-of-life stories are like this. Not saying they are bad, but it only provides a unilateral point of view from a given subject. Of course each character, if well planned, will have a difference in personality and see things in a different way, otherwise it would get boring to watch. Aria on the other hand change things in a ""macro"" way, and brings a entire community as characters. Works with different generations and people with the most different styles of life and personality traces, bringing to you a much more rich story  that resemble our lifes. 
It stays apparent whenever or not a studio made an effort to create something special when one of the basic points of a series steals the show. Financial issues or other external factors can put a ""barrier"" to graphics, effects, art, post-production development, but sound is relatively free from it. Music can be made by anyone, anywhere. Anonymous people can create masterpieces, and some kid can be playing right now a perfect cover of Beethoven. Why am I saying this? 
Because Aria's music deserve to be praised. Wonderful acoustic pieces by Choro Club and Senoo was the perfect match for the enviroment of the series. The entire OST is performed with string instruments (even a rhodes) without any kind of pop song or eletronic. The songs are slow paced, almost hitting a andante and sometimes a vivace, while the vocal collection are mostly ballads. It's undoubtedly the best choice of OST for a story with the values of Aria.  
Can you fell the nostalgia already? 
Aria made something special here.  
I wish not enter in the merit of originality but it is perceptible that after its publication, lots of other franchises started producing series which bended more to this side of a philosophical slice-of-life with tones of self-discovery on it. One could say the strenght of this series lies into two major standards. The fact that we all wish for hapiness and a calm life, and the philosophic notion that this happiness and this ability to see the wonder in things is already inside of us. You just need to find it. 
Being honest, I don't really mind that Aria is little of a underrated series. If it's like this, the amount of haters are minimal, there's no controversy around it, neither people arguing to see ""which is the best character"". The way it is, Aria will continue to be slowly recommended from friends to friends, just like in the pace of the anime itself.  
As for enjoyment, it sure hits the maximum score. Without any action scene or a suddenly twists in the plot, Aria still managed to amuse me every single episode. There's no way I would watch one episode and don't feel refreshed, all warm and fuzzy inside. Meaning-of-life anime? This is definitely one. 
I probably went full-philosophic in the last paragraphs, then for a closure to this review, a funny observation: 
Aria is not perfect. There's something pretty annoying on it, that will chase you from the 1st episode to the last of the 3rd season (...) 99% of the characters' names and/or last names starts with ""A"". Aqua, Aria, Akari, Alice, Alicia, Aika, Akira, Athena, Ai, Al, Anna, Akatsuki... 
It's pretty hard to memorize who is who before you get used to them! 
I hope I was able to introduce at least a little bit of this great story that is Aria. Now, the rest is up to you. 
""Thank you for choosing Aria Company. Have a safe trip! See you again!""

    I'M SORRY TO ALL YOU FANS OF ARIA BUT I FELT SOMEONE NEEDED TO GIVE TO OPPOSING PERSPECTIVE. 
I know a lot of people love this anime, but I just couldn't bring myself to like it. I gave it about 6 episodes to get good but nothing. 
Story - Um... what story? This show is a show about nothing, and not in the funny Seinfeld way. Nothing really happens from what I saw. Each episode has some type of strife occur, but there is no antagonist or villain of the sort. I'm kind of confused as to why it is so beloved. But to be fair you might want to give Aria a try, I just happen to dislike it with a vengeance.  
Art - A modern anime using modern technology and techniques, so nothing to complain about. It manages to live up to the current status quo, but fails to do anything amazing or innovative. 
Sound - Ehh... very laid back and mediocre. Fits the anime well, but doesn't float my boat. If you like the action music or romantic comedy type music, don't expect much watching this anime. 
Character - Everyone had the same personality. Well, to be more accurate, they had the same personality with slight variations for each character. All generally nice, good, people who are definitely getting a thumbs up from the man upstairs. 
I am a fan of Action-Adventure and Romantic-Comedies for the most part, yet I severely dislike this show. So if you like these animes you may not like this show, but I might just be weird and dislike Aria.

    Well I have to say the reason why I gave Aria a 5 it's mainly because I expected something way better than what I've just seen, the first episodes were slow which I thought it was cool but even at the end it was even SLOWER, i felt like it wasn't making any progress I had no initiative to continue watching, I felt like I've been wasting my time with this one. 
The good things about it would be the art and sound which were outstanding but that doesn't change my view on it neither. 
In conclusion: it's BORING

    I stumbled upon Aria years ago when reading a review about the manga and made a mental note to check it out later. Positively drawn in by Kozue Amano's original work, I soon picked up the anime as well. For a reason I still can't recall I dropped the show nearly three years ago, and it wasn't until just recently that I finished what I started back then. And though not much had changed for either better or worse from what I remembered, I'm glad I did so. 
Aria the Animation is not for you, who prefers a clear cut and classically constructed storyline that moves from point A to point B with some key events in between. Aria the Animation is not for you, who requires relentless action and constant fast-paced happenings from their anime. And most certainly Aria the Animation is not for you, who finds little to no enjoyment in just sitting back and watching as a close-knit group of girls, not in their bra and panties with guns ablaze, but with their gondolas and oars go through ordinary day-to-day activities instead of epic adventures and intense situations. 
But on the good chance you are the type to approach your anime with an open mind and the patience to watch and see the magic in the moment, you are likely to find the company of Akari, Aika, Alice, and the rest of the undines and undines-in-training much to your liking. Because that's what Aria the Animation is ultimately about: a journey to uncover the joy of the obvious, the excitement behind the mundane, and the possibilities underneath the sorrows.  
These scenarios are played out to us by a cast of characters who depict a variety of different personalities. Akari is the naive amateur who treats all she experiences with childlike wonder; through her most of the show's message is brought across to the viewer. . Aika is her best friend and almost her exact opposite: no-nonsense and feet firmly on the ground-kind of girl who constantly berates Akari for her dreamy ways. And Alicia is their mentor and the big sister-type of character, who's there to provide insight and help the juniors along the way. They're surrounded by a pack of friends who similarly have their quirks and qualities defining them and making their role contributing to what the creator is trying to tell us. 
You're right if you argue that the story is boring and seemingly pointless at times. Saying the characters being archetypes of their respective personalities (and almost exclusively female as well!) is cliche and overused is valid. Complaining that having cats as business company presidents is just plain stupid and ridiculous is justified. 
But as one who no doubt has already seen quite a bit of anime in their life, you have for sure come across these common failings before. And in case you've reached the point of having made peace with them, or feel like challenging yourself to do so, Aria the Animation may prove to be an eye-opening experience for you that anime can be good even if no heavens are pierced.

    I'm quite surprised that no one's actually written a review for this yet.  
I have to admit that I wasn't sure what to expect from this show. The synopsis didn't really give any clues as to what I should expect, and that is probably the best thing about it - it isn't quite what you expect. 
The story takes place on what used to be Mars (the first thing I didn't expect), in a place called Neo-Venzia (New Venice), and is about a girl training to be an Undine (the story uses the term to refer to a female gondolier rather than a water spirit). The story itself isn't linear in any way, as each episode is a story in it's own right. Normally this is a recipe for disaster in the anime world, but it works in this show - I'll explain why in a bit. 
The art and animation are of a very high standard, and the city and it's surroundings are beautifully rendered - and you will see a lot of the city in this show. The characters are very well depicted, even when they show their chibi side, and the best bit is there's not a panty shot in sight - hooray! 
The sound is one area where this show excels. Everything is there if you listen, from the sound of the waves to the hubbub of of a crowd. The music is ideally suited to the show and, unlike many anime, actually heightens the viewing experience. 
The characters are extremely well realised. I can't think of one character I actually disliked in the entire show. One of the things I liked about the show was how each character actually fits into the story, and the world in which they exist - even the cats have a purpose. One of the other things I liked was the use of fairytale and mythological creatures in the show. The females gondoliers are referred to as Undines, with the top three being called the Great Fairies. The weather is controlled by salamanders, the gravity is controlled by gnomes, etc. One thing that puzzled me was why the female characters names begin with A (except Grandma, however her real name is Akino), but that's by-the-by. 
So the important question is: Will you enjoy the show?  
If you're an action junkie, or into horror or angst, then this is not the show for you (although it never hurts to give it a try). This show is funny and quirky in many ways, without going over the top, but the one word I would use to describe the show is RELAX. It took me two weeks to finish this show and it's sequel (which is a long time for me by the way), and this is because this show is so relaxing that I was falling asleep whilst watching it. Normally it takes a lot for me to fall asleep, and even boredom doesn't work, but somehow this show just relaxes you to the point where you just drift off to dreamland without a second thought, and never once was I bored with this show. 
Overall this is a show that deserves to be watched, as it has a unique appeal that the like's of Sketchbook ~full colour'S~ and Kokoro Toshokan just can't quite match up to. The reason why the non-linear story works well in this show is because it's so relaxing that you honestly just don't care about the fact there's no real plot - which is a rather refreshing perspective to have. 
The best way to watch the show? Have a shower, have a good meal, get comfortable, and relax...

Oh, and this is more of a review for a whole franchise as I can't be bothered to seperate them. So the ""scoring"" of this review is also more of a whole franchise scoring. 
Well, aquatic world, and we get Undines who tour people. Thats basically the premise of this Anime. We got some chraracters who simply live their daily life to achieve the goal of becoming Prima Undine. Its a very positive, cheerful and heartwarming anime, thats how I would entitle this. I'm not usually fond of such anime as I cannot relate most of the time such feelings, thus why sesaon 1 got the lowest score from me, as it took some time to well, enjoy this anime. But as time passed I grew fond of the anime and well, somewhat distante gazed, longed for their positivity or any sorts of such beautiful feelings theyhad. Thus I more felt for them good. 
First season not much happens, we just learn about characters. Whilst second season offers a bit more progression towards their goal and third season wrapped up everything nicely. Third season also managed to tear me up at few scenes. Watching 3 seasons and simply enjoying their happiness from a distance is a tearful occasion for me. 
✦Art&Sound 
Simple art, but nice. Also loved the gag reaction faces, those were adorable. Scenery and the world was very nice looking. And absolutely loved the music. Very relaxing and soothing for the most part. 
Characters consist of trios. Main cast, their senpais and eventually their kohais. Main cast consists of very cheerful and happy girl, with soothing senpai. A quiet and odd girl who was my favorite and her clumsy and weird senpai. And third member is straight-man act serious girl with cute teary girl side and a very serious senpai that isn't the most feminine. Aside there there were bunch of side-kicks and somewhat nice side characters. Nice touch was that since there weren't that many characters it was nicer to grow into them. Also their growth and goals and finally achievements were such soothing things to look at. Very enjoyable characters. 
Anime that took time for time to grow into, but eventually I did quite like it. Very relaxing, enjoyable, emotional and soothing. Type of a ""mediating"" Anime.

    Seikai no Monshou is a must see for space-alien anime fanatics, of any age, despite that a lot of people do not like anime from before 2000. In my opinion, this show is great because of how successful it became, with two other full sequels and a bunch of ova's, specials, and movies to go along with. This series was fun to watch and easily got me hooked. As the story progresses, one can feel fully immersed in this space world, and even find themselves in relatable positions. The story is about a boy, Jinto, who is the son of the president of Planet Martine. When the planet is invaded by the Abh empire, the president gives up without a fight in return for nobility status; thus making Jinto a minor prince. His title is his saving grace in more ways than one... 
Story~7 
I can only judge the show based on this particular season without any bias from its' many sequels. This anime more or less always starts off with a 1-2 minute pre-intro in Abh language. It is a totally made up language, and dub or sub, I never got any translations. We have to use our imaginations for this part. Then the intro starts playing and it goes back into regular Japanese or whatever dubbed language it was supposed to be in. The anime has a major plot, with 3 main subplots that take up the entire 13 episodes. In my opinion, the 2nd arc was a bit lackluster, but it probably was put in to show the versatility/creativity of the characters. Still, it was just a three episode burnout, which is only really important for those who wish to complete the other sequels. 
Art~9  
The art was great for an anime in the “despised era” of the 90’s and early 2000’s; a time many people try to specifically avoid because the art style is too old. It is actually done very well, and depict the scenes of space and some of its inhabitants on other planets pretty well. It does use some of the cliché’s, like the cliché for women to wear short clothes, but main characters usually have a full-body suit. The ""humans"" are also drawn more feral, in an attempt to make the Abh look even better. The ships are the standard many space operas have used. The attention to detail was also an important aspect of the art for the anime, with even background depictions surpassing many anime of its time.  
Sound~8 
The sound is excellent. The music really sets the scene and helps with the tone of the show. The space fights are better than many other space operas, such as Outlaw Star. The speech of the characters is varied a lot, helping set the mood of the nobility, where different people use different dialects. An important “sound” is that important “Abh speak”. It helps create the idea that the Abh really are a different species altogether with their own language and customs. Other than that, the opening and ending themes are very memorable. 
Characters~8 
The characters really make the show. Jinto is from a planet resembling Earth, so his character is easier for the audience to connect to. This is in contrast with the space princess Lafiel, which makes the audience want to get to know her better, because of her royal blood, but desire for military prowess. The characters are all well developed, though some names might be harder to remember, because they are Abh of course. The only reason I didn’t give the characters a 10 is because of that one arc I didn’t enjoy all that much, mainly dealing with a baron of the Abh Empire. He was still a good character, but I felt that it would have been better if he didn’t have a whole arc to himself. The characters and their behavior still pave the path to understanding the Abh people. This is contributed by the depth of the characters, and their beliefs. 
Enjoyment~10 
Again, this is a must see for space opera fans. The entire Seikai series does an outstanding job of depicting a space age saga, probably comparable to the legendary Uchuu Senkan Yamato. I really did not expect to enjoy this anime so much, but the story was great, the characters even better, and just the idea of an interstellar romance was enough to draw me in. It is a great series that I would recommend to everyone. It was immediately added to favorites after completing it, because it was the building block for an even greater experience with the other series.  
Overall~9 
Since I still want to try to be objective, I’ll give it an 8.5-9. There were some things that could have been done better to make it a greater show, but there's no point in debating what could have been. It is a great anime that is worth everyone’s time and is easily a timeless 90’s space opera classic. If you must, just skip the first 2 minutes if the Abh speak confuses you too much. I don’t recommend it, but there were some times I just could not fathom what they were saying. If this anime is ever remade, I would love it for them to make the language more comprehensible to the public, but this anime is great just the way it is!

    This is .... truly something. 
This anime has some of the best character portrayals I ever saw. The story also wonderfully handles exposition and calmly shows the world and its aspects.... the creators even went as far as to write full language for the universe. Every episode starts with small exposition and backstory told in that language. Coupled with amazing music, the whole thing feels magical. 
So... why not 10/10? Well... there are few minor issues, and the anime is just too short. Only 13 episodes. When you watch it, it feels like you're seeing a beginning of something like another Legends of Galactic Heroes.... but then it is over. The ending is handled very gracefully, however. 
Details: 
Story: 8/10: 
This is about space, futuristic societieis, differences between those societies, and the anime wonderfully presetns the world. There are, however, few scenes and one episode that felt a bit forced , but that is the only problem. The anime spends plenty of time describing world, interesting theories/ideas used by it, touches details on differences between races, and in the end this effort pays off -- Everything feels real and alive. 
Art: 7/10: 
The art is a fairly good old-school drawing style. It is similar to maybe Magic-M66 or something like that. It does resemble Legends of Galactic Heroes in the way how it is executed. The problem is... I spotted some reused footage, and the ""awkward episode"" I mentioned in story section, felt like they had funding problems. So... there are few cost saving tricks noticeable. Aside from that, visuals look good, the actual style is somewhat unique, and nothing feels obviously rushed. Overall, I'd say that characters could use a tiny bit more detail, but for the purposes of this anime everything in the art style works. 
Sound: 7/10: 
Intro theme is magnificent and invokes feeling of awe. The issue here is that I don't really remember any track beside intro theme. They're there , and they do their job, and of decent quality, though. Voice actors are quite good, although I think there was only one famous name. Lafiel can sound a bit cold and indifferent, but that matches her personality well. 
Character: 9/10: 
This is where anime shines. Almost every interaction between characters is completely believable, and beautifully crafted. Every person feels alive, it is very easy to sympathize with pretty much everybody on the screen is believable and looks like a person. There are also no steretypical characters here.  
So... why not 10/10? Well, there is ONE subpar character in the show, which doesn't meet the quality standard by the rest. Thankfully, that character didn't get too mcuh screen time. 
Enjoyment: 8/10: 
Very enjoyable. Pacing is slow, despite some events, but watching it was very interesting. 
Overall: 8/10: 
I highly recommend to watch this anime. Character quality is truly something in those series, music is great, and story - and the world are interesting. 
Check it out when you have an opportunity.

    Studio Sunrise just pumps out anime. Also, there are two people to note of in terms of the Crest/Banner of the Stars anime (Seikai Series), and those are unknown director Yasuchika Nagaoka whom worked on all of the Seikai Series before going freelance, and original creator Hiroyuki Morioka. Notably, Morioka created an entire language with an alphabet (Ath) called Baronh just for the main alien race, the Abh. From 1999-2005 the Seikai Series anime went through 3 separate seasons plus an OVA to finish up. 
Seikai’s story focuses around a young man named Jinto. As a child, his planet was taken over by the Abh and his father negotiates that he and his son be given nobility status within the Abh in exchange for the planet, in simple terms. Quickly Jinto goes off to nobility school to learn the culture and language of the Abh. Upon going off to military school, which is custom for all Abh, he meets the young Abh Princess Lafiel. Of course, their ship gets into conflict with a developing war, and the story goes from there. 
Character designs are different to say the least. It tends to be a bit repetitive with the Abh, and humans are generally portrayed as Neanderthals. However, it does come with good reason. The Abh are a genetically engineered race that are supposed to look the same, while humans are meant to be portrayed as the inferior race. This also makes a point in the ways political conflicts are handled on both sides without giving away spoilers. Almost every detail in the Seikai Series has a point one way or another, and it’s done very well. From the opera music in this space opera anime, makes sense, to the written dialogue with not all races speaking the same native tongue, makes sense, the Seikai Series is an anime that really breaks boundaries on the typical sci-fi front. Even the romance is done well in how Jinto and Lafiel’s relationship develops from their first meeting all the way to the OVA. Next to the politics and space battles with subtle romance as a sub-plot, the only anime that comes close to this amount of detail is Legend of the Galactic Heroes. 
From the hard space action of Crest of the Stars, to the political struggle and war of Banner of the Stars, even the romance development and civil conflicts of the OVA, the Seikai Series is an anime of wonder. Pacing is constantly changing and mostly holds up from start to finish. Highly recommend to say the least.

    A master piece of an anime that is certainly lost in the time of the early 2000's. This series not only brings originality with story and the surrounding environment it also introduces the concept of love without the physical part. True emotional love and care between two characters in an all out war against humankind. Jinto is a well reserved and good manner male character that shows his lack of understanding of his environments and carelessness. Lafiel is a strong female lead that also has her own draw backs, but when the two face countless challenges and battles they make a perfect couple as each ones faults or strength makes up for the other. If you like romance, and space battles this little gem is for you.

    The very essence of cartoons is that they possess the ability to 'stretch reality'. In other words, to take an initial idea or assumption that we are all familiar with and then start pulling at it very hard. Taking that which is so clearly absurd and taking it to its logical conclusion. 
This is why cartoons and satire make for excellent bedfellows. Since after all, the latter is doing exactly the same thing. From Hogarth to Watterson, with Tenniel, Shultz, Uderzo, and Groening somewhere inbetween. Yet rarely if ever has anyone dared to make a good space satire. Animated or otherwise. 
Though it may seem at first glance a simple thing to do. After all the sheer preposterous of the genre might lend suggest that it seems ripe for a good ribbing. But good satire requires a certain sense of subtlety, at least to start off with. Not an easy feat when the story begins with spacemen from the planet Zog. 
There have been some noble attempts in the past, most notably Douglas Adam's sublime 'Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. Yet even then, an almost unrivaled comic flair (not to mention a quotability up there with Blackadder and Monty Python) is fatally undermined by an uneven narrative. ' 
Red Dwarf' on the other hand presents a much more conventional proposition. Being as it is a standard (albeit first rate) sit-com set in space, thus with all the jokes being references to the eccentricities and inconsistencies of its chosen genre. Thus what it presents in barrel laughs, it lacks in any sense of subtlety. 
Which is what makes the entire 'Crest of the Stars' series such an astonishing piece of work. Unquestionably the single finest  satire on the space (and/or space opera) genre that I have ever seen. All the great works from the Anglo-American tradition are put to the sword. Nothing is sacred, nothing is given quarter. 
I for one welcome our new Ahb overlords.

    Science-fiction has got to be one of my favourite genres. Some of my most beloved books are sci-fi, and it doesn't take much sifting through them to figure out what I like. I love the meshing of human and alien cultures; seeing how they interact with one another and how they compare and contrast is one of the most fascinating parts of those sort of books, in my opinion. Spaceship battles take a back seat – while they can be interesting, I have to be invested in the characters first. That's what psychology and the glimpse of a well-written and imagined society give me: grounds to care for the characters, relate to them, and become concerned for their fates. So when I heard that Seikai no Monshou, or Crest of the Stars if you prefer the English title, combined science-fiction, politics, and romance, naturally, I was sold. Unfortunately, the end result proved to not be so captivating.  
The series follows the main protagonist, Jinto, and his tribulations as he deals with becoming a nobleman of the Abh empire despite being a regular human. For the sake of simplicity, the Abh are basically space elves, although it's stated that they were descended from humans many years before. The second protagonist is Lafiel, a princess of the Abh empire and a full-blooded Abh herself. Naturally, one predicts they'll get together, but this is presumably reserved for later seasons. This one mainly focuses on the pair as they find themselves in the middle of a war between the Abh empire and an anti-Abh sect of humans.  
Jinto is a scholarly, reserved young man looking to fit in; Lafiel is a blunt but honourable young woman who also wishes to fit in. Both feel incompetent or useless in their respective societies and circles. As such, they are similar yet dissimilar, and that ought to be more than enough grounds for their interactions to be compelling and interesting. Unfortunately, they aren't; the way Seikai no Monshou pans out, their actions and turmoils are highly insignificant in comparison to anything else. I'm left feeling dysphoric and completely uninterested in what Lafiel and Jinto are doing – even bored. I usually have no problem whatsoever with slow pacing; indeed, I hardly notice it unless it is pointed out to me. Seikai no Monshou's pacing is almost as painful as trying to swim in molasses, and left me yawning distractedly as I wondered when the episode would end.  
One of the main problems the series has is that we have little to no reason to empathize with the main characters, partially because we hardly know anything about them. They simply react to the situations they are put into; as viewers, we feel detached from the action. To make matters worse, the anime pushes too many ideologies and too much information on us to be realistically manageable. This is usually achieved by a narrator at the start of each episode, reciting some explanations or historically significant event that seems, at the very best, loosely connected to the episode itself. I have no problem with politics and intrigue; in fact, I think it can be fascinating if done well, but Seikai no Monshou makes no effort to connect us to the information it is spewing at us.  
Let's get a book as an example, shall we? C.J. Cherryh's First Contact series is, in a superficial way, similar to Seikai no Monshou (part of the reason I was so eager to start the anime in the first place). The books are centred around a human male protagonist and his experiences and trials as he learns to coexist in a completely alien culture. Politics play a large role in this series, but it is interesting, because the main character is involved and affected by the goings on around him. Not to mention, he's also a pretty capable politician. Seikai no Monshou doesn't do this. Instead of making the main characters a part of the intrigue, allowing us to learn with them and make connections with events ourselves, we are treated to a cheap form of exposition that does nothing at all to make us empathize or sympathize with, well, anyone, really. There is far too much “telling” me things, and not enough “showing”.  
Luckily, episodes 9 and up are far more interesting and engaging than the previous ones. The sole reason for this is that Lafiel and Jinto actually get a bit of a breather and are able to interact with one another. In addition, they commingle with other people and have to figure out how to survive on a planet occupied by an army who does not like Abhs. That isn't to say that they didn't interact with people before; it's just that the majority of them were Abhs, and most of the interactions took place in spaceships. The problem, then, is that Abhs just aren't very interesting. I considered if this was because the Abhs can be thought of as quite “alien” and thus inaccessible, since they think vastly different from us lowly humans. However, upon further examination, I realized that this was simply not true. Plenty forms of fiction can make aliens different and perfectly strange, but still interesting. Thus, one's indifference to the Abh race can only be constituted as a product of poor writing.  
Despite all this, when the anime skips all the dreary exposition, the battles in space that just feel like a time filler, and the dull character interactions, it can actually be pretty good. It does a decent job of building up a general idea of the atmosphere in the first two episodes, and, as stated before, the final four to five episodes are truly enjoyable and do make me more interested in the rest of the series. Overall, though, it would be best not to get your hopes up too much. It's a childish and draggy show at its core. Hopefully, the remaining seasons will redeem it. Since the anime was adapted from novels, I imagine that they handle the topic and plot far better.  
Seikai no Monshou's soundtrack is quite good. Composed by Katsuhisa Hattori, it is very orchestral in nature and feels very “classical”. The opening theme is especially worth mentioning; it is a purely instrumental piece that is very pleasing to the ear and gets you excited for the episode to come, at least for the first couple times you hear it. The rest of the soundtrack, while more than satisfactory, tends to feel out of place in the grand scheme of things. It's rather as if the anime tries to feel more epic and sophisticated than it actually is. The ending theme is highly reminiscent of a ballad. Called Ushinawareta Aozora and performed by TimeSlip-Rendzvous, I personally wasn't too fond of it, but it's an acceptable bit of music. As for the voice actors, I didn't particularly find vexation with any of them, but I wasn't blown away, either.  
Sunrise's artwork is honestly very hit-or-miss. The colours are typically bland and not all that eye-catching. There are scenes where the drawings are beautiful, but those are fairly few. More often than not, the characters look awkward, overly kiddish (and by that, I mean the art makes it seem like the anime's demographic is six year olds), or just plain deformed. The spaceship designs are pretty nice, though. Simply put, the art does its job, and while it's mediocre at times, it can occasionally impress. 
Overall, Seikai no Monshou is an acceptable science-fiction show, and while it certainly won't have you on the edge of your seat, it's all right if you want to whet your appetite for aliens. What it doesn't offer is strong character relationships or an interesting plot, but it's all right for what it does. You could certainly do worse. Who knows, it might be the prelude to a truly epic tale that blows all the competition right out of the water – but for now, it's a pretty lacklustre start for the series as a whole. Tentatively recommended.

    Crest of the Stars is a tale of futuristic fighting between two factions: the ""alien"" race of the Abh and mankind. The Abh aren't necessarily alien as they are enhanced humans - they have altered genes that give them prominent features such as longer youth and blue hair. They were originally intended to be ""living machines"" to mankind but soon found independence on a space voyage for new planets to inhabit. They follow a imperial system, with influential families having elaborate names and taking top positions in the economy or military. Humans are split into 4 differ factions that ultimately make the United Mankind. A majority of the ones shown in the anime carry a grudge against the Abh. This is due to the fact that the Abh have gone from rebels seeking independence to galaxy conquerors. The Abh have military and economic dominion over the United Mankind. Now, in an ironic move, mankind seeks freedom and independence from those that wanted their independence. Despite this seeming like a good start for a story, the anime does not focus on the huge war taking place. The effects and some small fighting moments are shown, but they are not the main story. Instead, it takes a more personal look at two characters caught up in this war: Jinto and Lafiel. 
Jinto is a young boy who is the son of the Hyde star system's president. His father, Rock Lin, made a shady deal as their world was taken over by the Abh: rather than fight the invaders, he opted to become the territorial lord. This by effect made Jinto Abh nobility. Seven years after this event, he is on his way to a military college in the Abh's capital where he meets Lafiel. Lafiel also carries social influence - born in the Abriel family, she is a princess and the granddaughter of the Abh's empress. She currently works as a flying trainee trying to work her way up in the military. The anime follows the two trying to reach their destination only to be sidetracked by the war taking place - their tale turns from one of an escort mission to that of survival. 
Their personalities, as you would expect, are quite different from another. Jinto is more relaxed and calm, while Lafiel is serious and straightforward. The two protagonists form an interesting dynamic with each other. Due to her military experience, Lafiel is sharp when it comes to controlling ships or coming up with a strategic plan. Jinto is more aware of social cues and is able to help them keep a low profile in enemy territory or ease a tense situation. With personality traits like these, they have good chemistry with each other (that also hints at a bit of romance). The moments where they are alone and discuss what to do next are some of the better moments in the series. The talk may be a bit more formal, but their conversations always have a friendly delivery with each other that feels natural for them. Had this show been a character study in a more low-key setting, it would make for a great series. 
Unfortunately, this is not the case. Crest of the Stars still seeks to be a space opera full of grand bombast and wonder despite focusing mainly on two characters. Mixed between the relationship of Jinto and Lafiel are battle scenes and side characters that ultimately fall flat. This is due to not enough time being put on these elements. A show can't achieve a full complex environment in only 13 episodes and still spend a majority of its time on its two leads - some elements will have to be cut. This results in many of the dire circumstances feeling like ""misadventures"", such as when they are ""held captive"" by the Baron Klowal. Rather than fear for our heroes, I was ultimately watching as to when they will escape because of the lack of tension. The battles that Laimsairh and Spoor, two of the Abh ship leaders in the war, are involved in have no weight because we hardly know the opponent they're fighting. Additionally, because they interact so sparingly with the main two, it feels like episode fluff rather than seeing a smart or flashy military battle. Crest of the Stars wants to be a space opera but in reality is a romanticized adventure. 
Character wise, Lafiel is fine due to her straight shooter attitude, but Jinto can be a bit questionable at times. I at first (and still mostly do) found him to be a breath of fresh air in terms of a lead. He's not the manliest guy, but he doesn't overreact or make a big deal of the scene around him, making him more human than cartoon. This goes a bit too far in situations where there IS something to worry about - in other words, he underreacts. In scenes where death should be lurking around his corner, he is strangely calm and makes lighthearted remarks. I can give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's near fearless, but his relaxed attitude makes it so any scene wanting to be intense feels deflated. The other characters are eclipsed by these two, so characters that could be interesting like the ones in Marca's group or Laimsairh are sadly sidelined.  
In more general terms, the Abhs and mankind are also characters that can be faulted, but this is more of the way the show presents them instead of who they actually are. Some stories have very simple sides to choose (heroes vs. villains) while other stories like to show each side has mixed morals and ultimately either side is right in their means. Crest of the Stars wants to do both, trying to throw cries of independence and goodwill at both sides while making the humans have a more negative appearance (lying, violent propaganda) while the Abhs have a more positive appearance (graceful appearance, gentle yet firm speech). If this were a political piece, surely the audience would lambast this as strawmanning. Even the narrator's opening shifts sides, starting with an overview of the world before telling twisted tales of the Good Samaritan to bolster the Abhs. Though there's an argument for this show being imperial propaganda, I don't think it's as much imperial propaganda as much as it is bad directing/storytelling. It's much easier to write simple sides than to give each side its own reason for being good. Even shows like LoGH fall victim to this, albeit they do it in much less of a ""kneejerk"" way. Again, a lesser scope or more episodes can avoid this. Sadly, this is the end result. 
These last two issues are not as dire as the first (to me, it's worse to be not invested in a show than anything else), but are still some faults of the show. Of course, all of these faults could ultimately be due to the adaptation. The novels the anime was based on won a Seiun Award, an honor given to the best Japanese science fiction works of the year. The novels may carry more detail than what the anime can show, so perhaps it needed 2 cours to fully show off its potential.  
Visually, the animation is fine. It can come off as a bit on the budget side at times, but it looks decent in motion (especially in the faster paced-scenes). Adding to this is the good use of multi-tone shading, an older tradition that looks as great now as it did then. The character models can look a bit strange at times, with an odd curve in their skull (this is most apparent in Seelnay's appearance) but it stays consistent and there's really no off-models with the look. The soundtrack is very good, with big string sections and pleasant tracks giving the right mood to each scene. The ED, ""Ushinawareta Aozora"", is a catchy, nostalgic sounding sing-along and works great alongside the pictures of the two protagonists growing up. The voice acting is fine for what the show gives us - it's a formal setting, so formal voices are to be expected. A bit more passion from Jinto would and a slightly less annoying voice for Seelnay would be preferred, but they all do a good job playing their roles. 
Overall, I give Crest of the Stars a 5.5 out of 10. The truth is that Crest of the Stars cannot do anything Legend of the Galactic Heroes does better in the space opera genre. A show like LoGH covers a wider and more detailed look at politics, tactics and human behavior than Crest of the Stars does, even within its first 13 episodes. A made-up language and fancy names can only distract a viewer so long. Crest of the Stars might be liked if you want something more romantic, but otherwise I would avoid unless you are an avid fan of the genre tags.

    Okay, I'll make an attempt to be brief, but the stuff goes deep. I'll remark that I was not going to write a review here, but some stuff I saw in reviews here made me stumble a little bit and sit down to a keyboard. 
So, this anime is far, FAR from perfect. My major gripes are with animation quality and sound direction. 
1. Animation is very, very choppy at times. Many animations are clearly reused, others are not there at all, with static images instead of moving objects or whole scenes. Yes, clearly, those are the result of budget being to small. but this is till an issue. Luckily, art style and great visual design pulls the series off this pitfall, making visual aesthetic do the job. 
2. While the soundtrack itself rather good,consisting of epic orchestral compositions suitable for imperial scale of the setting and the Cosmos itself, with some more melancholic or cheerful themes here and there, it's often misused, with sappy melodies over already too sappy moments. The result feels too tryhardy and kinda unnatural, taking away instead of improving the atmosphere of certain scenes. Luckily, it's not too commonplace, but the stuff is there. 
3. I will be silent on English dub, because oh Warp, English dub; this should be watched in Japanese. But there we have Jinto, the protagonist. It seems seiyu was not told his character is a 10 years old boy only in several scenes, not in *all* of them. His voicework just does not fit the character we see. Yes, Jinto can be sloppy, overly emotional, shy etc., but he still is a young man of decisive nature, who is absolutely able to create commanding presence. The guy who voices him cannot, though. And this is a huge failure. 
4. The director really, really likes to remind stuff to the viewer, and to place scenes out of order. While in some cases it does work, for the most part it just breaks the pacing, especially when SUDDEN flashback - preferably to something we already saw - breaks an interesting conversation. These get rare as story progresses, but episodes 1 to 3 are a complete mess. 
I'd say these issues would kill any media product from me, but in this case we have such an outstanding *rest of stuff*, I cannot even lower the overall score despite what I just said before. 
First and foremost - the storytelling here lines up with classic, more ""hard"" kind of sci-fi. You won't see robots with swords or schoolboys shooting beams of light out of their... somethings. There are people who do their jobs using technology. There are societies, that exist and evolve, and interact separately from each other. Those societies have their interests, goals and ideals some or most of their members pursue, forming cultures and ideologies that are doomed to clash. Those cultures manifest in all spheres of life - architecture, cloth, traditions, technologies, designs etc. 
The driving force of the story is a paradox of an expansionist empire. A romanticised vision of Prussia, ancient China, Russian Empire or early stages of forming of USA. How does the empire expand? What does it do to its subordinates and conquered areas? Can an expansionist empire be the force for good? The authors clash several empires in a battle, with motives and methods of each being clear. 
We have Abh, formed from artificial slave labour rebelling against their slavery to form a space-faring machine of expansion, with final goal of ending of all wars. We have classic humanity, which is losing the expansion race of post-diasporal unification. Can we blame Abh, actions of which are dictated by their own nature? Can we blame the rest of united mankind for creating them, and then despising and fearing them? Humanity is afraid of Abh expansion for a reason, but they lead their own expansion as well. Whose expansion is more righteous - Abh, mankind, both, neither? Whether your personal outlook on subject matter - can the opposing faction be completely dehumanised in order to achieve victory? In history of mankind there were no wars without dehumanisation of opponents; it is in human nature to explain killing of your own with them not being humans for one reason or another. The Abh are a fantastic assumption as of itself - they do not treat their enemies as non-humans. On the contrary, the centrepiece of Abh philosophy is based around humanity of both their enemies and themselves. Notice the way Abh engage with the lands they've conquered: whatever their leaders say, they do one thing: remove defences, remove ownership of interstellar spacecraft, forcefully open trade. And that's it. No other policies are fed upon the populace. United mankind acts... Just like mankind does, aren't they? Ideological opposition is eliminated, separatist movements are destroyed, wrongthink is forcefully ejected by expansive propaganda, and after THAT all the freedoms and democratic way of life are the topic of the day. Whatever country you live in - I assure you, this is the way things are there. It can be done in a more fine way, or brutforced (like where I live), but it is there. All of it. 
This is why the Abh concept is so interesting: what if such an entity existed? How would it operate? It's still populated by humans, so they still have their own motives, characters, wishes, dreams and goals. Can the culture to nurture the idea of humanism as its foundation even exist? 
You can also draw parallels to Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers with Abh. ST is often considered to be a pro-fascist book, which it isn't. In actuality systems described by Heinlein are active in most societies with access to election limited by several barriers. In this case the imaginary social structure is vastly different and built around a meritocratic feudalism, whatever I just said. As any imaginary concept, this one can barely be supposed to work, as it provides far, far too many ways for abuse, but luckily in sci-fi we have such a beautiful thing like fantastical assumption, which allows Abh history to occur and for Abh empire to be believable. 
But what makes CotS to be really great is its ability to say ""To hell with it"" - and instead of being a philosophical work in guise of sci-fi, like Heinlein's work, it is actually a personal story of people in this implied scenario. The story creates likeable characters with interesting backgrounds. Of course, the centre of attention is the Empire (it's still the thought experiment, don't forget) but what we follow is the growing and maturing of people within the researched culture, instead of direct cultural analysis as it is. Jinto, Lafiel, imperial admirals, nobility, commoners, land livers and United Humanity representatives - they all are interesting characters first and foremost, and only afterwards they are the tools of author's idea. This is where the good stories are born. And this is why CotS and its sequels are so great to watch. You can easily ignore the large scale stuff and watch the story of growing up of interesting characters in fantastical environment - or you might want to dig deeper and engage the ideas presented here. 
It's sad some reviewers either miss the point, or even outright cross CotS out for exactly what science fiction as a genre exists for - allowing unusual, unbelievable concepts based on reality but impossible within it to come through the prism of author's imagination and be shaped into piece of art.

People often have vastly different upbringings. While there are obviously certain positive or preferred ways in which to flourish, occasionally, given the situation, such luxuries cannot be granted. Sometimes it's entirely based off of financial standing or the location where one lives. Other times it's based off of racial or ethnic disparity. But no matter the case, it is almost always outside of one's control. And so it becomes less about how the world sees you, and more about how you see yourself. Such is the anime Crest of the Stars, a simple beginning to a galactic journey. 
Crest of the Stars places Jinto, a young male Terran-turned-Abh nobleman, into the spotlight. Before making his way to the capital of the Humankind Empire Abh, he is greeted by the heir to the jade throne, Lafiel. But before they can make it home, an unexpected event occurs. 
The anime purports itself to be one about romance and space. But it becomes quickly apparent that the ideas and focus regarding the universe take precedence over the development of Jinto and Lafiel's relationship. In this way, the show is often aptly described as ""Spice and Wolf, in space."" And that's a compliment; while the character dynamics between our hero and heroine are looked at less than the world-building (galaxy-building), what is given is not to be scoffed at. Their adventure sees them come together, with protecting, quarreling, helping, annoying, caring, bickering, and understanding being rampant throughout. While it isn't actually romance, it's a start, for before a couple can be lovers, they must first become friends. 
Hearkening back to the galaxy-building, this is perhaps Crest of the Stars's strongest point outside of the relationship between Jinto and Lafiel. There are a ton of different pieces of information given throughout the show. For example, there is an entire language specifically crafted for the Abh; factoids about the Four Nations Alliance and their tense relationship with the ""Kin of the Stars;"" scientific offerings in terms of measurements, space-travel, and technology; exploration into the Abh's culture and way of life; and minor yet intriguing pieces that round out the experience. It's done adequately enough, not feeling too overwhelming while still maintaining its own, unique identity. 
Where the anime begins to misstep is in the events that take place, or more specifically, their importance. The show is roughly sectioned into two parts: a quarter of which deal with large-scale war skirmishes and the remaining focusing on Jinto and Lafiel's escapades. But where the macro instances hold both literal and figurative weight, the micro ones do not. That is, the main couple's actions never feel as if they mean anything, in any regard. Whether it's fighting their way out of a Baron's domain or hijacking a vehicle to make it to the nearest city, their mark on everything that is going on around them is significantly smaller. Now, the purpose of placing so much emphasis on the two makes sense; the idea is to establish, explore, and eventually enact the relationship between Jinto and Lafiel. And while their relationship was done nicely, the events around them were not. 
Crest of the Stars also misaligned itself in regard to its overall focus. Here, the show at first plays with the idea of our characters being ""birds trapped in cages."" That is to say, their free but restricted in what they are capable of doing. Despite winning the hierarchical lottery, what the anime depicts are two young adults struggling to deal with a universe that looks at them for what they are, as opposed to who they are. And that's vastly interesting...but is sadly dropped. The show goes from showcasing Lafiel's interracial distance and Jinto's unfair discrimination to more action-oriented scenes and having Jinto ""find his place."" It's an awkward transition, mostly because the former thematic direction was well-crafted but is suddenly forgotten and replaced with a more general message. 
The best way to describe Crest of the Stars's art and animation would be a ""mixed bag."" 
The art for the anime can be rather pleasant at times. The battleships, the star systems, the surface of planets; there are a multitude of different areas that are explored, each providing an appropriate mood for the given situation. The inside of the ships match the blue-hair of the Abh; outer space is dotted with stations and stars; and amusement parks, city streets, and forests are interspersed throughout the planets. At times, though, the anime uses this strange filter to give the effect of light or brightness that deters from the visuals rather than supports them. 
The character designs follow a similar trend. The Abh are beautiful and regal, with their pale skin, sharp eyes, and distinctly blue hair. Lafiel fits this description, but always sporting her military outfit. Unless, of course, the situation demands a change. Jinto dons similar attire, with a white-and-red cloak, brown, parted hair, and various costume changes when appropriate. The largest issue comes from their often irregularly shaped heads and jaws. It can, like the filtering, be wholly distracting. 
Actual animation is normally average to above-average. While there is a lot of talking and sitting -- at dinner tables, in a shuttle, or within a strategy room -- characters are usually moving or reacting to the words and sentences being said. Furthermore, the aforementioned battles demonstrate their prowess, with huge explosions, lasers, missiles, cruisers, and gunfire going off at all times. 
Crest of the Stars, while involving space and war, is still an anime about our main duo: Jinto the Terran and Lafiel the Abh. 
As a descendant of the Abh, and especially of the royal family line, Lafiel finds herself in a precarious position. Direct yet respectful, she can normally be quite ignorant of the emotions and customs of non-Abh people. This is easily attributed to her race; they are taught to ""move forward"" when making decisions, are usually apathetic towards other species, and keep themselves away from non-Abh prevalent areas. But due to her logical reasoning and knowledge of the rest of the galaxy, she is able to support Jinto through the first half of their perilous adventure. And while she finds that completing one's mission is admirable, she wishes she could do more. That is, she looks at herself as being ""useless"" in the grand scheme of things. The attack on Gosroth, fleeing from ships encircling the planet of Sufugnoff, getting exhausted from an absurd amount of running; despite demonstrating her prowess as a capable woman and an amazing friend, she still believes herself to be bringing those around her down, or at the minimum, not contributing enough to the efforts at hand. However, Jinto believes otherwise. 
Jinto was born and raised, for a time, as human. However, following a betrayal by his father towards their home planet, Jinto technically became a nobleman in the Humankind Abh Empire. Extremely caring to those around him and rather witty, he often finds himself being ""useless"" as well. More so than anything else, he feels useless alongside Lafiel. Not being able to console her during times of grief, taken hostage, unable to man spacecraft; he's described as nothing more than a ""commodity"" that needs to be transported from one area to the next. But he moves from being the helped to the helper come the second half of the anime. This movement, where the roles are switched between Jinto and Lafiel, also occurs with a shift in location. They go from Abh-controlled territory to United Mankind dominion, and subsequently Jinto becomes the leader. And after having been the one in reliance and the one relied upon, he discovers that everyone goes through what he has. That people hold ""strengths and weaknesses,"" that everyone is a ""bird in a cage."" Everyone needs aid from time to time, whether you're a noble count or a royal princess. It makes no difference, for when one's weaknesses are at play, he or she must lean on someone's strengths. In other words, someone else will bring the key, open that birdcage door, and set that bird free. 
Looking at both Jinto and Lafiel, both here and within the anime, it becomes evident: they're ""the same, but different."" It's not just about him being a Terran and her being an Abh, it's in the way they carry themselves, how they're perceived, and what they know of their counterpart's culture. In short, they learn from each other over the course of the show. Jinto realizes the difference between killing and protecting, and that there are times when one has to face danger head on. For Lafiel, she comes to understand that the logical choice isn't always the correct path; sometimes you have to do what's right instead of what's right. Beyond learning from each other, they learn about each other, too. Their various customs, lore, and upbringings allow them to connect with one another more so than with anyone else they have known their entire lives. And that's what Crest of the Stars accomplishes: creating the start of a dichotomous, trusting, and loving relationship. 
The OP is quite orchestral in its composition. The track begins with hard drums and violins, leading into a fantastical arrangement with that strange feeling of space permeating it. With more trumpets, violins, and high and low points, the piece ends in mysterious fashion, making it a nice fit for the show at hand. 
The ED is one of the most 90's songs I've listened to in quite a while. The slow piano and simple acoustic guitar playing fill the background initially. The vocalist is ""by himself"" for the first half, but when the second half kicks in, a common drum-and-cymbal beat appears alongside the, ""I wanna fly away!"" lyric. Coupled with the ""oh-ohhh-oh"" singing and its general slowness, it can actually be quite catchy to listen to. 
The rest of the soundtrack mostly follows in the OP's footsteps. More space-like pieces filled with trickling instrumental effects and violins; flute and low-keyed piano ones during more tense situations; chimes, flutes, and violins in unison follow the more thoughtful moments; and guitar and drums when battles are underway. Each track fits well during the scenes in which they are played, but sadly, none are impressive on their own. 
Voice-acting-wise, everyone involved performs in or around average. There are no special shout-outs to be had. 
With romance as my favorite genre, I went into this one expecting to see a good amount of it. But as it went on, and as was already detailed somewhat, it was not about romance; it was about leading up to romance. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It was great to see Jinto and Lafiel risking their lives to save one another on numerous occasions, despite having only met a few days prior. And honestly, anything beyond what they gave near the ending of the season would have been too much, and would have betrayed what the goal of the anime was. Which, reiterating once more, is starting their relationship. In the following seasons, I'll be awaiting to see their blossoming romance unfold. 
The war and the fights, both in space and on land, were fun to watch at times, but not nearly as interesting as Jinto and Lafiel's dynamic. There, it would be funny at times, with Jinto making jokes with Lafiel and her being rather fun herself, despite her background. 
As a final note, Dorin Ku, Jinto's only friend back on his planet of Delktoe, had a surprisingly well done segment; from his ten minutes of screen time alone, he was able to personify the epitome of ""best friend."" Which made it a shame to see him leave as quickly as he appeared. But as a final negative, there were too many ""100 vs 2"" moments, breaking some of the ""reality"" of the situations that took place. 
Crest of the Stars is an anime featuring racial disparity, space wars, and an interesting couple. While the story and animation are lacking, the characters and music help to alleviate some of its shortcomings. But this is just the beginning of Jinto and Lafiel's relationship, and subsequently the beginning of the series. Hopefully, what is left in store will be able to pick up the slack. 
Story: Fine, ""Spice and Wolf, in space,"" adequate world-building, weightless events, thematically lost 
Animation: Fine, nice art style, weird filter, okay character designs, good actual animation 
Characters: Good, Jinto and Lafiel begin their dichotomous, trusting, and loving relationship 
Sound: Good, good OP, nice ED, good soundtrack, average VA work 
Enjoyment: Fine, not enough romance to my liking, some fun writing here and there, they win too many clearly stacked battles 
Final Score: 6/10

    In the far future, mankind is on the brink of entering a galactic war with the alien race Abh, as earth is preparing for battle, without firing a single plasma beam, their leader Rock Linn surrenders. In the middle of all this is Jinto Linn, the cowardly leader's son whom is only at the time 10 years old. What will become of mankind after its conquering? Will the human race be destroyed? Who are the Abh and what are their intentions? These answers and more in the beginning of the epic Seikai saga! 
The main story begins 7 years after mankind’s surrender to the Abh. Jinto is now 17 years old. During the last 7 years Jinto was on Planet Delct, training for the Abh miltary as well as learning the Abh language. While departing, he meets the beautiful young female Abh solder Lafiel. Little does Jinto know, but Laifel is the future princess for the Abh. What we get out of the main story is not only adventure, romance and action, but international space politics that show the problems the nations are going through and what they want. Not many anime do this. If you are interested in an all action show you will not get it here. Yes there is great action, but most of that is saved for the sequel. This anime has a lot of dialog, but its not boring or pointless. 
Art  
The artwork for crest of the stars is done well, even though it looks like how most  animes in the 90s did. Where the art does well is the atmosphere. It feels very misty and dream like. The backgrounds on the space stations are creative. The art gives you a feeling of a living breathing world. 
The music for crest of the stars is great, and help makes the show feel like a real scifi epic. (which it is) The opening song is a tribute to classic SciFi shows of the 1950s and 60s gives the viewer promise of adventure and wonder. The space battle music pumps up the action well, music and background music for calmer moments are at times dreamlike, it fits the space mood very well 
The characters are very well developed, this is due to the many long conversations in the story. Jinto is put into a unique situation, but he is relatable since he is the only major human character. Laifel is the fan favorite, and she does not act like a wishy washy disney princess who just wants more of everything. She is logical but not a genius, she does what she thinks for her country. There are many more characters in the Crest of the stars saga and her sequel, and some are are as developed as Jinto and Laifel.  
Crest of the stars is a great anime with a interesting story and superb character development. Its a shame it did not receive the attention it deserves in western countries. I blame this on the bad marketing bandai had as well as the bad English dub. (watch with Japanese subs) If you are into scifi, or just want a good story with good characters check out Crest of the stars.

    Crest of the Stars is a show that starts off with such great artistic promise, and such effortless mastery of the art of storytelling, that it might seem downright insane of me (or anyone, for that matter) to ultimately award it a score of 1. The problem then, is that it presents a distorted  picture of its own premise, and it isn't until close to the very end that it reveals itself to be something that's shockingly nasty and horrifying, and in a way that makes its artistic accomplishments come across in extremely horrible taste. And till then, it comes across as an especially charming and thoughtful show, carrying you along for a rather fascinating ride through its strange and curious world. But as I now intend to explain, it is this very ""journey"" that is a misdirection, and one carried out in unbelievably bad faith. 
The show introduces a very intriguing concept - a race of genetically modified space-faring humans called the Abh, who are long-lived, youthful-looking and generally confine themselves to space colonies rather than live on terrestrial planets. These Abh have advanced far ahead of ordinary humans by utilising their genetic modification technology and the freedom of their space habitats to create a population of humans who are superbly adapted to even the most challenging conditions in space, and virtually never age until very late into their lifespans. Their society is also unbelievably permissive, where they can breed with just about anyone with the help of artificial wombs. 
On the other hand, they are shown to be territorially aggressive, invading terrestrial planets where the regular humans (called Terrans in the show) live, and claiming them as territories of their Empire. They don't even want to live there (they seem to prefer their Space habitats), but they nevertheless exert their authority over the planets, going to the trouble of toppling the existing governments in place and appointing Terran puppet figureheads to rule on their behalf. This much is verifiable fact. This is also the premise around which the show revolves - just who are the Abh really, and why do they act this way? To demonstrate where they go with this premise (and ultimately get to WHY I'm denouncing this show in such strong terms), I'll need to give at least a general outline of the plot, but I'll try and describe only the broadest strokes, without giving away any spoilers: 
In the beginning, the show focuses on the atmosphere of political upheaval caused by the Abh invasion and takeover of governance in a planet called Martine. Subsequently, we get to see the effects of this change on the fate of a young boy (our protagonist, Lin Jinto) caught in the middle of all this, an unwitting pawn in the game. Due to various events, he is thrust into a position of civil service, and is awaiting transfer to Abh country for further education and training. Here he meets our other lead, Lafiel Abriel - an Abh cadet assigned to escort him - and they develop a spontaneous but believable cameraderie and friendship. The stage then shifts to the inside of the Abh spaceship transporting them, where Jinto gets to meet the Abh in person for the first time, and through his interactions the audience gets to learn of their strange and curious ways. It's full of interesting little details that add a sense of charm to the whole thing. 
Then, the ship they are travelling in is put in danger, and the focus shifts to the immediacy of the situation - how our leads are going to survive and reach their destination to carry out their duty. This setup makes for some genuinely gripping adventure, that carries this show into about three-quarters of its 13-episode length. The scenes are genuinely tense and suspenseful, and you really don't know what to expect next. And through all of this, you have gradually come to care for the two leads. They seemed really likeable to begin with, they are put through all sorts of danger, and then really come through for each other in ways that you can't help but be moved by. And so you find yourself caring about what happens to them when they finally reach their destination... 
And it's here that the show delivers its killing blow: the trials and tribulations of our young heroes are ultimately relvealed to be nothing more than convenient plot devices to showcase the baseness and cruelty of the Terrans opposed to Abh rule. They are shown to be deeply envious of the eternally youthful and long-lived Abh race, and want to subject them to their own dominion and make them their slaves (I swear I'm not making this up). Any humans who are less than enthusiastic to the idea of Abh dominion are portrayed as grotesque caricatures of spite, envy, prejudice, greed, selfishness and cruelty, and even their visual portrayal looks obnoxiously cartoonish and ugly. And the Abhs, in contrast, are made to come off as larger-than-life beings who could do no wrong (unless of course they have half-human ancestry...), and they are accordingly animated to look stately and elegant, with their elf-like features, blue hair and proud but noble bearing. The show goes out of its way at every turn to illustrate how impeccable the Abh are in their character, and how even do-gooder humans are inwardly driven by rather unflattering motivations. 
In short, it becomes increasingly clear that all these exaggerated portrayals were in the show's way of justifying the Abh's entirely unprovoked aggression on humans - some of whom weren't even aware of their existence, let alone be on hostile terms with them - all the while shifting your attention to the immediate danger facing the two leads. And consequently, you realize with shock and horror that all those seemingly nasty and unfounded things the Abh-haters said about them earlier on...were actually true. There is one scene in particular early on, where an old woman is overcome with an inexplicably hysteric reaction of sheer loathing and even dread, just at the mere sight of an Abh. In the context of the show's later developments, this reaction suddenly makes a frightening amount of sense (just imagine how it must feel knowing that the very same overlords you've known and loathed since your childhood are still young and strong, and will very likely outlive not only you but your children and grandchildren as well). And in the face of this, the show insists that the Abh are humanity's only real hope - on one hand, it tries to pass off all their horrifying actions as extremely smart moves that are beyond the understanding or appreciation of lowly mortals; and on the other, it tries to suggest that their enemies are actually driven only by bitter jealousy of the Abh's apparent ""greatness"" and superiority. 
An important device for furthering this illusion is the show's own narrator, who speaks in Abh-language with an air of lofty detachment. At various points throughout the show, he plays the role of providing historical context to whatever is being depicted on-screen. But as the show progresses, he starts inserting one sneaky insinuation after another into his narration; until by the end, he is quite explicitly showering unconditional praise on everything Abh, and utter contempt for all Terran institutions. The show also executes another crafty sleight-of-hand to maintain the audience's sympathy towards its protagonist - through the course of the 13 episodes, it subtly shifts from portraying Jinto as an unwilling hostage of the Abh system, to a regular Earthling helping a stranded Abh out of ordinary decency, to an outright Abh sympathiser who implicitly approves of all the atrocities they would commit in the name of a ""wronged"" people, to a full-fledged member of a nobility that is subjugating his own home planet. And in the end, the show would have you believe that it was the humans (including his father, among others), rather than the Abh, who were the cause of his misery and hardship. 
And then there's the Abh themselves - initially portrayed as romantic star-faring gypsies dragged into a war they didn't want (""Kin of the Stars"" is what the show poetically calls them), they are subsequently shown to be brave, chivalrous and decisive when pushed into battle...until somewhere along the line you realize that all the Abh you get to see are in fact soldiers in some or the other capacity, and their entire society is in fact organised along militaristic lines. The show has an enigmatic and bombastic prologue scene depicting the Abh fiercely engaged in what appears to be an epic and heroic battle for their lives - but all they were actually doing was destroying the defences of an unwary and ill-equipped planet that barely even knew of the Abh's existence. Quite the heroes, these guys... 
Now let's just say that none of this really matters to you, and all you want to know is if this is an enjoyable show on the simple level of an adventure story, or perhaps a romance. Whatever the angle with which you may initially have approached the show - be it sci-fi, politics, drama, romance, or whatever else - in the end you'll find that your hand closes in on empty air. Why do I say this? Because when you get to the last couple of episodes, all the show's initial promise of thematic exploration and character development is crudely cast aside, because it's time to push their ultimate aganda. You can see this for yourself - the plot regresses into something jaw-droppingly preposterous (that is, until the conclusion, when the intent becomes sickeningly clear), and the characters are reduced to being zombie mouthpieces for the author's ideology. The transformation is quite shocking and hard to miss, and it's at this point that you're suddenly snapped awake, and suddenly become aware of the underlying immorality of the whole thing. 
On a technical level, the show is extremely accomplished at evoking just the right kind of mood and ambience. The visuals are low-key and present an air of nocturnal tranquility, both in the surface worlds and in space (though in the later episodes it goes for the opposite effect). The music is equally serene, and has a distantly operatic feel. But that's precisely what makes the experience so jarring when you get to those last few episodes - the disconnect between the horror that's being shown on screen, and the way the show expects you to feel about it, induces a feeling of disorientation and nausea even at a basic sensory level. It's not an experience I'd recommend, to say the least. 
As for the characters - Jinto initially comes across as an innocent and unwilling pawn in a game that he had no control over, but in the end you get to see his fawning admiration and sycophancy towards the Abh, to the point that he counts himself as one of them, and overlooks the fact that they are in fact invaders and unlawful rulers of his homeworld (I can only guess he will end up fathering another patricidal Abh in his own turn...) Likewise, Lafiel also initially comes off in a similarly sympathetic light as someone who is grateful to someone who saw her for the individual she was rather than for her status in Abh society, but by the end you see another side to her - a blindly self-righteous aristocrat who notes how her people were wronged in the past, but thinks nothing of the atrocities and injustices that her own people are committing on innocent populations. Ultimately, her purpose in the show is revealed to be that of a Starship Troopers-variety ""Paragon Soldier"", existing only as a mannequin model to exemplify all that is supposedly ""noble"" about the Abh. The Terrans are grotesquely ugly both in appearance and character like I mentioned earlier, but it's the Abh who will creep you out big-time when they finally reveal their true colours - only to get passed off as noble heroes by the show. Even creepier is the hornet symbolism of their emblems, which captures their shockingly blind hive-mentality, as well as their impulsive vengefulness and ferocity, rather too uncannily. 
So there you have it - Crest of the Stars started out as a grandly ambitious and extremely promising Space Opera show that seemed to challenge even Legend of the Galactic Heroes in its scope and emotional impact. Instead, it turned out to be something so nasty it beggars belief, and leaves you feeling sickened and horrified. The world of this show is a quietly creepy theatre of cruelty, populated by ugly and horrible people on both sides, where fairness and decency never stood a chance because the stakes were rigged all along. If, like me, you feel nostalgic for 90's-era animation, or have a soft corner for shows with a tranquil and reflective atmosphere (and this show has it in spades), this show may seem like the best thing the anime medium has had to offer - at least initially. But in the end, you're left feeling thoroughly cheated at an entertainment level - and not to mention utterly appalled at the horror you had to witness.

    Crest of the Stars is an odd anime. It's a grand scale Space Opera like Galactic Heroes, but it's very unique at the same time. It's famous, and in some circles infamous, for being the most elitist anime EVER made. Having watched Banner of the Stars and about 900 other anime, I can confirm this is likely true. 
The word ""elitism"" gets tossed around MAL a lot. Anyone who thinks Evangelion and Texhnolyze are better than Angel Beats and Bleach gets called an ""elitist"" and soon self identifies that way. What actually is elitism? 
Definition: Elitism is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an elite—a select group of people with a certain ancestry, intrinsic quality, high intellect, wealth, special skills, or experience—are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. 
The vast majority of shows and directors who are called ""elitist"" don't fit the bill. Hideaki Anno is an otaku who loves Cutey Honey, suffers from depression, and takes an interest in human psychology. He isn't an elitist and his shows aren't elitist. Mamoru Oshii is a socialist, so that immediately rules him out. Masaki Yuasa is playful and eccentric, but hardly an elitist. If Galactic Heroes were truly an elitist series, Yang would be the villain and Rudolph von Goldenbaum would be portrayed as the hero. This of course is not the case. 
So how does Banner of the Stars win this title? Banner is pro-colonialist, political diatribe set in space that tries to use Nietzsche's ""On the Genealogy of Morals"" to prove that superior races should rule over inferior ones. Hoo boy! 
In the future, humans use genetic engineering to create a master race of elves. The elves are more intelligent than humans, stronger, more beautiful, create better art, and create their own morality based on their superior Will to Power. The elves disdain democracy as a product of inferior peoples trying to drag down the strong, and the anime goes WAY out of its way to say the elves are 100% correct. While Galactic Heroes wishes to show the flaws and benefits of different government types, Banner of the Stars just wants to shove its message right down your throat. 
The Elves believe it would benefit the humans to be ruled over as slaves, which is a point our main human character agrees with! The only humans that oppose the elves are simply jealous and ""butthurt"" that the elves are so much better than them. The humans suffer from a ""Slave Morality"" which is based on weakness, resentfulness, and jealousy. The Elves judge good or evil by the result. They create their own values. The humans judge good and evil by intent and irrational emotions. The humans call the conquering elves ""evil"", merely because the elves being superior hurts their fee fees. The Slave Morality doesn't seek to create value, merely to drag down the superior to their level. In essence, anything the Masters stand for becomes ""evil"".  
While this series is certainly bold and shocking, I don't feel it adds anything of value to anime. It's a very simplistic, teenage surface reading of Nietzsche to push a frankly disgusting political agenda. The characters are as interesting as cardboard cut outs, and the animation is just meh. The production values are the only reason I didn't give this a 1. I'm a very fair critic. 
Banner of the Stars is basically what would happen if Legend of the Galactic Heroes was written by William Luther Pierce...and then was boring as fuck on top of it. At least the script writer went on to write Witch Hunter Robin...which is just boring. At least Robin wasn't stomach churning, cringey, AND boring. The director hasn't worked on much else, but at least he went on to direct Shin Cutie Honey, the 90s reboot with the massive tits.  
If you're interested in subversive art, I guess you could give this a try. On a technical scale it isn't that bad, because Sunrise agreed to make it for some unknown reason. How the hell do I end a review of the farthest right anime ever made? Well...I guess I could bring out the dead memes. (Disgusted Chinese Man) Banner of the Stars...It's just so tiresome!""

    *This review contains spoilers 
A rating of 1/10 is way too low to be left unjustifed and that is why I wrote this review. 
One of the oldest tricks in the trade is to create an overly intricate setting to try and mask the bias and deceit in an artwork. In my opinion, Seikai no Monshou does this and worse. I will try to explain why I came to this conclusion and I hope to do so in a way that will not seem offensive to anyone. 
Story: 1/10 
""Crest of the Stars"" takes place in an imaginary future where a race, formerly engineered by humans, has created a feudal empire which has become the greatest force in the galaxy. Opposing this empire are different human groups whose leaders are elected democratically. The Abhs are the genetically modified humans who rule the afore mentionned empire and the show focuses on a young human called Ghintec as he is escorted by the Abh princess Lamhirh. The story basically revolves around this duo and the evolution of their relationship as they are caught in a galactic war between the Empire and an alliance of democratic groups. I believe I can say this much without spoiling the show.  
Throughout the 13 episodes, we see the Abhs portrayed as galant, prideful and beautiful beings (well people seem to think they are in the show) who are both impulsive and martial but also reasonable and compassionate (yes, it seems the author doesn't realise that the former are the opposite of the latter). We learn about their reproductive habits : basically they can reproduce with just about anything in any way imaginable. We also learn about their strength and their longevity: they are very long-lived and almost eternally young - yes, pretty creepy when your progenitor - can't really say parent - looks as young as you. Finally, we are told of their social structure which, on a private level, is just about non-existent and on a national level is exactly that of any monarchy of our past. We also learn that their violent campaign of colonization of the galaxy is justifed by saying that it is for the good of humankind and that it is carried out with the intention of bringing peace and development. That will sound familiar to any history students as basically all former colonial empires have justified the horror of their actions in that same way. The only (willingly) negative portrait of an Abh, is that of a noble from a recently created barony who basically loathes humans because his father was one and suffers from an inferiority complex. It really seems as if the author showed him to convince us that he wasn't completely partial but it's the exact opposite that transpires. He doesn't criticize in any way the Abhs or their society but only tries to convince us that only pure Abhs can make it work and that lowly humans can tag along as long they admiringly obey every command. 
The democratic alliance on the other hand is portrayed as a rag-tag team of envious and imperfect (meaning normal humans) beings who stage an attack to create a conflict. All members of this alliance are shown as rather ugly people both of mind and body (one of the ambassadors actually has a scar and eyepatch...). Their reasons for going to war against the colonial empire ruled by another species are shown to be greed, cowardice and envy. Their words are shown as being those of hypocrites and all their speeches and annoucements sound like propaganda. The author tries to convince us that only despicable beings can fight against a colonial empire that plans to rule by destroying all existing social structures and imposing its culture and values and denying the human race its basic right to have a voice in the organisation of society. 
Throughout the show, humans of the democratic alliance are portrayed in a very unflattering manner and the main protagonists are put into situations that further imply the ""greatness"" of the Abhs and the inferiority of the humans. The pure Abhs are never made to look bad and all their strange behaviors are passed off as the delightful quirks of rightful lords and ladies. The author went so far as to create a new language for this race in what seems like an obvious attempt to make this show seem awe-inspiring in its form so people would accept the content more easily. Indeed, a person is likely to be astonished by the effort taken to create such a detailed fictional world and not realise that it was done to push through some very twisted ideas and concepts. 
 It seems obvious to me that the author is a nostalgic of imperialism and this imaginary galaxy and its imaginary genetically superior race was his way of trying to make something so fundamentaly wrong as a feudal and colonial system seem to work just fine. Unlike in shows like ""Legend of the Galactic Heroes"", there is no debate here, only a mockery of one. Had the Abhs really existed, this anime would have made great propaganda for them. Furthermore, the fact that the Abhs are a GENETICALLY superior race of rulers reminds one of rather unpleasant memories of the past... 
The work on these was rather pitiful in my opinion but still very much in accord with the purpose of the show. All Abhs (except for a black sheep) are grand beings and all humans are either dying of envy and hatred or are in unabashed admiration before the greatness of the Abhs... Ghintec would be one of the admiring ones. Lamhirh is a typical member of the ruling class of a colonial empire, sure of the righteousness of her purpose and unquestioning of the principles that govern her life. 
Art: 5/10 
I cannot comment on the animation as I have too little knowledge to do so. I very much disliked the art of the show. The exaggerated ugliness of the ""inferior"" humans was pretty annoying. The Abhs looked pretty freakish to me but I think it quite possible that perveted humans might create such beings to serve them. 
Can't really says much about it except it didn't strike me in any way. I don't have much knowledge of music and the show was so annoying to me, no music could have salvaged it. 
Enjoyment: 1/10 
I have rarely ever been so annoyed by a show as this one. All that it tried to convey was in complete opposition to the values and principles I care for and defend.  
Overall: 1/10 
One of the things I appreciate most in any work of art, even if the opinions conveyed are not ones I share, is honesty. To me ""Seikai no Monshou"" is a very dishonest work. 
I believe that if you like intricately designed imaginary worlds then you might like this show. I also believe that if you value human freedom and the right to democratically elect your representatives and leaders, if you hate propaganda and dishonesty, if you hate being taken for a fool or when someone tries to fool you then you probably should not watch this anime.

    Overview: Crest of the Stars is by far one of my all time favorite anime.  That said it is not for everyone.  The show is set far into the future were humans have colonized the entire galaxy.  The two main characters Jinto and Lafiel are well developed and entertaining to watch.  If there is a down side to this show it is that it is rather slow paced, and involves a great deal of dialog.  Although there are action scenes in the show, this is not for people with short attention spans. 
Story: There are two stories taking place in crest of the stars, both of which are connected and continue into the squeals.  The first story is that of Jinto and Lafiel, without giving to much away, suffice to say that a good deal of the show focuses on there journey as they are tossed around by the events around them.  The second story is that of galactic politics.  Both stories are well told, and they intertwine throughout the show. 
Art: Although it is a bit dated by todays standards the visuals are still as stunning as when i first saw the show several years ago.  This is a prime example of aged excellence. 
Sound: Crest of the stars simply would not be as good a show if not for the amazing orchestra in the background.  The opening theme song does get old after a while, but the music during the show is some of the best iv herd in an anime.  This is not to say the music in and of itself is superb, but rather the fusion of art, sound and context of what is happening on screen at the moment is masterfully executed. (But the music is the strongest part hear because it invokes powerful emotion in various parts). 
Charecters: All of the characters in crest of the stars are well portrayed and developed.  The show even hints at cast members back ground just to give you more feel for the world.  Also Jino and Lafiel are two of my favorite characters out of any anime. 
Enjoyment:  The reason why enjoyment is lower than the other areas is simply because crest of the stars is a slow anime.  It can in certain places drag on a bit, when a more modern adaptation would be paced a bit quicker.  Despite this all of the other elements that make up the show more than compensate for it.  (once again though if you have a short attention span you will probably get board before any of the really intersecting things happen).

    While it was by far not magnificent in terms of its appearance or in terms of a number of those other elements that we greatly take for advantage from the more recent anime with improved graphics and sound, this older &quot;space drama&quot; drew me in from the first episode, beguiling me with its interesting story and interesting cinematography and storytelling. It's hard-pressed to find an anime like Seikai no Monshou, with its same blend of both serious and entertaining drama and dialogue, and its very intense space battle action scenes. 
Seikai no Monshou has a story that was both pure in its innocence and compelling in its complexity, featuring a not-so-simple delving into the politics of humankind and interstellar relations, as well as the genetically-enhanced race of the Abh, something just as interesting in its own right. Following closely, none of the episodes (as few as there were with only 13) failed to entertain me and none of them seemed off-key at all, blending into a story that was wrapped up without fail with the final episode, transitioning gently and with ease into the next &quot;season&quot; or series of the saga. 
Like I said earlier, however, the art was lacking, but even then I was surprised by how much it fit and how little I was distracted by it. It's not something that I would entirely dock many points off for. Too, the cinematography and interesting angles used to portray the story would also help buoy this particular area up. The sound too was fairly &quot;old&quot;, but still managed to fit with the show quite well; the voices, on the other hand, were done magnificently (in the subbed version, definitely not the dubbed).  
The characters in this show, while not completely original, did progress and were developed well, the main two characters and their relationship even more entertaining to watch and feel how well they manage to grow into each other and balance each other out so nicely. They definitely did not feel flat, which I always hate. 
Overall, this show is one I recommend to anyone who'd like to watch an intellectual sci-fi space show (with no mechas) that brings together politics and drama well enough to both entertain your adrenalin and give some practice for your brain. A great show that I really enjoyed!

    Watching Genshiken naturally incites an interest in the Anime-in-anime the guys from the club are all about; Kujibiki Unbalance, or as it is referred to most of the time; Kujiun. 
And much more interesting that its story in itself naturally is what this show says about anime during the time of Genshiken's creation.  
There always was generic Anime, no matter how you look at it, as well as people celebrating it who should know better. 
And now that that's out of the way, what makes this OVA special? 
It hits all the natural stages of 2000s generic highschool anime; A cast of wacky, but pretty one-note characters - complete with big, candy-colored hair and matching, big eyes, gimmicky accessories, big hands and feet and more thick, slightly disproportionate bodies making them look younger than they are, as was typical for contemporaries like Negima, Uuchuu no Stellvia or Key-Adaptations, inviting for a lot of doujinshi. 
The story beats are very structurally telling as well; The first episode introduces our colorful cast, very reminiscent of the classical structure of visuals novels of the time; 
A character/ love interest whom he mysteriously shares a past with acting distant now, possibly terminally ill, a club he is more or less forced to join comprised of nothing but the cutest girls of his entire year. A central theme very woven into narrative and even dialogue of the characters, so much so that it becomes really annoying really fast. 
You can pretty much write the rest of it in your head; We'll get character-centric episodes as well as romantic moments with our oblivious, innocent main character for each of these girls - even though we all know who he'll ultimately end up with - as well as small, dramatic moments and a lot of samey humor and obvious messages. 
(Although I personally never got tired of blue forehead girls' antics and don't think I would've ever gotten there, even with 1011 episodes of this, she's the best) 
Introducing aliens into the mix as well as putting a lot of stakes into random competitions add to the wackyness and keep things as fresh as the stale character archetypes will allow it to be. 
Episode 21 shows some of these ridiculous competitions, as well as hinting at what will result in the club briefly falling apart in episode 25, only to reunite by the end and getting right into the tearjerking finale, though not resolving everything and leaving some threads hanging since the Manga is still ongoing. 
Lottery forever indeed. 
And, honestly, the more I think about it, it's the kind of show everyone would've watched back at the time. 
The OVA doesn't exactly have anything to comment on what it presents; it's just what was popular and common at the time, re-packaged into an amalgamation of as much of it as possible. It's a must-watch for every fan of Genshiken, as well as anyone who can appreciate this aesthetic and these storybeats, but it doesn't really stand on its own outside of those demographics. 
But as someone both enjoying Genshiken and always interested in Anime trends of a time I personally wasn't around to experience, I thoroughly enjoyed this OVA and recommend it to anyone matching my description - although probably not more than once.

    These are 3 episodes of Kujibiki Unbalance which were the 1st, 21st and 25th episodes. This is the fictitious anime that the Genshiken guys were always watching, and after watching these 3 episodes, I think I liked it as much as the Genshiken guys did. These OVAs are definitely a MUST WATCH for people who liked Genshiken. 
The 3 episodes I watched were just like previews of the show so I'm not so sure about the story. As from what I've understood in these 3 episodes, the story is about a boy named Chihiro that got into Rikkyouin High School, his encounters with people there, a reunion with his childhood friend he promised to marry, and the Kujibiki, a school tournament, festival or tradition thing in which all the students face all kinds of battles for a whole year, be it sports, cooking, and silly competitions like enduring extreme temperature (synopsis says it's a battle for student government positions). It's a pretty fun and interesting story. 
The art is really good. Everything looks great and the original character designs are nice. Problem is, only the designs were nice, most of the drawings seen are unattractively non-proportional and makes the characters look bad. Still, the animation is great, the characters move well and the action scenes are impressive. 
The sounds are great. All the characters' voices are perfect. The soundtracks are nice and well fitted, and so are the effects. It has an attractive OP song and the ED song is good as is. 
All the characters are great and likable. They have all kinds of fun personalities which makes the show comedy-funny and action-cool at the same time. 
People would enjoy Kujibiki Unbalance as much as the Genshiken characters did. It's an anime of almost everything just like Seto no Hanayome. These 3 episodes are so good that viewers would want to check out the Kujibiki Unbalance 2006 alternate.

    There is no finer embodiment to the shattering melancholy and bracing affirmation of hopelessness than the 22 episodes that make up Texhnolyze.  
I want to admit that this anime has overwhelmed me immensely for years. My efforts at writing a review before didn't ensue because if written, it would have been nothing but babble. I wonder if this will even be close to a lucid appraisal.. 
How do I classify Texhnolyze? This is the sort of anime that people will either think is brilliant or terrible.  
It is brutal, confusing and minimal. It has a lot of violent imagery and cruel messages, a complex storyline and slow but methodical pacing, a minimalistic dialogue and visual and thematic symbolism. 
The events take place in a metropolis buried deep inside the earth. A place that reigns with severed limbs and lost souls, Lux is hard to escape, and to stay there is to stay at the very mouth of hell, this underground city of utter damnation felt to me like a character in itself, its landscapes forge a portrait that speaks only of loneliness and alienation. In random impressions It indifferently narrates its lifeless autobiography. 
I find myself bewildered with how I should speak of the characters. Sometimes they seemed to me like abstract concepts, not much is explained about them and its hard to get emotionally attached to them. 
Ichise, Shinji, Onishi, Yoshii, Ran and the doctor, each of the characters had their own ways, their own ideologies. It was interesting to see how each one of them reacted to the conflicts and how they had to take a step back to reassess the path they've been following, how they faced themselves afterwards. 
Personally I found Ichise to be a fascinating character, A truly lost human being whose mind struggles in unsuccessful attempts to discover himself. Bit by bit he wrenches himself out of the swamp in which he had long languished.  
Art:  
Yoshitoshi Abe never disappoints.  
The art here is dark and murky. There is some kind of poeticism and sadness to the visuals that emphasize a sense of hopelessness throughout the series. 
*There are some scenes in a specific episode that seems to be inspired by Edward Hopper’s paintings, something which I found absolutely enchanting.  
Here is a link that shows both the paintings and the anime scenes: 
https://halfadeckshort.wordpress.com/2012/01/28/hopper-vs-texhnolyze/ 
Most of the time, the anime relies on silence, which suits it's minimalistic nature.  
The OST varies between loud guitar solos and tender violin and piano pieces. *There is a specific piece that is hauntingly beautiful and sad ""A far away lightning"".  
The OP is a techno industrial track which fits the show perfectly. The ending song is very emotional and sad, it has nothing to do with the anime yet somehow has everything to do with it. 
Overall:  
This is a bold and experimental anime that strongly explores nihilistic and ontological themes such as - but not limited to - the search for and annihilation of meaning , texhnolyzation as the last hope for humanity, ditching the body entirely and replacing it with something else for the sake of pursuing a higher state of being.  
Texhnolyze is unique in its story, in its characters, in the way it combines silence and mystery with striking atmospheric sensory images to build a montage of profundity and intensity. 
A daring and maybe a little scary conception of humanity's future and fate. Brilliantly incorporating political events to help illustrate an abominable image of a world, where a man is only a stranger desperately trying to perceive a reason to continue with the numbing meaninglessness of existence.  
This show is not easy or comfortable to watch, it is very cold and humorless, has no fan service and no kawaii android girls, it has possibly the most miserable ending ever made in anime. So check your expectations at the door.  Recommended only for those who don't mind their perception of existence to be challenged and possibly torn down.

    [No spoilers. This review is for people who are considering whether to view this title.] 
Story/Setting/Style: 
- Do not watch if you dislike slower, cerebral anime (e.g., Ergo Proxy, Serial Experiments Lain, Casshern Sins). Texhnolyze moves slowly, but by the time you finish the series, you'll realize that a lot has happened. The writing is plot-driven, rather than character-driven. 
- Do not watch if you have a strong preference for sappy, feel-good stories. 
- Do not watch if you do not want to think. The dialogue can be sparse, and nothing is spelled out for the viewer. 
- If you like sci-fi, this anime does a marvelous job depicting a foreign, futuristic, but dilapidated world (in the same vein as cyberpunk or tech noir) and, more importantly, making you feel immersed in it. 
- This is not a character-driven story, so do not expect the round, dynamic characters who helped make Cowboy Bebop, Steins;Gate, and Fullmetal Alchemist the masterpieces they are. This is not a negative. Rather, the lack of focus on any specific character is a good thing here. 
- Notwithstanding the above, the main characters in Texhnolyze are extremely well-done and are deceptively deep once you analyze their actions and motivations. They are sufficiently fleshed-out to be believable and move the story along without receiving too much focus. The characters are pieces, and they fit perfectly. 
Art & Sound: 
- I'm generally not too particular about these aspects of anime titles. So long as the writing and direction are good, and the art and sound aren't distractingly bad, I'll enjoy the series.  
- That said, the depictions of the various settings were excellent. Technically, the art and sound were sufficiently good. 
- Firstly, it is noteworthy that this anime has a lot of ""10"" reviews despite having a relatively low average rating. This should indicate to you that (1) for the right audience, this series is a 10/10 masterpiece, and (2) this series is specifically tailored to a narrow audience. 
- If you made it past the first paragraph of this review, you are most likely within the target audience and should therefore watch this series. It really is a masterpiece. 
10/10

    This is an incredibly skillful anime.   
It is also depressing as all get-out. 
Any anime that really wants to depress its viewers has to have some amount of skill, or else it will lose its audience.  &quot;Now and Then, Here and There&quot; is my typical example of a depressing anime done with minimal necessary skill. 
&quot;Texhnolyze,&quot; on the other hand, is the work of a mad genius who went off his medication during production.  Oddly enough, the creator started working on this series while doing a much less depressing series, namely &quot;Charcoal Feather Federation.&quot;  Rumor has it he needed to do a depressing series to balance out the uplifting emotions from &quot;Charcoal Feather Federation.&quot; 
So, yeah, the creative talent behind this show is literally insane.  Therefore I recommend watching it with a certain amount of self-restraint.  If you like the ultimate direction of the storyline, I recommend &quot;Gilgamesh,&quot; a similarly epic story that I enjoyed much more.  Both stories tend to tell a lot with just visual images, silences, and implications rather than lots of verbal exposition.

    I really don't know how to feel about this anime. I'd read so much comments about it with the labels ""underrated"" and ""masterpiece"", so I felt the obligation to watch it... and, oh boy, this must be one of the less enjoyable shows I ever witnessed. I will not make a large review, so i'm going straight to the point. 
The most remarkable things about Texhnolyze (there are not too much) is the well done, immersive and creepy atmosphere created in the city of Lux, the underground decadent city where the story unfolds. The animation also was very good and there was no abuse of using CGI. 
The premise of the story was very interesting, but... 
- The pacing was terrible. Unpleasant. A torture. Sincerely, watching our protagonist Ichise for about 7 episodes growling, walking to nowhere punching whatever comes to his way was too much for a show of 22 episodes. 
- It was frustrating that almost the entire anime I had no idea of what the fuck is going on. How the hell this is tagged as psychological if we have no idea what are the character's feelings, fears, motivations, goals and a long etc. All we see is just inexpressive faces with dialogs of their own business. 
- The characters have been the less empathetic that I ever seen. The indifference of Ichise, the alpha male attitude of Oonishi and Shinji overwhelmed me, and Ran... what we knew about her? She was a prophet. Nothing more. 
I don't know how i make it to go throughout all the 22 episodes. Although the world of Texhnolyze was more than interesting, the story was very poorly developed and it seems they tried to fix it in the last chapters with extreme and very graphic violence, and putting on the table deep topics like the future of mankind. 
I don't like to compare anime, but I will make an exception. In Serial Experiments Lain (who shares the same cyberpunk style) it also have slow pace and dark atmosphere, but every episode keeps you interested. while Texhnolyze fails miserably. In simple words: It's boring. That's it. 
If you are into cyberpunk, give it a try... but i'm pretty sure there are better choices to watch out there. 
Story................. 3/10, Poorly narrated, bad pacing 
Art.................... 8/10, Well done dark atmosphere 
Sound............... 8/10, Outstaning Op&Ed Theme's! 
Character..........2/10, nothing much to say here... 
Enjoymentent....2/10, It takes an excessive effort to finish it 
Overall...............4,6/10 ~ 5/10 
English is not my native language, so for every gramatical error: sumimasen! :)

    Texhnolyze is a hard anime to watch. The first episode sweeps you up into a world where everything starts out dark and seemingly mundane, and continues to be this way throughout the 22 episodes you watch. Everyone seems to be so tired and dead inside, like the city of Lux itself. With a minimalist style, not much is said, but does there really need to be words to describe what this show represents? 
Texhnolyze is an anime without excessive fight scenes, drama, or mostly anything that regularly pops up in current anime. Instead, it drags you along with Ichise slowly, almost painfully, having you experience and find out what being human really means, or rather what human society could turn into when evolving is no longer an option. The characters in Texhnolyze also strive to show the viewer human nature, most of them being more like symbols for certain characteristics of humanity than actual people. Texhnolyze is a slow show, however, if you stick it out and watch till the end, there is nothing quite like the conclusion Texhnolyze finds. 
Texhnolyze is not an anime for the characters. Instead, it uses the characters as a means to progress the story. This is why the characters can feel very far away, even when they've been in the show from start to finish. But that doesn't mean the characters themselves aren't well written. In fact, in my opinion, Texhnolyze uses it's characters so well that they seem human even when put to a distance. 
The soundtrack is particularly beautiful. Although the anime sometimes chooses silence over sound, whenever the music starts up, it never ceases to impress me, with mixtures of piano and violin, or even an electric guitar solo. 
Overall, Texhnolyze is not a pleasant watch. You can't watch this show and walk away happy and fulfilled. It instead tries to deliver a dark truth about humanity and what will happen when we are no longer able to evolve. It may not be fun or uplifting to watch, but it is certainly rewarding in the end. I personally loved every moment.

    Well that was something. 
Texhnolyze immersed me instantly with its cool ""show, not tell"" atmosphere/vibe. Sure not much character development happened in the early episodes but I was fine with that because it was only the first act, so I enjoyed it for what it was.  
Despite saying I liked ""show don't tell,"" as the series progressed and the stakes were raised I wish they told us just a little more, like why some characters behaved certain ways. 
I feel like I'm missing a few plot points... I think it's great that this show doesn't fully explain everything, but I need just a little more to be able to piece stuff together.  
I do like parts of it and ideas they were going for, but the show didn't make enough sense and felt like a weird fever dream that gets worse further into the night. Though I guess that also ties into why I partially liked it. 
I both liked Texhnolyze and I didn't and it's a very difficult show to rate. At least it showed a side of humanity we don't always see, that's why I like sci-fi. So, it's refreshing in that regard and there is just something about it that I do like. Maybe I'll grow to like it more the longer it resides in my brain. It's definitely a show that leaves an impression, which is a good quality in itself. Unlike many other shows that I score ""low"", I could see myself rewatching this and maybe even introducing it to someone else just to see what they think. It's not perfect but at least it's different. 
Update (08/17): Texhnolyze is an anime that stays with you. It's a heavy story that brings about emotion when I think back to it. I'm still not sure how much I ""like"" it, but I think I've grown to appreciate it more over time. It's an interesting exhibition of mankind that you will rarely see elsewhere.

    Evolution. Stagnation. The slow decay of the human race. Unravelling, the future collapses beneath our feet. Nothing can be done. Or can it? This is the essence of Texhnolyze. Providing meaning to an empty existence. And that is what we shall be discussing the simple yet powerful philosophy of one of the most impressive anime I have seen. Let’s dive in. 
Texhnolyze is both a nihilistic, brooding godawful drudgery that makes you feel abysmal while watching it and a provocative tale of understanding the meaning of life. These two seemingly contrasting ideas are on full display throughout the show. The absence of dialogue, sound and any sort of idea as to what is going on makes the first few episodes of the series almost unbearable to sit through. The grunting, the bland colors and decrepit infrastructure force the viewer to endure a tremendous amount of empty time. To some this will certainly throw you off and have you cursing the show for its slow nature. However, to fight through the torturous opening you will begin to see that it was created with the intention of being boring and heavy in order to model the brooding empty nihilistic perception of life. No show I have seen so perfectly captures the meaninglessness of life as Texhnolyze’s opening episodes do.  
Despite its start Texhnolyze is not about sulking and retiring as the emptiness overtakes one’s life, rather it is all about doing anything to fight it. Ichise is symbolic of a person who lives only for the sake of living, the evolutionary animal that knows it must not die no matter what even if it possesses no reason to live. This survival instinct is what keeps Ichise moving and nothing beyond that. He has no real reason to live and has no fabricated meaning to his life. He simply chooses to live because that is what life is biologically programmed to do. I find this aspect of his character fascinating as no matter how much easier it would be for him to give up and die he never does but without reason or motive. Is it ignorance or courage, in my opinion neither it just is an instinct, raw unbiased instinct, although living without reason to humans is akin to stupidity (just look at how we treat animals whom only live to live). 
In contrast to Ichise’s survival only mode, through Yoshii do we see someone who lives for a reason. Yoshii is the catalyst that begins the war in Lux through his mischief and by openly acting out against the end of times. He knows that life is meaningless and inevitably everyone will die. However, as he used to live on the surface he does not wish to give in to the inevitable like everyone else. Yoshii desires something, anything that provides him with a meaning to life. Thus, he goes to Lux in order to scream and cry into the void that he was here and that there was a meaning, even if fabricated by himself, to his life. By stirring up the factions of Lux, Yoshii is able to not only make his life vastly more meaningful he is also giving the people of Lux a reason to live, if they wish not to die or lose control then at least they will have a meaning to their life and will not become like the people on the surface.  Yoshii does not care that people will die because they would have inevitably died anyways and it is better for them to go with a passion rather than the emptiness of the surface people. Yoshii’s ideology is extremely interesting and it is one that I have adapted into my own life. Although I used to scorn the hedonistic aspects of life and believed that a person should discipline themselves sometimes I am drawn back to this idea of living as you wish because there is no point so you might as well do what you want. Yoshii exemplifies this idea and although it conflicts with my own at times I can’t help but envy the ecstasy of living without restraint.  
Now this answer to nihilism is not the only fascinating ideology provided in Texhnolyze but the idea of transhumanism is constantly brought into the fray. However, unlike most works that deal with transhumanism and the evolution of the human race Texhnolyze takes a different perspective and ostenstibly more nihistic than moost ofther sci-fi. Texhonlyzation (cyberization) is a popular procedure for high ranking Organo members and other people. It is a means to improve one’s awareness, strength, and agility but aside from the violent aspects it is also a way to prevent people’s bodies from dying. The implications of Texhnolyzation could be vast however Texhnolyze handles it in an ironic manner, rather than these changes having major positive effect on the lives of people they almost make living worse.  The excessive Texhnolyzed Shapes Kano invades Lux with are sickening and barely human, although super soldiers they are a far cry from an ideal evolution of the human race. Most other texhnolyzed people don’t fare much better aside from being saved from swords on a few occasions, having metal limbs doesn’t make them anything more than that, no fullmetal alchemists here. This is a biting critique of the transhumanist belief of many science fiction shows that see cyberization as a means of evolving humanity. Personally, I wish more time was dedicated to Texhnolyzation in the show so we could understand better the implications it has on the world and maybe seen more interesting developments in it for we did not really get much explanation on it. Though I guess that is texhnolyze’s nature. In the end, Texhnolyzation is a powerful criticism of transhumanism and the idea that humanity can evolve beyond our current level through cyberization and other biological enhancement of the body. As Kano unleashes the shapes to destroy humanity while the intentions of texhnolyze that doc had in mind were to save humanity, irony akin to Vonnegut’s “Cat’s Cradle.” 
Another major aspect of Texhnolyze is the idea of having personal agency in a world devoid of meaning. I already talked extensively about the philosophical motivations (or lack thereof) that some characters possessed. Now I would like to discuss the importance of agency in the show, in my opinion yet another fascinating element of the story. Living in a world where you have no control over your own mind, actions or body is horrifying. If you are alive then at the very least to live comfortably one must have what is their own under their own power. This however, is not possible in rigid societies whom restrict many personal freedoms and warp our identities. Ichise is constantly fighting to gain control over his life. We are introduced to him as a prize fighter who is brutally attacked and nearly dies only to be spared by a doctor in order to be used as her test subject. Then in an act of pity is granted a membership in the Organo in order to do the handy work for Oonishi.  He follows Ran around who sees his future and knows what will happen to him and that there is little he can do to change it. Nothing that Ichise has is his own, not even his arm and leg. Thus he continually struggles to gain control over his mind and body. I’d love to tell you how he manages but I think I’ll leave that up to you. Ran also struggles deeply with having agency over her life. As the Prophet of Gabe, Ran is supposed to be their seer and tell them what they must do based on the futures she sees. However, Ran despises her ability and wishes to be rid of it. She does not want to accept her role and refuses to act upon the visions that she sees. Ran is attached to her label of seer and wishes to be rid of the responsibility and torture that comes from knowing the future of the end of humanity. Ichise and Ran, among all the other characters, find that they no longer are in control of their own lives and although Yoshii attempts to quell this fear, in the end their lives and deaths remain out of their jurisdiction. 
Those are the three major areas I saw Texhnolyze handling; the philosophy to overcome nihilism, the irony of the transhumanists, and the collapse of agency leading to the end of civilization. This is all I have to say 4 months after seeing the show, I only read briefly up on the names of some things however the philosophies and themes developed in the show stayed fresh in my memory. Given a rewatch I believe I can add extensive detail to these three themes as I know for certain I could talk about Oonishi more along with adding better descriptions and examples for what I do talk about. Thus I do hope you can understand that this is not a finished product and I will return to update this blog after I rewatch Texhnolyze whenever that may be. This is less of a review and more of a thematic analysis since I believe this is a better way of communicating my thoughts. But since I am posting this on my MAL now (already been posted on my AA account) I should say that the animation is good though the character art is not that impressive, the music is great although used minimally and overall it is a show I enjoyed.

    I don't think ""Texhnolyze"" really counts as an anime; I prefer to think of it as an incredible idea that happens to be animated. I admit this is because I don't want all of my favorites anime to be replaced because it's just that good. I need to mention right up front that this is a highly dark anime that will make any watcher depressed or frustrated, and by the end you WILL be in tears no matter who you are. It's painfully slow and nearly every episode is full of faded,drab colors and endless conversation; but, if you're the type who can stand to listen closely, your patience will be richly rewarded. There is absolutely no waste in the show. Every word, color, emotion, and especially sound has an important part in getting the show's message across. This results in a highly dense anime that you will probably have to see at least twice just to understand everything that happens in the complex world.  
The art is just my personal taste (more rounded and soft) with excellent movement and color that supports the story. The sound is incredible. It is so believable that I felt a sense of nostalgia by the end of the first episode and felt comfortable in the story's world by the third episode. The sound alone pulls the watcher into a total submersion because everything you hear coincides perfectly with what you'd expect to hear in a specific scene down to the annoying grate of a slow moving ceiling fan.This submersion means that the watcher will be subject to horrifyingly real screams as well as ambient mundane sounds, but it's there for a reason: the watcher feels like he knows the world almost as if he or she had lived there at some point.  
The characters are vast, complex, and, best of all, adaptable. The viewer sees every character reacting to the events of the story in their own unique ways changing the way humans really do. I believe that any person could find a character they can empathize with. Personally, I found bits of myself in nearly all of the characters and felt an extremely strong connection with several of them. 
I gave enjoyment a 7/10 because this is an anime that cannot truly be enjoyed. I would rather say that I am in awe of it. It's brutal to watch and definitely depressing, and by the end you will either have felt a piece of you die, found redemption, or be crushed by both. It a good pain though the kind that makes you appreciate life.  
Before I forget, I must warn potential watchers the first episode is purely to introduce you to the world and begin the immersion process. As such, it is a total trip that is very difficult to get through. PLEASE DON'T SKIP IT! In fact, I suggest watching it at least twice before moving on because it's more informative and dense that any other episode. The rest of the episodes follow what you expect in anime as far as speech to action ratio.  
For my own peace of mind, I give it its own pedestal at 11/10. Be wary though it is not for every one. People tend to love it to death or hate it with a passion.

    .Existentialism Hardcore. 
     Texhnolyze is a very divisive show, that's very hard to recommend due to one particular flaw despite being great. First of all, Texhnolyze should be commended because amongst all the crapfest that surrounds much of anime nowadays, here's one of the few shows that commits itself with a precise focus in its presentation and visual storytelling and does not hold back to explain itself. It fully expects its audience to dig deep to get the full scope of what the show is trying to convey. Here's a show that gives a good example of showing, not telling, while  also developing a fantastic story, especially in the second half of the show. 
However, this ambitious classic is not without its troublesome flaws. You see, Texhnolyze, while having a great plot overall, feels a little disjointed or unfocused at times. I am not talking about the story which is difficult to follow due to its nature, that is a given going into the show, but more in the sense that its slow first half doesn't do enough in terms of plot and pacing to give way to the much more frantic and much more brilliant second half. It's feels as though the second half of the story wasn't laid out and planned when the studio started making Texhnolyze, it feels somewhat disconnected. When the story and pace of Texhnolyze ramps up, the transition feels jarring to say the least. But at the same time, that second half brings much needed excitement and gave a much needed jolt to its story and characters. 
     Let's start this with the first half which builds up an incredible top-notch atmosphere, up there with the very best, and has absolutely MINIMAL dialogue, exercising visual storytelling in a compelling manner. The introductory episodes are very intriguing. You become engrossed by the city of Lux and its FANTASTIC bleak, gloomy atmosphere. But then you find something else as the show goes on, you start  noticing that the show is moving very slowly, I mean REALLY slowly. This is perhaps the biggest downside to Texhnolyze. The pacing. This is by far the slowest pacing I've experienced in a TV show bar the Castle invasion in HxH. It moves at a snail's pace, and it wouldn't have been a problem had it been like that for 5/6 episodes tops, but it stays that way for far too long, more than a dozen episodes, highly detracting from the overall enjoyment of the show. Don't get me wrong, I love that it tells part of its story through visuals, and not cramming exposition down your throat, it's a welcome change from everything else. But the problem is that the snail's pacing dulled the intrigue I had in this part of the story. 
     Another issue I have with the show is its characters, I know it's completely intentional and goes hand-in-hand with the setting/tone and themes of the show, but the characters are WAY too monotonous/dull for the audience to be invested in them, especially the two main leads, Ichise and Ran. Thinking about the characters overall leave me with mixed feelings, I believe that most of the characters are not developed as well as they could've been throughout the story, except for Eriko and Oonishi to an extent. It would've been great to see Yoshii get some development as well, but that would've required a change in story for the first half, but I think it would've made for a really intriguing plot in the first part of the story, having him as the lead for a couple of episodes and learning about his character, instead of the audience learning his character motivations later on. Still, he is a good enigmatic character. 
I can't give the same praise to the main character, Ichise, as he stays mostly static in terms of personality throughout the whole story. We never know what's going on through his head, and he doesn't do much either, so he feels distant to the audience. It also doesn't help that he doesn't show any emotion or has a different look besides the flat/angry/uninterested face and we don't learn much about his backstory, so it's hard to be invested in a character when you're not given much reason to care besides his current predicament/misery. You're spectating him, but you're not getting invested in him. Admittedly, this was done on purpose, but it still doesn't make for a great watch. You can have a mostly silent main character and still have them be compelling, which is exactly what ABe succeeded at with the character of Lain in ""Serial Experiments Lain"", so I'm a bit boggled as to why I didn't get a feel for Ichise's character. I personally would've liked to see him develop more throughout the show, and/or watch a couple of episodes dedicated to what led him to his current situation. Ran is not as troublesome due to what her character is supposed to be and she's given much less screen time. 
     Texhnolyze is a show that's hard to cement my thoughts on. On one hand, I really love its themes and setting, its last few episodes are pure brilliance, especially the ending. Texhnolyze's ending is one that chills you to the very core, REALLY driving home the existentialism aspect of the show.  
I believe the show could've been a masterpiece had its issues been addressed. It could've been a smoother ride pacing-wise if a couple of episodes were cut in the first half. I know this was the vision of the director for this show, but I can't shake how I feel about it overall, amazed and conflicted. If I ever decide to re-watch it, perhaps I'll  feel better about the show overall. For now my rating hovers between a 7 and an 8. 
     Overall, Texhnolyze is definitely not for everyone, however, I'd consider this show a must watch if you like the topic of existentialism, and/or want to try something philosophically rich that will keep you pondering for a while, absolutely give this a try.  I do have some reservations, but this is still a very good anime. Due to its pacing and ambiguous nature of Texhnolyze's story, many people are driven away from this gem, but if you can endure its pacing and overcome its flaws you'll find that you have a story worth experiencing. 
[Final Score]: 7.5/10

    Since many of the members have elucidated really beautifully about Texhnolyze in their reviews, I thought I would drop down a series of short points on why this is a great anime which deserves more attention than it has acquired.  
• The trio of Yoshitoshi ABe, Yasuyuki Ueda and Chiaki J. Konaka combine yet again to deliver us, if not a masterpiece, a show which is just short of being a masterpiece. The show has incorporated some of the direst elements like hopelessness, dystopian society, psychological warfare, human conflicts, feral nature of the humans and crime groups very well. 
• The Opening theme, 'Guardian Angel' gave the anime that cyberpunk-ish feel whereas the ending theme. 'Tsuki no Uta' was more of a peaceful song; the very same peacefulness that was missing in Lux and which the citizens of that rundown city longed desperately for. The background score was crisp and suited the environment and the atmosphere of the anime real well. Utilization of different genres of music proved to be a success as almost all of the tracks were brilliant.  
• As always, Madhouse has done an absolutely brilliant and noteworthy job in animating this show. They paid attention to very minor details, the camera angles were exquisite in many scenes and the characters looked realistic and were up to the point without any sort of extravagance involved. The color palette and the hues used were post-apocalypse personified. Different contrasts of sepia, many gray elements and at times the darkness and shadows on the buildings exuded originality and precision. Once you lay your eyes on the first episode, you'll realize that you are in for one dark, malevolent ride filled with virulence. 
• This has become a cliche of sorts now but still, it has to be said that this is an anime which will provide the enjoyment for every audience out there. The very slow nature, the cruelty involved and the blatant hopelessness with which the humans are pitted against will most definitely be a turn off for many audiences. 
• What I loved the most about this anime is that it had very sparse dialogues for the starting handful of episodes. This allows the viewers to interpret the world and its horrendous living conditions, the state of each and every character and allows us to intake as much of the information as possible through visuals and the beautiful music alone. Also, the attention to detail was terrifyingly great. The tense and the increasing breathing, the subtle footsteps in an almost silent scene, the clink-clanks of the Texhnolyzed limbs are some of the many details that must be paid attention to.

    The story starts off in a very slow pace beginning with the first episode.  It starts out a little confusing in the first episode because there was no dialogue for a while so I couldn't understand what was going on.  The visual appeal of the art and animation is what got my attention and thats why I continued to watch it past the first episode.  The art and animation kind of ""told"" me what was happening.   
The story automatically reminded me of Battle Angel and Terminator.  This anime's story blends in the plot of both plus a helping of the Yakuza(mafia) element.  If you have watched and comprehend both Battle Angel and Terminator, the story would not be hard to understand because it shares similar premise.   
The first half of the series is pretty much a bloodbath.  In almost every episode there is a mob boss and his gang who got whacked.  I pretty much lost track of which mob boss got killed by which boss by mid series.  The second half of the series explains why the ""Class"" was turning the mafia against each other and Organo (the big prosthetic company) and why they are trying to use cybernetics to take over the world. 
The animation was pretty good, however, in the intense fights and amputations, alot of the sequences were repeated in multiple episodes.  I can't really blame the artist because animation is a long and expensive process so it is very difficult to make it complex. 
Overall, the bodily movements are smooth. 
The sound is adequate but what was odd is that the guns sound the same no matter the type of caliber.  If a gun nut watches this they might mark a minus on the score but I won't.   
However, the sync between the movement of the lips and dialogue doesn't always go smoothly.  Its a little awkward.   
The characters are an enigma and each are quite disturbing especially Doc and her brother (the head honcho of the ""Class"").   
Ichise, he is a mystery.  At first he is one psycho, who would knock out anybody who looks at him especially after he got his prosthetics.  He thinks of himself as freak of nature. Then he becomes quiet and loyal to his boss (Keigo Onishi) who adopts him into his group.   
He later befriends Ran, the mysterious girl who is also a prophet. 
Keigo Onishi is probably, the only sane character in the story.  He is like a rock.  He wants order and stability.  Violence is a last resort.  Negotiation is his choice of weapon.   
Overall, I enjoyed the anime but mostly because of the art and animation.   The story is average.  I have watched and read other medias with similar stories to draw conclusions before the end of the series.

    Texhnolyse , compared to the other anime from the mainstream  media has an unique style of aproachment .The anime doesn't adapt to the preferences of the whole audience but the viewer that must adapt .I was reading an interesting review that got in my sight that had a remark like : "" the story is kind of told from the perspective of the city itself "" How so ? Well , it's rare in anime for the story to be seen from the perspective of every character allowing the audience to come with an relatively   objective opinion towards the events , on a more profound theme , the watcher being also the city itself too .Texhnolyse doesn't explain from the first episodes the storyline , some of the facts being showed in time .if you are a fan of the anime with a rapid and dynamic action then you may not appreciate it's style .in fact , the story is slow and for some , this thing can be really boring but if you get to appreciate the dark tone of the anime that is accompanied by the animation and music , then Tehnolyze might be an unforgettable experience for you .I can't guarantee it will be likeable or dislikable , but it has  a distinctive tone that will help you recognise it from a 100 anime. From this point I will try to get into the details of the anime through a point of view as objective as i can . MINOR SPOILERS ALERT! 
-Characters :  
The MC is called IchiSe , a young man that has been through a lot of harsh events ( like every character in Tehnolyze, actually )  
He is presented as being quiet, impulsive , and emotionless .An orphan that after his parents death ,  he started spending his time with street fights . Because of someone's revenge , he loses his right arm and leg , and from this point on everything starts to get more complicated for him ;possessing a fantastically  will to live , proven in a lot of near death situations , he has a vanity that is equal to that , funding himself in a deathly situation , he refuses even the food given to him by the crossing civills. During the anime , the character is looking for a way out of his nihilistic life trying to find a sense to his existence .The character is a reflection to the city itself : cold , souless and senseless and going straight to an unavoidable death . MC is trying to find a purpose in all of those . The characters have their own value set up,  gathered together during their story , all of them being very distinct people . From Oneshi, that was trying to gather some order in a society full of chaos , to Yoshi that was trying to destroy it and Doc , that finds purpose only in technology , to some characters that believe life is senseless anyways ( like the main character , Toyama ). 
STORYLINE : the action is slow , and that might be boring for some ,but in my opinion , it creates a  dark and serious atmosphere around the anime . 
MUSIC:the soundtracks are impeccable , they fit perfectly with the dark atmosphere of the anime . The opening song is good , but what impressed me the most were the 2 ending songs that couldn't be more perfect , in my opinion . 
The relatively tragic end is accompanied by the music that is full of emotion , letting you at the end with an empty hole in your heart that is really hard to avoid . 
Animation : the animation is more than great , remembering the year that the anime came out .One thing that you will notice is that the animation is adaptable , going from a dark and cold tone to a lightful and warm one (this can be noticed from the episodes when the "" above "" people are shown ) 
Characters : 10/10 
Story : 9/10 
Animation :9/10 
Music: 10/10 
Enjoyment :10/10 
Overall : 10/10. 
In a more philosophical approach, the anime kind of fills the viewer with the idea of the nihilism and the realisation that a pupose does not exist on life full of emotion .After that , the end makes a 360 degrees return that makes you feel horrible for accepting the nihilism idea in the first place .the lack of emotion of the show compensating with the last episode .Truly a a masterpiece . 
Conclusion : Texhnolyze, obviously, is not an anime that can be appreciated by anyone , being something that a lot of people would call depressing and cruel , but if you got the determination to watch it until the end , I guarantee that the regret is not what you will find inside yourself.

    This is one of those animes that a person will dismiss after a couple of episodes or it will stick with them for a very long time. For me, its the latter. Since the synopsis of the series is already provided, I'll head straight for my thoughts on this masterpiece. 
Texhnolyze is not for everyone, I repeat Texhnolyze is NOT for everyone. It showcases dark subject matters such as incest, prostitution, and molestation. This is the first anime series I've seen that I would consider adult rated. Though several scenes made me cringe in discomfort, I was also in awe at how well executed those scenes were. It immersed me even more in the dark atmosphere of the series.  
Story: The story is original and provides a slow pace that gives the viewer an eerie vibe. It successfully leaves the viewer with an impending sense of doom and gloom. It's a very dark story that provides not a single bit of happiness. This is something that is made clear within the first couple episodes. So the series does not mislead you into thinking there is a happy ending because newsflash there is no happy ending for anyone who lives in the city of Lux. Another thing to point out is that much like Ergo Proxy, this series is extremely confusing. Confusing to the point where it might leave the viewer disoriented which I believe was a huge benefit to the series. The disorientation made you relate to the main character who didn't know what was going on half of the series. 
The characters: Ichise is a commendable and unique main character. He doesn't speak much yet his actions are more than enough for us to understand him. He was a huge plus point for me while watching this anime. He was so unlike any character of any anime I have ever seen. Flawed and savage yet at times calm and mysterious. Besides him the only other character I really liked or was intrigued by was Oonishi.  
Art/Sound: The art is similar to Serial Experiments Lain. The dark tones and random flashes of light were intriguing and didn't hinder my enjoyment of the show. The sound was excellent and succeeded in shrouding us in mystery, sadness, and intrigue. The opening and ending themes were good but the ending song for the last episode (the last 5 minutes of the series) blew my mind away. It was haunting and sad, the perfect personification of the series. 
This series has one of the most beautifully tragic endings in the history of anime. I won't spoil anything but I will say that the ending was very well executed and will require to have a tissue box. 
Though I have done nothing but praise the series, I will say that this is not an anime I will be re-watching anytime soon. It haunted me long after i finished it and left me in a somber mood. Its an anime that I will re-watch only when I want to show others.  
I recommend this for anyone who enjoys a dark, captivating and ultimately sad story. Despite its not so happy atmosphere, I feel that this is an anime that deserves more recognition if not for the story than for the characters.

    tl;dr...Texhnolyze is slow-paced, dark, satisfying, and beckons the question... what qualifies humanity? 
Warning: The content of this series is extremely mature and can be jarring.  Anybody who is overly sensitive towards violence, sex, nudity, and abuse, proceed with caution. 
This series is one that is difficult to describe with words, granted I will do my best.  This is because Texhnolyze is an experience.  The meaning of this series is derived from the character's struggles and the ability, as the viewer, to experience their inner turmoil and search for purpose along with them.  It delves deep into the core of the viewer and prompts the question: what is humanity?  This work is riddled with symbolism and motifs and can be labeled as ""artsy"" by many and as such, can be quite off-putting to some (especially considering the pacing).  
Story (9.7/10) 
The plot of Texhnolyze is quite simplistic in all honesty despite the complexity of following the involved parties, however, the manner in which it is portrayed is absolutely phenomenal (I mean that in both senses of the word; get it? senses?).  Human society has been driven underground and in order to survive and evolve, they have resorted to replacing lost body parts with machinery.  This process is referred to as texhnolyzation and raffia is utilized as ""fuel"" for the texhnolyzation process.  There are two echelons of society, the class and the citizens of Lux.  Within Lux, there are three organizations which are notable, the Organo, the Racan, and the Union.  The Organo is a band of basically political gang members whose primary goal is to preserve order in society and their own power.  The Racan is a band of Texhnolyzed ruffians whose primary goal is to be a hindrance to whichever influential organization they deem to be corrupt at the time.  Lastly, the Union is a group of Lux citizens whose primary goal is to fight against texhnolyzation in order to preserve humanity's purity.  The series follows their interactions with one another as well as with the class and the society above ground.  The pacing of the story is quite slow and some might argue that there is no story.  However, this just simply is not the case as the characters are dynamic and most definitely evolve as the plot develops.  I enjoyed the pacing, as it was exactly the correct speed to invoke realism and envelope the viewer in the fictional world.  Do no expect a happy go-lucky carefree story; the substance of the story is dark, serious, and extremely mature.  The ending is satisfying and there is a large amount of replay value. 
Art (9.8/10) 
I am no expert on early 2000's anime art quality, but I can say that I highly enjoyed the art in this series.  There seemed to be a tremendous amount of effort put into the backgrounds, settings, and the character's surroundings.  The characters were not exceptionally astounding with the exception of their eyes.  The eyes were not only realistic, unlike most anime, but also quite beautiful.  This is done purposefully, in my opinion, in order to portray the essence of humanity in all of its organic beauty, in contrast to the lifeless machinery elsewhere in their body or in their world.  The settings determine the mood of the series and there is a distinct difference in mood between above ground and below ground.  The most important aspect to me is that the art portrays the raw emotion present in the series quite flawlessly throughout. 
There are many times during this series where there is little dialogue.  This results in a large dependency on sound effects, music, and ambient noise.  If there is any area where texhnolyze is effective, it is most definitely the sound.  All three of these areas, I would argue, do not add to the mood or the feeling of the story, but rather dictate and establish them.  It is through these mediums that we come to know the characters and truly feel what they are experiencing.  This is most obvious in the ambient noise present when the viewer experiences the direct perspective of a texhnolyzed individual as there are distinct ambient noises constantly present in that individual's perception.  This is something that cannot effectively be communicated, but must be experienced.  There are few forms of expression more raw, honest, and pervasive than music.  It is a veritable painting for the ears. 
Character (9.5/10) 
Each and every character is given special care.  The writers wanted to understand their experiences and motivations for all of their actions, and as such their presentation to the viewer is, once again, raw.  There is little that can be assigned as arbitrary, unless, of course, you decide the entire story is arbitrary.  Practically each character is relatable in one way or another and it doesn't feel as though they are confined by the traditional archetypes of storytelling, which is a primary factor in achieving the level of realism present in this series.  Each character has to decide what they want to live for, their resolution towards achieving their goals, and ultimately, at what point has their spirit been broken.   
[Also, can I just say how happy I was that the men in this show do not fawn over women and chase them blindly, but rather evaluate their worth based on their character...] 
Enjoyment (9.4/10) 
Enjoyment of this show is a funny thing to rate because it is not really meant to be enjoyed, it is meant to be appreciated and understood... experienced, if you will (excuse my constant use of the term).  Instead of saying I enjoyed this series, I would rather say I was satisfied with it.  Enjoyment gets the lowest rating of all categories for me simply because it is almost impossible to truly ""enjoy"" this show unless you are a psychopath.  This makes it a large barrier for most viewers and even though compomrising this aspect would be largely compromising to all aspects of the experience, it is a pill that is difficult to swallow. 
Overall (9.7/10) 
The best anime I have seen to date. 
For anybody desiring a more in-depth thematic analysis I plan on writing one and posting it on my profile.

    Forewarning first; this anime is punishingly slow paced and worse, lingers into a confusing sequence of secondary character deaths in the middle before finally moving on again with the story. Texhnolyze has its share of action but this is heavily diluted by above mentioned story telling approach. 
So already, this is an anime that only a minority of people can get into. 
What it does excel in is its atmosphere. The anime starts off with masterful animation direction, detailed industrial backdrops, no dialogue aside from tortured breathing and a drained colour palette, if not outright darkness. The slow pacing; far from becoming a weakness, creates constant gut wrenching tension throughout the entirety of the show. This anime is no horror but it doesn't need to be; its guaranteed to be more unsettling than most horror. 
As you near the end of the show and with a mountain of named character deaths, doses of nihilistic philosophy, allusions to genocide, gang rapes and pedophilia; you will feel absolute and genuine despair. 
This anime really wasn't my cup of tea in the end but it made me its bitch. It is a one of a kind experience that forcefully seizes you by your figurative balls and doesn't let go until it has given you a taste of insanity. That alone puts this show above the typical 7/10 anime. 
On a more positive note, the Ost is amazing. Too good for any anime except this one, which it suits perfectly. There are the hauntingly beautiful ambient tracks; which I found the only respite from all the bleakness. There is the industrial opener which captures the setting of the show so well and finally, absolutely unrestrained free jazz rockers that teeter into Rock in Opposition territory. An avant-garde soundtrack for a one of a kind anime.

    The word “cyberpunk” has been synonymous within the anime and manga world and most of the media over the last 40+ years. Examples like the works of Philip K. Dick, William Gibson’s Neuromancer, Johnny Mnemonic, Metropolis, Akira, Battle Angel Alita, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell and The Matrix and it seems that most of these titles has been a bit of inspiration for today’s anime du jour but sometimes when you have a fascinating theme that can be entertaining in the eyes through visuals and storytelling, you accomplish something but let’s just get into the synopsis. 
The events take place in the vibrant yet dilapidated underground city of Lux. Denizens of Lux have come to call it ""The City"" and treat it as a sentient force. Three factions vie for control of the city: the Organo, a strictly professional conglomerate with ties to the criminal underworld in the prosthetics business (""Texhnolyze""); the Union, a fanatical populist group interfering with Organo's affairs; and Racan, a marauding group of Texhnolyzed youths. The series has an ensemble cast, but events particularly focus on Ichise, a stoic prize fighter who loses a leg and an arm to satisfy an enraged promoter; Onishi, a young but level-headed executive of the Organo who has many enemies; and Ran, a little girl who has a very important gift that affects the entire city. As they struggle to accept the challenges that they are dealt, the characters bear witness to major events that determine whether the city continues to exist. 
Now, this is a very gritty and complex story that I actually can see being made beautifully and graphically into something I can get with although it has been done before in most of the anime released but the main problem of this anime is that it has a very slow pace of storytelling and while most of the main characters represent some symbolic figures that bear these deep psychologies, motives and desires, they just seem too dull and uninteresting for me to care about. I can honestly say I have no feel or relation to any of these characters and I really hate to say this but most of the time I fell asleep through some of the episodes, which is a fail at my part due that this requires you to pay attention to the plot and may leave you to think at some parts and the animation has a bit to do with that, too. 
Yes, the animation of this is very dark, bleak, and has a depressing tone that perfectly matches this anime but its favorite colors happen to be black and grey and there is a bit too much of that color scheme. Also, there is to be minimal dialogue in some of the episodes (especially the first one) and some that I just can’t keep up with. 
I think the music has be the saving grace of this show. While it may something I expect from The Matrix movies, Juno Reactor’s “Guardian Angel (Xavier’s Edit)” has got to be one of the most energetic high-electronica songs I have ever heard and yeah, I love this song. As for the ending song by Gackt, it was fine. It wasn’t that great but it was suitable for the show. 
FINAL VERDICT: While having a story that is at first interesting but isn’t that unique anymore, they tried too hard to execute it and only manage to put some viewers to sleep, but then again, Texhnolyze isn’t the anime for everyone, just like Angel’s Egg but that anime is only 80 minutes in length while this is 22 episodes long and could have worked better as a movie. I will say this as a positive, this is highly recommended for anime fans have more of an artsy side of them and to those that want to learn all about this.

    Okay before i start this review i will say this now if you are not a fan of visual storytelling, anime that will keep you thinking throughout its entirety, and it has a dark tone throughout the entire series then this might not be for you, but if you can get past that and appreciate it then you will stumble upon a masterpiece Texhnolyze is a nihilistic dark tale that shows humanity at its end, i will tell you now that this series has no comedy whatsoever its almost like evangelion but with a more clear but more dreadful end this not a series about hope it is a series about death and as the series goes on you will understand that the first half (episodes 1-10) is very confusing and you won't really be getting whats going on the voice acting for the MC is also very rough around the beginning parts he doesn't say too much usually grunting and a few lines but besides that the story for Texhnolyze is simply amazing and in my opinion one of the best pieces of dark literature the first half was more of introducing the world,characters, and problems that each character would have to go through and after the first half the second half of Texhnolyze (episodes 11-22) blew me away there was so much development,more voice acting for the MC (lol),and the world building was well executed and just downright amazing the ending is also one of the most tragic endings i have ever seen in anything in general, the anime has many realistic human elements with each character for example ichise representing the will to live, ran representing the future etc. I rate this a 9/10 for the outstanding music,story,and characters even though the weakest point is the characters (i gave the characters an 8/10) the only reason i did this was not because they are bad characters or anything but because they feel so distant and maybe it was because of their ideologies but overall this series is a masterpiece and i recommend it to the strong willed.

    TEXHNOLYZE (This is the Anime Amino format as i find it very easy to use) 
Favourite Quotes-Inhumane and beautiful-slogan 
What I like-  the ending  
What I dislike- lack of protagonists dialogue. 
SETTING: the majority of this anime is situated in a dilapidated subterranean city known as Lux. On occasion though a surface area is hinted at.... 
PLOT OVERVIEW: In this city, three groups are prominent- The Oregano(a seemingly professional syndicate ), the Salvation Union(a group wholly opposed to the use of Texhnolyze limbs) and the Racan(a group of youths with Texhnolyzed limbs). In comes our exceptionally optimistic and talkative protagonist(sarcasm), the boxer Ichisee. After coming afoul of his fight promoter he has an arm and a leg cut off. However coincidentally just before bleeding to death a particularly odd young doctor decides to take him in and Texhnolyze his missing limbs, or in other words replace them with artificial robotic like pieces(kinda like automail in FMA). However, he just so happened to get the most advanced Texhnolyzation that was developed. As such Onishee of the Oregano decides to take him and use him as a handyman. This just turns out to drag him into a territory war with the other two groups. Throughout this he is also guided by a mysterious young girl named Ran who seems to know more about this war than anyone else 
ART/ANIMATION: A lot of people would pass on this because the art style seems very aged and quite dull, but that's the idea. The lack of lots of colour and the older style fit in with the plot and the setting perfectly. It really emphasises the lack of hope and optimism in the world. It's something similar to Ergo Proxy and Gilgamesh. Animation is a different story though. I can't say that it's done intentionally substandard for the sake of the anime. It's nothing you could consider dreadful, but there's nothing especially noteworthy either, with slow animation at times or just almost laggy (perhaps it was just the website I watched it on). Keep in mind that this was released in 2003 though so it's less than amazing animation is excusable 
SOUND/VOICES: The OST for Texhnolyze isn't really something you could sit down and listen to(imo) nor is it that memorable either. That doesn't mean it's not great though. In fact it really is,each tune is associated with a particular feeling-usually negative-and because of that has its own personality. The songs aren't just there to remove the silence, they really add a lot of emotion to the show and create the atmosphere in most scenes. It was composed by Hajime Mizoguchi and Keishi Urata. 
The voice acting is stellar too, both the dub and sub. There was not one person who sounded misplaced or forced. Everyone just went together. Personally I preferred the English version because there was a little more diversity in the cast and I just love Carrie Savage(Ran) and Victoria Harwood(the Doc). 
CHARACTERS:There's not too much I can say here without spoilers so I'll try just shorten it down. This isn't a show with a massive amount of forward character development. Instead we learn more about their pasts, motivations and goals, but most of them remain the same type of person throughout. There are some good and bad exceptions to this. The Doc is one of the few characters that changes over the course of the show, and not simple goal changes or feelings but she slowly begins to become a new person which I loved. The opposite can be said for the protagonist Ichisee. We are given almost all the information we need about him early on and that's all. Following that his intentions are never clear and neither are his reasons for anything he does. He is just the embodiment of human will to survive. That's an interesting thing on is own but is annoying at times. Also he pretty much doesn't speak. 
CONCLUSION:Texhnolyze is an unmarked jewel in the treasure trove of anime and sadly so. It's ost, unique characters, enthralling story and fascinating art style all add up to make this a stupendously good show but very few watch it from what I can tell. I really do recommend it so long as you don't mind slow build ups. All the negatives are hugely outweighed by the positives and can be easily ignored once you get into it.

    I wanted to write a review about this anime for a while, just never got around to do doing it.  
Texhnolyze..Jesus man, talk about a bummer.  
This is the most depressing anime I've watched. I don't know what to compare it to to be honest because I've watched nothing that I can consider it similar to. Maybe like Ergo Proxy or Lain? But even then the only relation is the atmosphere.  
The story is really heavily layered and complex, and if I were to start explaining it I would be giving away spoilers. I honestly don't know how you can write a review for this anime without revealing spoilers. 
Me giving you a plot summary means nothing because it doesn't cover anything, but at the most basic level it's about this city of Lux and different organizations fighting over control of areas. That's all I can safely say without spoilering anything. 
Honestly the art, story, sound and characters are all fantastic. I really don't know what else to say, how do people do this without revealing spoilers for fucks sake.  
It's depressing, it's cyber-punk, it's dark, it doesn't give a fuck what you think, it's a masterpiece.

    I remember watching this when I was younger and I think maybe because of my immature mind at the time I was more fascinated by the different color schemes, camera shots and the overall animation and feel. The story in and of itself took a back seat. Coming back and being able to understand the actual story I can say it is by no means a bad story the only issue to me is the pacing. Character progression is slow and there are numerous episodes where the story stagnates with in my opinion meaningless scenes that you can take out and it won't be taking anything away from the story. Now I mean some people might like this type of pacing and if that is your cup of tea then I highly recommend this anime, because it takes great care in establishing the atmosphere and the setting and building up characters from the ground up though I do think sometimes it is a bit redundant. That being said I recommend you watch it just to see if it is right for you and if you reach the 7th to 9th episode mark and your not yawning and fighting sleep like me then I recommend you continue because the story and everything are almost perfect but as I said to me the pacing was the one glaring issue.

    In the analysis of Dr Schreber, Freud makes the claim that hallucinations are a positive sign in the treatment of schizophrenic patients, for the reason that the hallucinations evidence the mind processing & working through whatever its underlying pathology may be. In properly systemic thinking, Freud's lessons come into play in a show such as this, where a systemic entity, a city, goes through the same convulsions of a mind, the underlying pathologies, the systems of the city, working themselves out via the bloody spectacle that takes up the runtime. In proper Cybernetic analysis, Lukuss is given to as a system, inhuman machines commanding and controlling the bodily understructure, the base of labor, humanity. The plot is broadly, these systems disintegrating to a terminal end by their mechanics being forced to act and thus terminate the very things which make their functioning. This top-down root of destruction is evident in the main antagonist, who brings about the final death in much the same way, attempting to construct a modernist outside-text, in the vein of a fascism or communism, to bring about some perfection of society. He fails and in doing so only causes more decline, sparking the destruction of the very system he sits atop, the class. The protagonist fades out watching colored lights from his arm, those of his mother, as his mother rests as a ghost, immortal in the ""land of the dead"", the literal overworld, superstructure. 
Texhnolyze is an anime about death, about the failure of a corpus, a system, and its final decline until all that remains are the overground ghosts, living a half-existence forever, like the paintings and images live on when the body has been long destroyed by time. In proper fashion of melancholic media, much of the screentime is taken up with atmospherics, with the run-time greatly extended by beautiful ambient scenes intercut between the shots.

    Texhnolyze.  I didn't enjoy this series very much.  The story and characters were decent or rather scary really.  This story revolves around, fate, loathing, and fear.  The atmosphere was dark and moody.  The story also goes into cybernetically enhanced humans or cyborgs with texhnolyze technology.  It raises a good question, can technology destroy everything?  Perhaps, but it can also be used for much good. 
This series had very little talking and tried to let the visuals do the talking.  This is fine for a little while, but it's like listening to hours and hours of classical music.  Words can mean so much more and help you not to be bored.  This series also had a lot of violence and no sense of humor or comedy. 
Fate has its place, but decisions still determine destiny.  This was a disappointing anime series to me.  Remember the importance of weight in action.

    I wanted to leave a short review for my favorite anime of all time. Of all the title's I've ever seen, never before did any form of art or entertainment ever expunge the concept of ""futility in existence"" as this masterpiece did to me. Overall a depressing and exquisitely intriguing environment and plot. Filled to the brim with dark and mature concepts. Definitely not for everyone. While it is my favorite anime of all time, the characters are mostly static, and wholly uninteresting in any other setting than the one specifically made for them. The characters are simply telling a story rather than making one themselves. If your looking for a story which requires intense thought, you come to Texhnolyze, but if you're looking for a character-builder, well, there's plenty of other titles for you. 
I would also mention that it is slow so that you can fully absorb the environment and artwork put into it. It's pretty cool to me that they made the exposition slow. Really calmed me actually.

    Warning: Possible Spoilers ahead. I don't directly talk about any plot points but it would be better if you watch the series first before reading. 
T E X H N O L Y Z E 
""Not with a bang, but a whimper"" This quote describes Texhnolyze perfectly, at least in my interpretation of the series. In fact, it wouldn't  be too much of a stretch for me to say that it IS Texhnolyze. The Hollow Men by T.S. Eliot and Texhnolyze are one in the same. They are both loneliness, death, and overall nihilism incarnate, and I got a similar feeling while reading and watching both, and it wouldn't surprise me if Abe and the writers of the show were inspired by it. 
Texhnolyze is the last of the 4 great Abe shows (Serial Experiments Lain, Niea_7, and Haibane Renmei) and it is one hell of an end. The series centers on a former prizefighter, Ichise who is wrapped up in the workings of a mobster-esk world while gradual decay of humanity ensues. It is overall a series about death and loneliness, it tells the story of the end of the world, and rather than having a huge apocalyptic event wipe out humanity, it shows a grinding, slow decay of the world. While most shows have a beginning, middle, and end, Texhnolyze felt like one long end. A lingering dark road that ultimately trails off into nothingness, and everything in the show collaborates to accentuate this. 
The character designs were done by one of my favorite artists, Yoshitoshi Abe, and boy do they reflect his style. Abe's art always manages to capture a feeling of loneliness. He usually draws characters alone, with detached expressions, using thin, pencil-like outlines and detail work to create a very organic, but unsettling feeling from his art. It's very different from the thick outlines and hard angles that have become characteristic of anime. The background's are also drawn in a way to create atmosphere. The city of Lukus is drawn with detail, but is fairly washed out and often cast in harsh white light, really giving the world an empty feeling. The show very rarely shows wide shots of the city, it mostly shows small areas of the city with characters isolated within the frames. There are very rarely background characters shown, and when they are show they are just as detached as the rest of the other characters. The dark, empty art serve as solid base for the atmosphere. 
The sound of the series however, is where the real meat of Texhnolyze's atmosphere strikes. It starts with an opening by Juno Reactor, Guardian Angle, a high energy intense techno piece that gets you hyped for the series. It then immediately kicks that feeling of energy in the balls by cutting to dark slow background noise and a dialogue-empty first episode. Something striking about Texhnolyze it's very little dialogue. There are few monologues, and most character interaction is done through body language. But the gaps in dialogue are filed with a utterly gorgeous sound track that fits with every scene of the series. The violence is accented with gritty high energy techno music, while slower scenes are complemented by slow, instrumental songs that draw you in. Each song of the soundtrack works on its own as well as with the series. But the real musical hight of the series is the ending theme,  Tsuki no Uta, a gorgeous acoustic guitar and string quartet piece with melancholic vocals that perfectly captures the tone of the series. Needless to say, I am absolutely in love with Texhnolyze's soundtrack. 
The art and sound create and amazing atmosphere but unfortunately the story and characters in the show fall flat in comparison, especially with the characters acting so detached all of the time. Nothing good ever happens in Texhnolyze, and this is where it runs into problems. Because it is so bleak it will turn most people away from it within the first 5 minutes of the first episode. Sitting through Texhnolyze can be an absolutely EXCRUCIATING experience, especially of you haven't watched anything so bleak before, like End of Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain, or Grave of the Fireflies, which all don't really even touch Texhnolyze's depression. The characters are constantly going through absolute hell, all while giving you very little to like about them. That's not to say they don't play interesting roles. Characters who are introduced as villains end up being the more likeable and morally grounded, and characters who are introduced as good at first end up being some of the most compelling antagonists in anime. But there's so lttle contrast between the morality of the series. While grey morality can make shows more interesting, Texhnolyze is really more like totally black morality, or at least a very VERY dark shade of grey, leaving nothing but oversaturation of despair. 
Even though the characters do have their fair share of badass moments, they are incredibly hard to relate to, because no one does anything good. That's why I could only recommend Texhnolyze to very certain people who are in a very certain kind of mood. This is not an anime for beginners and I understand why it is so unpopular and why it is received so negatively. I can even understand hating Texhnolyze. But that's how Texhnolyze manages to be so amazing. It throws convention to the wind and excels in a way that calling anti-mainstream just doesn't do justice to. It's characters are too detached to really get behind or relate too, it's story is pretty simple, though it is told in a weird, hard to describe way, and it's merits as a narrative are entirely lacking. But while Texhnolyze is not good on the surface level, it reaches DEEP down into it's themes and presentation in a way that I don't think any anime has ever done before. Sure, it could be a technically BETTER show, but that's not what it's going for, that's not it's identity. 
It's loose narative strenght makes it a different experience for everyone who watches it, and what you think of the series really depends on who you are as a person. The reason Texhnolyze manages to be compelling for me is that it is the story of the human race. The characters and setting are really just examples. The story didn't have to be told from their perspective, they just happened to be the ones that lasted the longest in a dying world. 
As I said before, there is no beginning or middle, only the end. When the lights dim out and the curtains close it is over. Purely, and starkly OVER. The story doesn't continue after you stop watching, the world doesn't continue to grow, everything ends. It is the latermost end, it leaves no speculation about future events. 
Texhnolyze tells a story that few would even dare to experience, it's alot to take in. The show makes you ask hard questions about the world and people around you, and more importantly, about yourself. But rather than asking directly and spouting philosophical monolouge, you find yourself asking these questions out of your own introspection after watching it. Most people will drop it at the thought of these questions, and I don't blame them, but those who finish it, and appreciate it, will look at things a bit differently afterwords. While Texhnolyze is dark, disturbing, distant, depressing, and plenty of other words that start with 'D', but when you get to the end there's a certain other feeling that comes on. Not a depressing or tragic feeling, but more like sense of melancholy. Texhnolyze reminds us that we will all die eventually, weather we're ready or not, and that we will lose people we love during our life. When characters die it feels less like someone is murdered or taken before their time, it feels like they die after a long life, doing all they can, and it is satisfying. Despite meeting a sad and disturbing end, Texhnolyze leaves you with a feeling of catharsis; the human race finally goes to sleep after the struggle, after fighting, kicking, and screaming, we all secede to the eternal slumber. There's something comforting about Texhnolyze's nihilism. Knowing that you will die, though scary at first, can make it easier to come to terms with the hardships of life. When we lose someone we love, when we feel alone, when we feel the weight of the world, we know that at least somethings are out of our control. If there is one thing we can rely on absolutely, it's death, and we could all use something to rely on. Death is overall a part of life and life is beautiful. Texhnolyze is beautiful.

    First review. But won't go into any detail on this series.  
My advice is to go in with little knowledge of the story and if you find yourself bored or frustrated with the first couple of episodes, then strive through them and asses the series by ep 8. If by then your not enjoying the series, id suggest dropping it.  
A choice i made years ago after only viewing the first 2 episodes. I put it on the back burner for 6-7 years..  
My advice for all adult anime viewers - is to give this series a good shot. Its atmospheric and use of imagery, to tell the story, is something I've never witnessed done so uniquely in a anime. Its really something pretty special. Try to watch in the best quality possible too.

    Texhnolyze is brutal; brutal to watch.  
Calling it brutal is no insult; rather an understatement. So why would you ever watch this anime? Or rather, how is it possible to enjoy such an anime? This anime is not out here to impress you, nor is it out here to make you hate it either. Texhnolyze, I’d argue, has a very rare and overlooked element that isn’t particularly present in a lot of media. It is pure in a sense of its stark portrayal of a violent, dystopian future where nothing is left and yet people still cling to life even if they have no other reason to. This anime isn’t by any means for everyone. It’s essentially a tone piece that can understandably be off-putting for people looking for something with a lot more going on at a faster pace. There is very sparse dialogue present in some instances throughout which, accompanied by its slow pacing, can bore some viewers. In fact, the first episode doesn’t have an ounce of dialogue for almost 10 whole minutes. This however is done with good intentions. Each shot is done to help connect and immerse the viewer into the agonising world that Texhnolyze takes place in—a broken down city by the name of Lux, which can be seen as an analogy for hell. 
— Story — 
In terms of a narrative, I would argue this isn’t one of Texhnolyze’s strengths, which in effect contributes to its many other strengths, particularly its atmosphere and presentation. If you’re here to look for a narrative driven anime, then this is probably not for you. A lot of what makes this anime special are the themes present throughout. Two prominent recurring themes throughout Texhnolyze are nihilism and purpose; trying to understand one’s purpose and reason for continuing to exist when everything has fallen apart. There’s very little exposition present in Texhnolyze, as such encouraging the viewer to reach their own conclusions and meaning. It has a lot to say about evolution, politics, morality and order, however isn’t feeding you the information directly. Texhnolyze is not a tale about hope or rebirth in the evolution of humanity, but rather its death. It’s one of the first times I’ve seen an anime go against the grain so much that it became visceral to watch knowing that despite its sci-fi setting, is a potential direction for mankind’s future. 
— Art — 
The art/animation is arguably one of Texhnolyze’s strengths in executing the tone it portrays. There’s a saturation of color present throughout almost the anime’s entirety, as well as an exposing glow emitting from the sky that resembles the sun’s glare. The design of Lux can be seen as or similar to a brutalist, an architectural term that describes structures being strictly made of concrete, which contributes to the lack of color present throughout. The presence of darker and more sombre hues accompanies it in painting a grim and bleak atmosphere. The only color to really stand out is red; the color of blood, as violence and death is a recurring theme throughout Texhnolyze. Every background character looks understandably miserable with lack of expression, body language and interaction as though they have given up hope but continue to live under no one's will. It captivates a portrait of despair and suffering better than any anime I’ve consumed. A major reason for catching my attention was due to its cover art, which is illustrated by Yoshitoshi ABe (Serial Experiments Lain, Haibane Renmei and NieA_7). 
— Sound — 
“If there’s anything you want, anything at all… come to me; your guardian angel”.  
Hearing those words at the beginning of every episode sends shivers down my spine. For me, Texhnolyze’s use of sound is quite odd and unconventional. I was always intrigued by its opening and its style, though what I was more intrigued by was the choice of song used. The opening is done by Juno Reactor, which is rather unconventional for an anime opening due to its lack of vocals and its use of ambient, electronic beats, though is somewhat understandable for a cyberpunk setting. That, in contrast to its ending, is quite an eccentric choice. Going from a visually abstract opening with an electronic song choice to a visually barebones acoustic ending done by Gackt was questionable, though I’m quite certain that I enjoy it despite how out of place it is. Its soundtrack is also a different beast, being primarily grunge rock and some instances of soothing piano, acoustic or other various instruments composed by Hajime Mizoguchi (who also composed music for Escaflowne and Jin-Rou) and Keishi Urata. That being said, most of it is quite inconsistent and truly tries to shoehorn as much styles and sounds as much as possible, which I find to be an interesting choice as there are various different sounds for only one real present tone. This isn’t by any means a bad decision, however. 
— Comparison(s) — 
For the purpose of its existence, it’s hard to compare it to other anime that exist for the same reason. Texhnolyze is unique, though it can be said that it draws some resemblance to the Ghost in the Shell movie with the use of cybernetics and how that, in a philosophical perspective, can enhance or hurt a society. I wouldn’t call it a fair comparison, though it does carry a similar setting presented differently from different ends of the same spectrum. It is said to be part of the “Yoshitoshi ABe trilogy” which includes Serial Experiments Lain and Haibane Renmei. Texhnolyze is also written by Chiaki J. Konaka, who also did writing for Serial Experiments Lain, Digimon Tamers and The Big O. If you've seen any of Konaka's work, then this is a must watch. 
— Enjoyment — 
There were some instances in this anime where the pacing felt rather slow and made some questionable decisions, primarily towards the end. I can only handpick a few of things that I disliked about Texhnolyze that I’m unable to say due to the protection of spoilers. If you like post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk sci-fi anime, you will probably enjoy this. If you like sombre atmospheres and want to watch humanity fall apart, you will probably enjoy this. If you’re looking for fast paced action or a fixed meaning derived from its narrative, you may not enjoy this. I would say it’s worth giving a chance if you’re looking for something unique and different. Personally, it’s an esoteric anime, which can be quite a hit or miss. You’re either going to be lured by its presentation or you are going to become bored with it. 
— Conclusion — 
Texhnolyze was an experience that I had put off for quite a long time but glad to have felt. It was agonising and crushing, though I may just be masochistic to endure it. Its philosophy and psychology alone may be worth dabbling in if you’re interested in human behaviour or how a society operates and can quickly crumble into anarchy. It’s worth noting that nothing good comes from this anime. If you are looking for anything other than to see the world fall apart then you will be sorely disappointed.  
I give this anime a light to decent 9. Its experimentation and presentation was something that I could personally find enjoyment in, even at times where I felt it was a little deficient and lacking in certain areas. Regardless, I would consider any word you’ve heard of this anime to be untrustworthy. This is something you can only truly experience for yourself to form an opinion on. I can only hope your experience will be as unique and griping as mine was. 
Light to decent 9.

    This is the most unique show I've ever seen. Story and Setting elaborate precisely, and it is solid style. 
I'm surprised that Madhouse made this show in good meaning. There is a strong impact potentially. 
Nevertheless, I think that this show's attraction can't communicate by above. Let's talk this show right away. 
In the near future, Mankind continued to become evolving by prosthesis technology called 'Texhnolyze'. 
However, many violent organization including Organo devastates the city in order to new revolution. 
The person who appeared in there is Ichise. He lost right arm and left foot in a certain affair. 
Ichise came to life barely by Texhnolyze, and he moves for stop the city's collapse. This is basic synopsis. 
Since plot is very esoteric and complicated, even for mistakes, please forgive me. 
People who avoid this show after watching first episode will many. Dialogues have very little. Even Ichise don't speak. 
Individual settings become reveal little by little since episode 2, and dialogues also particularly increase. So first episode is substantially tutorial. 
I get involved as of first episode because I love serious shows. but atmosphere is very dark. You don't want to continue watching unless something unusual happens. 
Don't give up. 2-cour shows expand gradually. This show also part of it. 
After that Episode 7 on the street is main scenario. whether put up with until then. It is essential. 
When I'm talking in this show, indispensable element is characters psychological description. 
Goes without saying Ichise, Ran and other characters are full of mysteries. To understand their internal conditions are time-consuming. 
Description is nothing. If you can't follow characters conversation, you'll leave you behind. 
For the purpose of giving room of consideration, whole composition purposely is unkind. 
""I don't get it."" I have no choice that get caught up thing like this. This show is outstanding clearly from traditional shows. 
If you completely understand this show, this show becomes interesting in one go. There is subtle charm. 
The more you understand, the more you will understand Ran's identity, you'll see that Texhnolyze conflict is ugly and waste. 
Animation's beauty is astonishing. It's very match with dark moods. 
Character design also distinctive. Especially shape of eyes and whole clothes. Hairstyle is matter of preference. 
Judging from the nature of this show, bloody scenes and violence are many. You should attention if you don't like them. 
OP and ED animation is very impressive and deep combined with songs. I like Ichise and Ran's eyes met them. I'll be your guardian angel... 
Voice acting is first-class. You feel like pulled into this show. 
As stated previously, story is esoteric. To come to the point, it is high hurdle. 
I've watched some shows who similar to Texhnolyze. Of course, this show is no exception. 
Hidden excellent show. This show is extremely great.

    Texhnolyze is not the type of anime you watch for fun. It's the type of anime that'll have you thinking all along the series (also because many details are not explained) and leave you a bad taste in the mouth. It's the type of anime you can't watch in one go because of it's slow-paced and not consistent enough plot.  
-Story (9/10): 
The story is what makes Texhnolyze appealing and worth watching. It turns around the young price-fighter Ichise, in an underground city called Lux, who loses an arm and a leg after hitting (who I suppose is) his boss. Limping through the city, with no one to come to his aid, he collapses on a stairway. There, Kamata Eriko (the Doc) finds him and uses him to improve the tecnology of 'texhnolization' and gets his new limbs. Taken under Onishi's (the leader of the Organo, the city's main powerholder) care, he will get involved in a war for the control of the city. Meeting Ran, a girl who can see the possible future, he will get to know his destiny and walk straight to it while he fights for survival. 
The problem with this anime is the lack of proper explanation and dialogue. In the first couple of chapters the amount of dialogues can be counted with one hand, and the only explanations you'll get are the couple of flashbacks here and there. 
-Art (8/10): 
It's the kind of realistic-looking style, which reminds of animes such as Ergo Proxy. The design and colours are very gloomy and 'dry', suiting perfectly to the story. However, it's nothing special. 
-Sound (6/10):  
With the near to inexistence of BGM and the boring ED, there's not much to say. The sound of the anime itself is very low. It's quite messed up. 
-Characters (8/10): 
All characters are too superficial: there is hardly no psychological progress whatsoever, and apart from a couple of details, the characters' background is to the biggest part unknown.  
However, almost every character's personality was interesting on his own way. For example, you have Yoshii, who appears to be a normal traveler, but turns out to be totally abnormal (further details would be considered spoiler) or Ran, who appears to be just a curious little girl who doesn't talk, but turns out to be of great importance.  
-Enjoyment (7/10):  
Truth to be said, I didn't really enjoy it. Not mentioning the slow pace of the story, it was a bit too serious and realistic (for example the reactions of the normal people towards Ichise as he stumbles through the city), almost depressing. But it was a great change from the typical mainstream crap and although it wasn't the best, it certainly wasn't the worst. 
-Overall (8/10):  
Do I recommend this series? Yes and no. This is not the kind of anime that'll raise in popularity, simply because it's no fun. If you're looking for a good time, feel free to skip this one. However, if you're looking for a good story or you want to run away a bit from the mainstream stuff, go ahead and give it a try. It's worth your time. 
Hope this helped you make up your mind. Thank you for your attention.

    Texhnolyze is by no means an easy show to review, since it differentiates greatly from the established norm. If an average, run-of-the-mill show glorifies victory and personal triumph, then Texhnolyze will be the antithesis of that; celebrating defeat and personal setbacks. Though one thing is for sure, the show is mainly targeted towards mature viewers, and it requires some degree of thought to appreciate its offerings. 
The general plot revolves around Lux, an underground city that is embroiled in constant conflict between three factions. The Organo is a consortium that has close ties to the underworld and a monopoly on prosthetic technology (Texhnolyze), tied together by bureaucracy and intrinsic greed. While the Union is a hive of fanatics that seeks to destroy the aforementioned technology, but in reality they are just searching for an outlet to blame for the hardships in Lux. Lastly, the Racan is formed by wandering vagabonds who sought to seize their place in the power struggle, though mostly a bunch of egocentric individuals who huddled together in the false sense of security. 
In between the maddening chaos, our protagonist Ishise – a ring fighter out on his luck, must seek his own salvation in the guidance of Ran – a seer from the city’s outskirts that has the gift of precognition. 
The pacing of this anime is methodically slow, but this is a necessity to erect the sense of desolation and despair. Some reviewers may disagree with me, but I compare this to the fermentation process in wine making, where a certain level of patience is required to perceive its flavour. Scenes might seem disjointed at first, but each tiny silver, every little splinter would come together eventually in revealing their connections and underlying messages. 
The characters are well designed, as expected of works by Yoshitoshi Abe. Some people may argue on how silent and nihilistic they were, but I merely believe that to be an aspect of Lux that has rubbed off on them. Viewers should have focused on the significance of their futile struggles, and how they became triumphs of the show. Onishi knew the peace was short lived despite his best attempts, but in believing his duty to the city, he fought on regardless of the outcome. The Doc knew humanity was on the exit stage, that as well as the city around her, but she did her best in advancing the Texhnolyze technology; hoping to steer the trend. Shinji knew his rudimentary gang was no match in a proper fight, but he did his best in leading and protecting his subordinates, even when the odds were stacked against him. Yoshii may not have the best mindset to right all the wrongs in Lux, but he was convicted in his task on bringing about change, to spur others into action. 
The series is badly underrated and deserves a viewing from anyone interested in Japanese animation. I would suggest applying the three episode rule here for measures, as that would have been fairer than to discard this excellent show merely on initial impressions.

    The story is about a guy with some speech impairment that is really into punching. At first he kinda sucks and fails a lot, failing sometimes means getting hit by swords too, but he struggles and later he gets very good at punching and do that for living. He truly punches till the end. 
He barely say any words through the whole series, he is more about grunting and screaming, he kinda just want to throw some punches randomly. It's by episode 10 that he starts acting less like a rabid dog and more like semi functional and emotionally unstable human being. It's good that even him can't comprehend his motivations, cause it's very hard to find a more obnoxious protagonist. 
The main female character don't fall behind, she also barely say any word and barely do anything. Actually, not many people say much stuff, there wasn't much more than four full sentences in the whole first episode, it was more about very long and slow scenes and gruntings and intense breathing and some screams... the first episode was supposed to get you hooked in the series, right? Well, here the first episode is more like ""gosh, I guess I will give one more chance before dropping this"", and you probably will do cause the art, animation and the music is quite good. 
Ok, the scenario you have a city where the Organo, a mafia syndicate, runs the ""raffia"" mines for the Class, and kinda controls the city. The several factions in the Organo don't get along too well... you also have the Alliance, a kinda religious militia against texhnolyzation (I didn't mention it yet, it's like getting robotic parts for your body) and you also have the Racan, an independent street gang that won't take shit from anyone... outside the city there is the Gabe, a kind of religion sect too but that try to stay out of the city business... there is more to it but I won't spoil. 
There is some quite decent interactions between those five factions, also some quite good stuff going on, but as Lain (where most of the guys here also worked) the story is soooo slow paced that the whole series would probably fit in a single movie and that movie would be awesome. The story goes like ""in this episode the guy is lost"", ""in this episode the guy is in pain"", ""in this episode the guy is confused"", rarely more than one thing happens in an episode... it changes by the mid of the series when shit goes down but it becomes sloooow again in the end, like, even the walking is slow... you see? That's all to add deepness, Texhnolyze went so deep that they found oil and now USA wants to bring freedom to it! 
But again, you see, this reviews makes the series look very boring but pay attention that I gave an overall score of 8. It's not just art and music that's good, 'cause the story goes so crazy that it gives a Kubricks feeling, by the end it becomes so insane that they are now going balls deep... can you feel it? Sense!? We don't need any!! We are pure art yo!!! ... no... seriously... the story develops slowly, but it's so fucked up that you will get frustrated 'cause you just can't imagine what's going to happen, and the ending will give an emptiness feeling, and I think it's very positive - to not be apathetic about it. 
Maybe it's pretentious, most probably it is very pretentious most of the time, the slow pace is annoying, but maybe you will be amazed by their ""artistry"" (if you liked shit like David Lynch's Eraserhead). There is some good action, but I really liked the unpredictable plot, but I also kinda hated the whole thing as you can see by my review... 
One last rock I have to throw is about the last music, it's horrible... if you can't write a song in english don't try, writting in japanese and doing a sloppy literal translation and singing it in weird tempos to fit the sentences in the music is awful... it's sad 'cause the rest of the music in the series were quite good.

    Texhnolyze is a weird show. I'll be honest, I'm writing this a good 6 months after I finished it but I honestly think it's better this way. There was a lot to digest for me and I think I can finally rate this show without having the bias I had when I first finished it. 
Firstly I will say reviews are almost meaningless with this show. As many have said and many will continue to say Texhnolyze isn't for everyone. Bleak, slow, dialogue heavy, and incredibly deep, Texnolyze will make most people who try to watch it turn away before they finish. That's less of a warning to you all and more of a statement. It's the only 10 I would never recommend to someone. 
Now for the ratings: 
Story (10/10): 
This is in my opinion Texhnolyze's strongest area. There are so many facets to the story and it's done so well that you feel almost apart of it. Every layer that you break through is greeted with another layer. The world doesn't just seem alive, it seems to be living beyond the story that is told. You aren't a member of the story, you are an observer, more so than other anime. That was my favorite part of it all. 
Art (6/10) : 
Simply put the art style works with the theme but it's not the best I've ever seen. It ages alright and there are some truly beautiful scenes in it but it's something I never really got used to until the last few episodes. This isn't exactly a bad thing depending on what you're looking for but make sure you know that this is a pretty old show. 
Sound (10/10): 
The second best part of the show for me. The sound was perfect. It's not beautiful like Ghibli films or epic like battle shonens but it fits the puzzle that is Texhnolyze. It's weird and foreign sounding and leaves you at ease a large amount of the time but that's exactly what is needed to push the atmosphere of the show to the fullest. There is once piece near the end that still gives me chills listening to it.  
Character(10/10): 
There are so many. Everyone with a name is important. Everyone you meet plays a role. This ties in to what I was saying about how the world isn't just alive but lives on beyond what you see. Each character is multifaceted and could each be the protagonist if the show was written that way. By the end I honestly didn't know who I was rooting for let alone who I should be rooting for. They were all written very well. 
Enjoyment (5/10): 
I'll be honest, I didn't really enjoy this anime. That's why I feel it's better that I waited so long to write a review. The show is heavy. I personally couldn't watch more than a few episodes per day. I never really felt happy during my watch. I was amazed and impressed by the work and I respect just how well made it is but to say I enjoy it would be incorrect. Again this isn't a bad thing, it's just how I viewed the show.  
Overall (10/10): 
Texhnolyze is amazing. In terms of story telling and character design it's one of the best shows I've ever seen, period. To be honest I've seen people hype it up as this super depressing anime that will leave your life in a wreck. It's not that. The way I describe it to other is, for the few days after I finished Texhnolyze I didn't feel depressed or upset. I had the same feeling you get 6 months after your dog dies and you remember that they aren't there anymore and it just slowly ruins your day for you. It's subtle. It's not a depression, just a feeling of longing for something you lost. The show itself is slow, ESPECIALLY THE FIRST EPISODE! Make sure you get passed it. It has maybe 6 or 7 lines of dialogue but the entire show isn't like that.  
Well to anyone who read this entire thing I appreciate it. This is my first real review so it could probably have been done much better so I'll work on it. Thank you for your time :)

"34","Joby05","1011","
    Ok... so I will be straight up. This might be an anime that is too smart for me. Here is the problem... I think I am fairly smart and really tried to pay attention. Said a different way... this comes across a bit pretentious in that it doesn't hold the viewers hand AT ALL. Like... there is subtle, hidden, and then this which is something FAR more difficult to understand. By the halfway point I really didn't understand this anime much at all. It goes out of it's way to not explain things, relationships, or really much of anything. In an attempt to be subtle and edgy it just becomes confusing and a hot mess. I can see that it did a LOT of things right and it's world and tone are very interesting... if only it would explain a lot more, not try to shroud most things for a ""big reveal"" at the end and it might be pretty good.  
Also... I think my main issue was at the end nothing was really solved, I was still left not really understanding the relationship between most people and major and I mean MAJOR plot points went so far over my head I was just left confused and frustrated. You can't get emotionally connected if you're just confused the whole time. This is a miss for me though some people may really like it if they are able to get it.

      Texhnolyze is an anime about... many things. We explore themes like body modification or destiny and we are asked questions like “what makes us human ?” or “what part of me, is Me?”. It’s a wild and... painful ride, but the one that sticks in your head for a long time. 
  Story: 
The story is impressively multithreaded, we get an impression, that we are spectators of every important action in this city. Even though, we understand very little, things “happen” all the time, we are bombarded with action and plot, but... it’s quite hard to find a whole in it. Social structure of Lux is quite complex and misterius, every time we get an answer for our question, another question pops out. It creates a constant need to explore and try to understand this world, and also unstoppable urge to watch next episode… This tale grabs your throat and refuse to loosen a grip, even after finishing a show… 
  Characters: 
The cast is really wide and diverse. We are able to meet people from vastly different environments and with vastly different nature, and hear their problems and worldviews. Front characters are complex and… deep. They struggle in this god-forsaken world, encounter horrific events and fight with each other, and with themselves. The chaos and injustice pushes many to abandon their morals and humanity itself. Although setting is futuristic, humans are not freed from eternal struggles, they have more on their backs than ever before, and barely move forward. 
  Art: 
The art is… normal. It’s maintained in very dark and realistic fashion. We see a lot of contrast and mainly brownish colors. It’s not technically great, we won’t see amazingly animated fights or astonishing landscapes. Art is more like a mood-creator and when it can’t escape criticism as a separate doing, it can definitely pass as a part of a great whole. 
  Music: 
It’s amazing. Really, we have a ton of different styles, from acoustic guitar, through great classical-like pieces,to alien sounding, experimental, drone music. This OST can be easly prised as a standalone album, but with visuals…Ahh! Every part fits perfectly - on the streets of Lux, full of poor ,we will mostly hear acoustic guitar, in dark canals underground the city - drone, when looking at the “high class” of the city - piano pieces. Music not only represents places or people, but also emotions and mood. The silence can’t go unmentioned too, it’s used very wisely and never fails to build tension or emphasize atmosphere. 
   
  Show doesn’t try to appeal to everyone, it doesn’t try to reveal all it’s secrets or even “make sense” in logical terms all the time. It’s more about ideas and mood than factual events. It never fails to surprise and intrigue. It forces to reflection, ask questions, gives different perspectives, but never reveals its own...

    This is my very first anime review, so please bear with me if something seems wrong or out of place, or if my grammar seems off. Its my first review and I'm not that experienced in reviewing. It's probably a bit messy an unorganized, so please forgive me if it seems bad. 
In the animated series Texhnolyze, the main character has to live the rest of his life with a cyber kinetic armed that was ""Tehnolyzed"" to him after a prostitute has his arm chopped off for refusal to have sex with her when she attempts to stab him in the during the intercourse. There is little to No dialouge for the most of the first couple of episodes, in order for the narrative to take on a more ""avant garde"" style of story telling. The viewer is forced to try and think for theirselves about what is going on. The story later has a narrative that is still somewhat unique, but starting away from the complex storytelling style from the beginning arc. The story begins to focus on the character and his journey and conflicts he faces in a corrupted underground city built to separate the the Tehnolyzed and the human. It becomes progressively darker than even the first arc, and focuses on themes of war, terrorism, philosophy and government, and also contains disturbing imagery and complex symbolism throughout. There is an aggregated cast of characters, but later on, the story becomes more focused on the main character ichise and the struggles he constantly faces for the consequences of being  Texhnolyzed. This is quite possibly  one of the darkest series ever made and is highly reccomended for any anime watcher that is into maturity, experimental storytelling and artistic approach in writing style.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (Spoiler warning posted further down) 
Texhnolyze is a discussion about nihilism, in a multitude of contexts. From a micro-personal level, to a macro-existential level. Even saying that much could be considered a massive spoiler, so I should probably put out a spoiler warning right off the bat. I don't think it's possible to discuss this anime with any substance without at least recognizing several aspects of the last couple episodes. For a generic, spoiler free review, I can just say that it has my absolute highest recommendation. If you like philosophical masterpieces like Evangelion and Lain, this is for made for you. To the review: 
* * SPOILER WARNING * * (I'm literally gonna spoil the entire thing!) 
Ichise, the main character, is the physical embodiment of human will. He is broken down at the beginning through torture. He has a leg and an arm cut off. He is left to die as nothing, yet he fights on to survive. Kamata, a scientist, finds him struggling for his life failing to go up some steps in an alley carrying around his dead arm and leg and decides to Texhnolyze him. It is a form of biologic evolution where one can be given bionic limbs through alterations to the brain, making it compatible with the Texhnolyzed body parts. Ichise initially rejects the help he is given. Whether it be his pride, a need for independence, a general mistrust of Kamata, or a rejection of Texhnolyzation, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's a combination of the above. Each reason on its own yields a good psychological, philosophical, or sociological discussion, but we're trying to keep the review shorter than the anime. Anyways, he is outraged from the previously mentioned torture and the new limbs that were forced onto him. He storms off and finds himself in the exact same alley in which he was picked up from. He goes back in order to go up those steps himself in order to prove that he can fend for himself.  
Knowing that much about Ichise should tell you plenty about his character that we can blaze through plot points in order to start talking about the main themes of the anime. He meets Ran, which is a prophet. She literally sees the future. He then, through the help of multiple characters, as well as of his own will, becomes accustomed to being alive and civilized. He learns to value people and relationships. He becomes grateful of the people around him. As soon as this actualization is complete, Ran tells him that he will destroy everything and end up all alone. Which is in the complete opposite direction from where he is heading as a character. He is flabbergasted by this prediction, claiming that he would never do something like that. At this point, we, the audience, believe him. We have grown and learned values with him and can no longer see him reverting back to his violent, primitive self. You see progress in him as a character, and in him as a representation of yourself and humankind in general. Just as you have develop a hope in him, you develop a hope in humanity.  
Without getting into too much plot, because it is extremely complex, let's just say we find out a little after, that the humanity that has been living above them, has given up. The humanity that sent them underground, that everyone had been aspiring to and believed was better, had decided to sit and wait for extinction. If we had time, I would've loved to talk about Yoshii, someone that came from above ground and started causing pure chaos just for the sake of chaos. He claimed conflicts and struggles were human. If only I was writing a book and not a review. Anyways, after finding out that humanity up above had given up, he returns underground to seek comfort in his friends. When he comes back down, he witnesses his friends get murdered by the surviving common-folk. I didn't wanna get too much into the plot, but I should probably explain that the reason he went up above ground was to warn humanity that a guy underground had gone crazy and built an army of Texhnolyzed mech units and was planning on invading them. The reason I didn't want to talk about the plot is because that is all technically inaccurate. Again, I don't have enough time to discuss Kano, who believed he could evolve all of humanity by turning everyone into tree-like beings through the previously mentioned Texhnolyzed mech units. Anyways, when Ichise finally makes it back to Ran, who was his last friend, his last comfort, he finds out Kano already 'Texhnolyzed' her. Which, to Kano, means cutting off people's heads and attaching them to a basic life support bag looking thing. By this time, though, she had already died in some weird supernatural thing looking scene. Ichise kills Kano, and then kills Ran, or whatever is left of her. He lies down all alone, having destroyed everything and everyone around him, and waits to die.  
So, nihilism. Ichise did absolutely everything in his power to be a better person, to care for not only himself, not only his friends, but to care about humanity as a whole and its survival. Something that would not even be conceivable for the Ichise in episode 1. After all that growth and development, everyone around him does the opposite and gives up. He ends up all alone. Kamata gives up on science and evolution. Onishi (which I know I didn't mention because it would make the review significantly longer) gives up on his city. Ran gives up on the future. Kano gives up trying to save humanity. Humanity gives up on surviving. Shinji gives up on camaraderie. Haru gives up his ambition. Yoshii gives up on civilization. Hirota gives up on life. Kohakura gives up on loyalty. Sakimura gives up on Yoshii. Toyama gives up on fighting. So on and so forth. I know I don't talk about any of these characters, but it's important to show that Ichise witnesses everyone losing their values, yet he perseveres. His will allows him to persevere and keep hoping that not everything was for nothing. That there is something worth looking forward to in this world. Yet, the world fails him. Fate fails him. He was told how everything was going to end. He was told he would destroy everything and end up alone. He fought with the entirety of his will, and by extension, humanity's will and it was not enough. The world gave up on him.  
Well, there's that unorganized mess of a review/analysis or something like that. I just finished this anime for the first time. Next time I watch it, I'll fix this review.

    Texhnolyze is an incredibly bleak anime. It's dark, depressing, violent, and full of themes that many would rather not think about. With all of that said, the series works as a whole. It asks questions of life, immortality, and other philosophical topics.  
The story follows a young name, named Ichise, who lives in a world where people can get prosthetics, also known as Texhnolyze, for parts of the body that are broken, unusable, or weak. Ichise gets caught between a war with different factions who are out to get one another. Meanwhile, while this is going on, society as a whole seems to be on the brink of collapse, or perhaps extinction. On his journey, Ichise meets an array of characters, including a young girl named Ran. Ran has the ability to see one outcome, out of many, in the future. Honestly, the story, while interesting, is really a boat for the themes and metaphors that Texhnolyze wants to show to the viewer. It's a way for the production team, and writers, to give the viewer a ton of questions that they themselves have to think about and answer (if they wish). Also, I should note that the series is very slow. I know the idea of factions and violence sounds like something that would be full of non stop action, but it really isn't. If you are the type of person that can't stand scenes of people not talking for minutes upon minutes, this might not be for you. 
The animation here is not necessarily anything special, but it doesn't have to be. Most of the show is dark. It's a show covered in blacks and browns. Because of this, it doesn't need to took fantastic or brightly lit. The character designs are fitting and wonderfully animated. The character designer for Texhnolyze is Yoshitoshi ABe. I love his character designs. He knows how to make characters seem odd and distant from reality. In particular, his designs of young girls have always been masterful. Sure, like any guy, I enjoy occasionally seeing hot girls in anime with short skirts and tons of fanservice. But I also like the more ""out there"" type of female characters as well. Yoshitoshi knows how to do this well and continues his success here with Ran. 
Just like the animation, the sounds here aren't special but don't have to be. For the most part, the anime has two types of music used - slow guitar and ambient music. They work well in creating the universe that the characters live in. The OP is quite good too. It's very techno-ish and pumps the viewer up for what is to come. When it comes to the ED, at first, I wasn't a fan. I didn't hate it, per se, but didn't care for it ether. As time went on, though, I grew to like it a lot. At the very end of the series, a new song comes into play during the credits. It's quite nice and fits the ending of the anime perfectly.  
While there are a ton of characters scattered throughout the series, the main ones that I want to mention are Ichise and Ran. Ichise is a strong character who goes through a lot of suffering and trauma throughout the series. I was always rooting for him and wanting to see him succeed in every task he took on. I couldn't help but feel bad for him whenever negativity came his way. He's a different kind of hero than the ones that most of us are used to. He doesn't smile and looks more like a villain than a good guy, but that's kind of why I enjoy him so much in Texhnolyze. He's different. Ran is very fascinating as well. Since she has the ability to see one of many future outcomes, her worth to certain characters is enormous. I loved how mysterious she was in every single episode. Usually, I am more than interested in learning about characters and their backstories, but I didn't want or need to with Ran.  
Texhnolyze is one of the best anime I've ever seen. Its topics of life and death are beyond fascinating. I also greatly appreciated how it dealt with philosophical ideas. Texhnolyze asks a lot of questions to the viewer and doesn't give any answers afterwards. It's up to the viewer to answer those questions on their own.

    The story is a complex look at the harsh nature of reality where our hope for technological salvation isn't quite reachable. This series offers a glimpse into the very darkest aspects of the 'soul.' Humanity is on the brink of it's existence and the survivors are broken inside like shards of glass. The remaining humans electing to live in poverty in a struggle to hold onto any resemblance of a life, clinging to the scraps of civilization.  
The pacing of this series is tediously slow although the rewards for watching are numerous. There isn't much dialogue, electing to rely on symbolism, flashbacks and the ability of the viewer to put the pieces together. 
This series might not be appealing to newer fans of Anime but people willing to explore and search out the classics, revolutionary or simply older Anime; will enjoy this series. This is one series that shall stay with me, it's a truly unique series that deserves more love and respect. This series is truly an overlooked gem.

    This is easily the most heart-breaking anime I've ever seen. At the start, I was unsure whether it was worth continuing. The random sexual acts drove me mad, and a number of things led me to believe it would be the same plot I had seen and hated zillions of times. Rival gangs in a run-down city? An orphan who was clearly destined to become the classic tormented anti-hero with daddy issues? A mysterious tribe with a despondent clairvoyant? Yet another heavily symbolic world of synthetic technology? And that name! Shameful! How could this be good? To anyone who is thinking along those same lines, I highly recommend that you stick it out. Because this anime turned out to be anything but ordinary.  
The story and environment design were very well done, but the thing that resonated with me the most in this series were the characters. Even the characters I despised I could identify with and understand. There were few shallow fillers; each individual had their own interesting psychology. For example, Doc. Oh did I hate that woman with a burning passion. But, I could see exactly where she was coming from. She represents many women, I feel. Even though she is talented, successful, beautiful, and smug about it all, she is never really satisfied. She can't be. There exists a void within her, a starving desire for love and affection which she has never received and subtly tries to fill throughout the series. And I have to mention Ichise, my favorite. Ichise is a marvel to me because he is unlike any other main character or hero protagonist I've met. In the beginning he is a complete animal, which is a very rare state to be portrayed in. I was expecting for him to be reformed into the bad boy with a heart of gold, or maybe the kid with a hard-edged personality who doesn't always let people off easy, but does it for the greater good or out of disgust for the depraved. But Ichise is none of these. He cannot be called a hero in even the loosest sense of the term. He is merely a survivor who does wrong more often than right, and the good that he does is usually out of a sense of loyalty, duty, or yearning to belong. He isn't intended to be a role model. In this way he is just like most of humanity. But besides being just as awful as the rest of us, he maintains uniqueness. Talking isn't really his thing, he only does it when he has to. Even if a direct question is posed to him, he rarely answers it. He is passive, almost to the extent that you could consider him a doll at times, and yet he has free will. He is also extremely detached and hardly ever shows emotions. Few bonds are made with him throughout the series, despite the attempts by some, and he is  disinterested in any physical touch. And, happily for viewers, although his deceased parents do play a role in his psyche, they are rarely brought up and there are no ""please feel sorry for me, I had such a tragic past!"" moments. Also very refreshing is the fact that Ichise is not undefeatable. He is extremely determined to survive and a strong fighter, but able to be conquered. 
Whew, sorry about that long paragraph, but I was very much enthralled by the characters of this series. Moving on, the storyline also turned out to be quite lovely. Even though a few stereotypes remain in this series, for the most part it was surprisingly deep. Worlds and human minds are masterfully and chillingly depicted, and everything that occurs can be described as hauntingly sorrowful. The overall feeling of the series is very disconnected, and many of the interactions and emotions are inconspicuous. How characters really feel is often open to interpretation. Texhnolyze is one of the few series I have watched that I have not sat back and thought, ""hmm, I could have done so much with this to make it better"". I won't give anything about the plot away, but as I said in the very beginning this anime is heart-breaking. If you are looking for a feel-good show or just a happy ending.... it's not here, ha ha. It does not get light-hearted or even remotely satisfying at any point. While it is poignantly dark and beautiful, it is not for the faint of heart and will only become a favorite of viewers who enjoy very solemn shows. 
After re-watching this series over a few years, I have to mention that some of the plot points stick with me, particularly when it comes to human integration with technology. The author's interpretation is that the more ""engineered"" humans become, and the more their body parts become replaced with ""better"" cybernetic ones, the less human people become. I know we aren't in that stage of the future yet, but I think we will be someday, and I very much enjoyed the speculation on this topic. I'm fascinated by the idea that even something basic - like our organs - can carry pieces of our souls with them, and that if enough pieces of our body are replaced, we might cease to have souls.    
Some little things about this series that caught my attention: 
Music. The theme song!!!!! I Love it! It's a rare thing indeed when an anime has a mainly instrumental opening, especially one that fits so well. 
Lack of common symbolism. There is much symbolism in this series for sure, but you won't hear cicadas or go into any weird ""mind state"" episodes. 
No psychological oddities. This series is psychological in many ways; however, it is mostly out there in front of you, and with some thinking you can figure it out. You won't be tripping acid to understand what's going on. 
Rewatch value. This series would actually be great the second time around, and a second viewing would heighten understanding. I can say that with certainty after having re-watched it at least three times now. 
In closing, this is a beautifully done, character driven, well-written series, but it is definitely not for happy-go-lucky types of people.

    Emotions are basic functions human possess: Happiness, sadness, anger, anxiety/nervousness...isolation, boredom, fear, disgust, dreadfulness. Every emotions are unique to each individual. Human psychology is mostly intriguing when analyzed carefully. The case with Texhnolyze is that emotions gears towards logic, ideology, religion etc. Texhnolyze is an anime that defies every human emotions except the pessimistic aspect. Texhnolyze is an anime that is full of hopelessness and despicable agony. Before we start the review, keep in mind that Texhnolyze is NOT for everyone as the anime convey heavy mature themes your average anime watcher, mainly teenagers, may find unappealing...unless your taste revolves around edgy topics then surely this may be for you. 
Texhnolyze is a dystopian science fiction anime about the man-made city of Lux, where society has neglected itself from evolution and withdraw any means of self-preservation. Our main character, Ichise, is an orphan turned prized fighter, was left with a huge with a price of losing his arm and leg. A female doctor named Eriko Kamata, took interest in Ichise of being a test subject for texhnolyzation, a newly designed prosthetic limbs that enhances human performance. With texhnolyzation, he begins to work for Organo, a Japanese-like mafia or Yakuza led by Onishi. Their rivals, the Salvation Union, a group that despise texhnolyzation and a resistance group against the Organo. Another resistance group or a band of young juvenile delinquents with texhnolyzation, the Racan, are a group that has no purpose in battling for ideology but only for personal gains. Three opposing factions are set in a brutal civil war of who, as the nature's best survivor, would take control of Lux. One particular character, Ran, a mysterious young prophet who has the ability to foresee Lux and also Ichise's demise. Our cycle of despair begins there 
The thing about Texhnolyze is that the atmosphere is gravely dim, void of life and self-perseverance. The world of Lux is nothing but a false utopia, a wasteland. Texhnolyze isn't an anime that forces you to like it but how it welcomes you to the pessimistic world and kindly request you to like Texhnolyze. It is odd, yes but Texhnolyze does have an identity of immersing you to a terrifying experience. It's difficult to get into Texhnolyze due to its very slow-pacing, which can easily drive the viewers bored to tears. While that may be the recurring issue the anime has, it takes itself seriously with heavy exposition and a realistic tone. At times, there are filler throughout the show which can be very tedious as you progress. However, the strongest point comes from the characterization and dialogue. 
Texhnolyze is punishing, brutal, pessimistic but oddly enough, you'll grow to like it and engaged by its gripping tale of despair and hopelessness. The anime perfectly embodies visceral nihilism, withdraw from societal norms, and fear of evolution. For a pessimistic show, the ending did come off as anti-climatic as ever, even predictable, nothing as mind-blowing the ending can be but the ending ironically fits so perfectly for this pessimistic show. The grim reality of humans struggling to survive as it comes to a realization that we are fully mindless mammals as we unleashed our inner urge to inflict pain and despair as the anime portrays every single human that are destructive to one another. As such, this is true hell

    “Only one glass of water brightens the world” – Voice on Radio 
There are times, sadly rare, when an anime will transcend the medium. Leaving behind the plucky, odd coloured hair hero or the somber anti-hero, these series inevitably leave their mark on anyone who watches them. They might be good, bad or somewhere in between; in the end it is irrelevant. They are different, they are weird and they are impossible to look away from. 
Texhnolyze is one such series. 
It begins with an episode oozing with symbolism. Blink and you’re apt to miss something, some crucial piece of a puzzle you’re never given all the pieces to anyway. It’s an episode that, or so I’ve heard, was specifically designed to drive casual viewers away and in that it succeeds. It almost turned me away, if I’m being honest. Dialogue is at a premium, whoever wrote the script hoarding words like they were priceless jewels. Without this crucial aspect of human interaction you’re forced to watch and judge for yourself; why are they doing these things? What is s/he thinking? What, exactly, is going on? 
I have yet to see anything like it. But I’ll freely admit it isn’t for everyone. As I said, it nearly turned me off and so I can certainly understand why some might abandon this series. But if you can push through an odd first episode and a slow start, you’ll find something unique. 
The story is set in Lux, a city caught in a tense stalemate between gangs. There’s vague references to the “Class”, a group of elite people living on a nearby hilltop. Mechanical limbs, the process of grafting them to a body dubbed texhnolyzation, are also present and quite widespread through society. Unfortunately, that is about all you get in regards to the world. 
As I alluded to above, everything in this anime depends on your own interpretation. Nothing is spoonfed to the audience and while it works well with the characters, it fell flat when it came to the general world. Even after finishing it I have no real idea what Lux is, or who the Class are. It ultimately makes the anime purely character driven, which isn’t a bad thing, but a solid explanation by the end of the series would have been nice. 
Speaking of the characters, they really do drive the story. Ichise’s search for meaning to his life is an interesting one, as is watching Oonishi fight for what he believes is the right thing to do. Others, such as Ran and the Doc, help to round out the cast and provide their own unique look at different topics. Change in them is subtle and slow, just like real people, and while I couldn’t predict their actions (or maybe more correctly they didn’t fit into roles I’d come to expect) they never felt like they betrayed who they were. Even if I didn’t agree with or understand their actions entirely, they never felt wrong. That was something Ichise would do, or that is something Ran would say. 
The actual story itself shares this unpredictability, more so than the characters. I had no idea where it was headed for most of the series, and I mean that in a good way. It kept me wanting to watch, wanting to see what happened next. There aren’t many anime that pull this off and it felt…refreshing. 
Moving on to the technical aspects, the sound is great. Whether it’s the opening song, a new personal favourite, or the strangely alien sounds of the texhnolyze vision (you’ll understand what I mean when you watch), it all just fits. Nothing seems out of place and it’s all good quality. 
The art style is a little different, however, and might take some getting used to. It feels…old, I suppose? I’m not quite sure how to describe it. Sort of similar to how shows like Bebop and Outlaw Star were drawn way back when, but with a facelift and some more modern design choices, like less harsh edges. It might take getting used to by some, but it’s not all that bad and suits the kind of depressing tone the show seems to go for. 
In the end, I’d recommend this for anyone looking for something different. If you’re not into that sort of thing, however, I’d give it a miss.

    The quintessential series that is ""not for everyone"". A show which its enjoyment heavily depends on the observer, but I would like to dispel that notion.  
Texhnolyze is certainly a difficult anime, as you see it the story becomes more serious and it becomes clear with every passing episode that the conclusion won't be a happy resolution. And yet that is the hold point of the journey, here you have a show concerning the transformation of the human essence once the pick of the race has long past. The cast are here to represent different aspects of our species and in their different arches will see how something new will be born.  
Now that right there is where most people that i know say lies the reason why this show cannot be for all audiences, and here I disagree. First let me say that the only prerequisite is that you have more than 21, if so even if you do not like this genre you have to watch this anime. This is mainly because the scope a spread of the ideas presented are enough to justify at least one complete view of the episodes once in a life time. 
The subjects tackled will expand greatly any set of values and at least force some revising of one's beliefs, and such a confrontations with once self will open new forms of thought. 
So to end, watch it at least once regardless of personal preferences.

    This review contains spoilers. 
Texhnolyze's protagonist, Ichise, personifies the human condition, as he is persistent in his struggle to survive despite inhabiting a crumbled society, becoming a symbol of hope is seldom found. Never does Ichise allow his surroundings to interrupt what his goal or task is at any given instance throughout the series' run, and, while most of his time is spent being a tool for technological advancement, or a developing weapon to protect his masters, his resilience is always present, and lack of independence is, ironically enough, itself an act of independence. This is because this is all Ichise knows. Since his parents' death, his existence requires instruction, and without it, his is nothing more than an enraged, primal beast, and as his character develops, this requirement gradually disappears, as does his instinctive rage. His construction as a human being feels organic, as there are moments in which Ichise emotionally reverts, seemingly submitting to the overwhelming events unfolding before him. Through this, it is important to understand that, Ichise, as a personification of the human condition, demonstrates emotional fragility, which consistently makes his personal development difficult. This gives him something internal to overcome as well as external, making the finished product more rewarding. By the show's end, Ichise is the sole survivor, content with the fact that death is inevitable; a testament to his newfound maturity. Having witnessed and being responsible for countless deaths and destruction, all that is left is a man satisfied with fulfilling his purpose with nothing left to give. Anybody reading this could reasonably find something within you that can be find within Ichise, Lord knows my emotional fragility is nothing short of intense. He is humanity; an allegory of self-improvement, self-reflection; hope, survival. 
Ichise comes into contact with an array of significant characters, but none more compelling than Eriko, colloquially referred to as ""Doc"". While Texhnolyze's characters effectively construct Ichise into the character he eventually becomes, Eriko is a character constructed by her interactions with Ichise, and the prime example of this opposite dynamic existing. Her sole motivation was technological innovation, which gradually becomes secondary upon discovering the perfect lab rat, Ichise. Through her infatuation with Ichise, her goal is set to be realized, and her faith in humanity to strive further as a species can be justified. As the show progresses, she detects Ichise's rejection of the platonic, almost parental relationship she created, which, as a result of this suspicion being accurate, prepares her for isolation from the world entirely, returning to the surface alongside Ichise, before she eventually kills herself, in a reveal that is superbly illustrated, maintaining thematic and tonal consistency, with enough subtlety to infer what is being presented, as well as being agonizing to witness upon realization, creating the show's most powerful death scenes, in a show that is emblematic of death itself. Her initial image as a saviour and a solution to humanity's prosperity is, in and of itself, rejected, and her character arc is a reflection of the species' futility and powerlessness, as she allows her emotions to get the best of her; character traits starkly similar to her beloved guinea pig. 
In Texhnolyze's first half, there are three ideologically opposed factions. Firstly, Organo predominantly holds power over citizens of Lux, boasting strong organizational prowess and resources by way of technological advancement. This, however, is viewed as a commodity, and through their power came the segregation of classes. The subset of individuals who have lost all hope are unable to access the impressive technology Organo possesses, and are actively neglected by the above class. Organo is materialistic and self-serving. Their arrogance is highlighted in the scene where Ichise, post-texhnolyzation, is disgusted and enraged by his modified body, interrupting a conversation involving Eriko. Eriko sees Ichise's behaviour as ungrateful, as if he owes her and, by extension, Organo, for all that they've done for him, placing themselves on a holier-than-thou pedestal, which is also a solid example of Eriko's saviour-complex being displayed. To acquire their services requires total submission, and that is Ichise's relationship with Organo. Of course, within Organo as a collective, lies characters with ideological agency themselves, Eriko already serving as an example. Her position in Organo is merely advantageous to her actual goal. To give another example, there's Organo's leader, Onishi, who displays immeasurable conviction to his principles throughout the show, leading to internal conflicts within the organization. He is calm and collected to a fault; almost benevolent, if not for his passive leadership and naive perspective on the society he leads. His organizational behaviour is his undoing, and often do we see him struggle to maintain control amidst the chaos, forcing him to wholly reshape himself. To understand Onishi's decisions as a leader, it's important to remember a key phrase repeatedly used to justify said decisions; to paraphrase, ""the city doesn't wish to see a spectacle"". This appeal to decorum and peace indicates that, for all the power and influence that Onishi has at his disposal, the inevitability of conflict is inescapable, forming the basis for his character progression. Referring back to my initial point, the second of the three factions are Organo's opposition, the Salvation Union, who sought to interfere with Organo's work, as they wish to rid the City of Lux of texhnolyzation, so as to not sully their flesh. Obviously most resembling a religious cult, the Union, through sheer charisma and dogma, have the ability to indoctrinate individuals who have nothing left to lose, or had nothing to fight for in the first place, into following their cause. Unlike Onishi, who prefers to dismiss security accompaniment, Kimata, the Union's leader, has no problem allowing his followers to guard and protect him. He views his underlings as disposable, whereas Onishi does not, and under the guise of salvation, Kimata seeks to gain power through manipulating those beneath him, which is a striking reflection of the reality of cults and their larger than life leaders. Thirdly, Lakan is an organization of texhnolyzed individuals who desire nothing more than the freedom from the turmoil surrounding Lux, and the freedom to do as they wish. Lakan, despite their rejection of a system designed to oppress, ultimately falls victim to complacency. Much like the Union, their advocacy invites and attracts individuals who have nothing to fight for and want purpose, however, one crucial difference is that the Union's followers had long forfeited their agency, meaning their capacity to abandon the cause is impossible, whereas Lakan's members, as implied by Yoshii, will, for lack of a better description, run away when shit hits the fan. Yoshii is a man who derives fascination from human behaviour, believing Lux to be an embodiment of this component. He almost serves as the viewer's avatar by virtue of being an outsider, though his actions throughout the show, a small example being when he killed two people as a method of liberation from their personal hopelessness and entrapment, make him so much more than that. Yoshii's philosophy essentially boils down to ""to embrace death is to abandon suffering"", which is a notion that is prevalent thematically long after his death, meaning he remains an integral attribute and is not forgotten after his exclusion from the show. His actions shift the paradigm; he essentially wants to watch the world burn, or, more specifically, wishes to analyse the primitive nature of humanity by testing their fortitude to adapt. 
Compared to what has occurred so far, the latter half of Texhnolyze is more abstract with its thematic presentation, shifting focus away from gang warfare in favour of the fight against a greater enemy, raising the stakes exponentially. Surrounding this, a couple of existing minor characters are developed and/or are thematically relevant. For example, Toyama, an Organo member, who is initially tasked to show Ichise the ropes upon his recruitment, is an intriguing character in his own right. Throughout his time with Ichise, he reflects on why he chose texhnolyzation; to erase any trace of relation to his father, who is presented in the show as despicable and perverse. This parallels Ichise's hatred of his father before discovering he was framed, forming somewhat of a rivalry, making Toyama the yin to Ichise's yang. While it's clear their angst is based on similar circumstances, Toyama is fundamentally different as a person. Ichise himself is very forthcoming and motivated, despite his motivation effectively deriving from angrily punching people and seeking instructional purpose, whereas Toyama is willingly subservient and unsure of himself. All Ichise knows is subservience, while Toyama is aware of his subservience and does nothing about it; he is accepting of it. His development is driven by inferiority, which culminates in his eventual defeat after choosing to fight Ichise one on one, which Toyama specifically desired by killing the grunts invading the surface alongside him. As a character with an inferiority complex, Toyama is superb and underrated. 
Another underrated supporting character is Kohakura, a member of the Organo's council, with significant influence within the organization. Lux's inhabitants are no strangers to seeking personal gain, but I believe Kohakura best represents the concept through his actions and ideals. He is initially responsible for the loss of Ichise's limbs, which already presents him as cold and ruthless, given how this event was also an independent decision rather than an order. He picks his spots with calculation, unlike his fellow council members, who shared a similar dissatisfaction with Onishi's leadership during the show's first half. A natural opportunist, Kohakura decides to become a Shape, the next step in evolution and advancement, as we see his head on, what appears to be an operating table, connected to a mechanical torso. It is a horrifying visual that elicits curiosity and fear, as well as an insightful view into the nature of separating one's physical humanity. Even after the technology's defection, Kohakura considers his evolutionary ascension as fortunate, his only regret being unable to make Onishi see and follow the path he did. Ultimately, as a man who understands the moral bankruptcy of the society he inhabits, he finds solace in the fact that such an unfortunate outcome was always likely in a world where misfortune is commonplace. 
A prevalent theme, which most closely relates to the neighbouring village of Gabe, is determinism vs. fate. Gabe's governance is influenced by a ""seer"", an individual who possesses the ability to see visions of one possible near-future out of many. In Gabe, the seer's visions are infallible, making them followers and purveyors of fate. Their actions have little to no impact on the happenings within Lux, mainly because their way of life permits them to back off. The impending destruction of humanity is essentially common knowledge to Gabe meaning that, through their complacency, they have already accepted death, while their determinist neighbours are attempting to fight it. They are basically Texhnolyze's interpretation of doomers. To detail, the seer is a young girl named Ran, who, contrary to her followers, is extremely crucial to the events of Texhnolyze. Ran often rejects her responsibility of seer, and her lack of maturity and a combination of other things, such as her desire to protect Ichise, prevents her from accepting her visions, shown to be in a state of panic in one instance. Her presence is omniscent; her existence fuels humanity and its sanity, which is an incredible burden to carry, and it shows. The connection between her and, for example, Ichise, is formed via desperation; the acknowledgement of potential in Ichise as a ray of hope among the hopeless, as evidenced by her visible disappointment whenever Ichise falls back into old habits, as well as her ominous prophecy of ""you will hurt many people"", which I believe to be a way to direct Ichise into doing the opposite. Ran, as a character, is a terrific and tragic example of unfathomable power being forced upon a host who can't possibly control it, which, by extension, forces them to either find an unlikely escape or accept the consequences through no fault of their own. 
If I may be blunt, Lux is a shithole. The world of Texhnolyze is defined by its barren atmosphere, which perfectly coincides with the show's world building. The towering architecture reinforces the City's oppressive aura, and, like its citizens, Lux distinctly lacks colour and vigor; blacks, greys, and browns engulf the landscape, alongside a harsh, synthetic sky that blasts down to truly emphasize the city's internal darkness. Ironically, the lifeless nature of Lux is what gives it character; the destruction and constant turmoil breathes life into the city, unlike society on the surface, which is a peaceful haven, but robotic in nature. Citizens mechanically follow almost programmed motions ignorant of the fact that death has already taken them. The aesthetic irony and contrast between Lux and the surface is staggeringly apparent, with the latter being a heavenly and prosperous paradise upon first glance, until the facade of beauty becomes clear. In the same way an abandoned ghost town is haunting, the surface generates the same feelings, and it is presented with a deft understanding of what can potentially make a setting scary; repetitive and ambiguous radio transmissions, citizens being translucent figures absent of natural human behaviour, even something as simple as an empty movie theatre, they serve to provide a chilling atmosphere, greatly enhancing the fear factor. It is known that the show as a whole highlights the acceptance of death through the nihilistic realization that life is meaningless, so I don't believe that the theme's presence is unique to the surface. Instead, using that as a basis to suggest that death acceptance is what the surface primarily represents, secondarily, the surface is representative of the monotony, misery, and tedium of peace. Before I explain, it's important to note that I define peace in the context of Texhnolyze as the omission of conflict, regardless of its severity. Citizens of the surface are husks, either ignorant of the near-death, or are awaiting death, nostalgic of their past, now trapped within an infinite state of nothingness. It is through conflict that humanity is able to function, or, at the very least, it is a dominant component to its functionality. Something like simple disagreements constitute as conflict and without something as innate to social engagement as this, you get the surface's citizens, who may as well be drones. This idea is best evidenced in scenes featuring former citizen of the surface turned train engineer in Lux, Sakimura, who, upon returning, accompanying Ichise and Eriko, is met with the same unnatural, unchanging, and uniform behaviour from his old work peers and boss. Sakimura raises concerns about an invasion to his old boss, to which the response given to him is that of complacency, which is a charitable interpretation if you ask me. The response is not so much complacency as it is just a predetermined, programmed interaction prompt. This best demonstrates the robotic nature of the surface, as well as the exclusion of conflict through the fact that citizens are seemingly programmed with piece in mind at all times with no consideration of any deviation.

    A masterpiece that made me feel joyful and devastated simultaneously, especially at the end. Never have I seen anything end this way. Stunning...and by that I mean, literally stunned.  
No, it's not an anime for everyone, thank God; if it were it wouldn't be itself. Texhnolyze is devastating, hardening, gruesomely realistic, gritty (including the animation). It surpasses thought provoking and reaches thought-torturing. It is absolutely beautiful.  
The episodes are slow. Hell, the first episode in and I was already looking for reviews that dissed it, and believe me, they exist. There are plenty of pretty well written posts on why Texhnolyze is pointless and boring. Most of them say it's painful to watch, stupid, needlessly dystopian. And yeah, I can see where people would see it that way.  
I had my doubts while watching the series as well. One episode would be great, one would be dry and I'd pause it a million times to look up more interesting facts, like who the voice actors were (most of whom apparently only participated in a handful of other animes, and some who only worked on Texh). But in the end, it pulls through.  
It's not that it ends very differently than you may suspect; that might be why it is so powerful (at least to me). Texhnolyze doesn't focus on surprises or exciting plot twists because people are surprising and twisted enough on their own.  
Absolutely sickening and gorgeously raw, so beautiful and so ugly and so, so human. Not for the faint of heart, but if you have one, you might just love it.

    Texhnolyze is a mature series - it isn't mature down to: 
- sexual content 
- swearing 
- masses of gore 
- taboo subjects 
Instead, it's mature simply down to the high psycological element that requires the audience to commit full attention to every factor of what's on screen. 
This is very diffeent series - an odd, cyberpunk, apocolyptic style, partial conspiracy that still confuses me a tad. 
Story... 
This series really is a great example of a psycological mind mess. It leaves a great deal up for discussion an it offers little information. 
The story pretty much starts at episode one; backstories aren't too importiant and events that occur during the run of the series are the only ones that require explainations.  
The tone is eerie and the pace is very slow - delibrately, just to ensure the audience gets a full insight into just how bad a situation is, in favour of simply skimming over the uncomfortable and featuring a character re-adapt in no time - these characters are a gloomy as it gets, the detail to their desperate prediciments makes can easily lead a viewer to yearn for answers just as much as the character in question. 
Story comes before character type within this anime and as stated, the delivery is purposley slow, so this isn't for everyone, some viewers should avoid, some may have to put effort into pushing threw a few early ep's (it picks up as time goes by), whilst others may simply accept and enjoy the pace (it is something rare afterall). 
Characters... 
This series features loners; the deeply depressed, the disturbed, mystery workers and mystery travelers - some suffer in silence whilst others are calmly sadistic - basicaly, nobody is extrovert; characters in general don't feel the need to fill a slience, yet they get their points across. 
It becomes clear that the characters are all fairly complex, possibly the headlining male lead in particular, who appears to be an anti-social loner who you could easily assume to be a selective mute - he's set in his ways, yet he undergo's a journey - his journey in particular is one you must really follow carefull, as; he hardley speaks, he has no friends or family speaking for him,  no narration on his thoughs and past and no clear enemy. 
Art... 
The scenery in general is eveerything, as in this series, actions speak louder then words (litterally;the characters hardly speak, easy job for the voice actors?) - the scenery is pretty, quite realistic looking and constantly changes - the colour tone witin the series fits in with the mood - anything from dull to misty; generally eerie.  
The characters are well illustrated; reaslistic looking in comparrassion to most  modern animes, where the characters are very 'cute' and animated looking - this looks a little like some of the animes popular in the 90s.  
Overall... 
It seems as though this isn't really one of those things you're suppose to sit and 'enjoy' as such (i.e. not entent to get the audience too excited); you're suppose to simply take in what you see and watch what unfolds - it's not loaded with action scenes or clear info'; it's one of those each individual watching may percive differently. 
Enjoyment... 
Brilliant, well though out, mature material - much reccomended! 
Very different; not normally my thing - being into; high energy, fast pace,  action tales with quirky characters - this is the polar oposite; a purposely slow pace, moody and suprisingly realistic story I'm not even sure you're suppose to enjoy.

    A psychological story about a futuristic dystopia could very easily go very wrong in the hands of the wrong people; Luckily, the people previously known for Serial Experiments Lain, Haibane Renmei, and a small wealth of other fine titles were at the controls of Texhnolyze. On that note, Texhnolyze bore fewer similarities to Lain than it did to Ergo Proxy; So, needless to say, if you have seen and enjoyed Proxy then this is definitely a show to watch (and vice-versa). 
Story; 10. This is hands down why Texhnolyze is as good as it is. There were, sadly, a number of fairly aggravating faults in other aspects of the series, however the plotline was essentially flawless. Slow, realistic pacing is key here, so anyone who doesn't like any down time between plot points should probably steer clear of this from the start. However, once it gets going this show was actually very well paced. The last ten or so episodes were filled with intricate explanations, epic monologues, and genuinely unexpected twist; if Evangelion had a properly executed ending, it would have matched this one. The other noteworthy fact of Texhnolyze's story is the atmosphere it creates. The show from start to finish successfully carried a melancholy tone of poverty, deprivation, and various other elements that helped create a truly upsetting world. Episode 19 is probably the high point of this, which I can't actually explain. It's probably the only thing I've ever seen that made me want to cry, but not for any specific reason, it's just really heavy stuff. Very successful story. 
Art; 8; This should pretty much come down to wether or not your a fan of Abe's style. If you are, it looks good, and if not, you're not going to like the way this looks any more than anything else he's ever done. And personally, I like it. A welcome change from all the doe eyed moe girls we're used to. 
Sound; 8. The soundtrack served the dreary atmosphere well, there was not a pop hit in sight. Mostly low-fi electronic and strings, and being a fan of Juno Reactor already made it a cool treat to hear the opening, Guardian Angel. 
Character; 7. Here's the issue I had here. Ichise was not developed really at all until around episode eight or nine; And right from the get go, I could tell I was supposed to feel bad for him. But, he wasn't developed at ALL, so I didn't. I can appreciate the idea of keeping a shroud of mystery over such characters in this kind of story, but even a small backstory segment would have helped me out a lot. Ran was done perfectly, however, and I thoroughly enjoyed her character. Actually, every side character was by stories end fleshed out incredibly well except Ichise, although they did admittedly pick up the ball towards mid series. The doc also grew on me a lot towards the end. It's a shame they messed him up so bad, because aside of that glaring issue it's a great show. 
Enjoyment/Overall; 8. I welcome this series greatly because until now, nothing had even touched the head scratching, soul searching inexplicable ""heaviness"" of Ergo Proxy for me. Likewise, nothing had captured that dystopian, edge of complete destruction world, and on both accounts Texhnolyze delivered. This show deserves much more attention, because as a sum of all it's parts, it's a very successful series.

    Rarely do you come across masterpieces like this. It's been some time since I watched Texhnolyze for the first time, but I just got to writing a review. 
As most people know the series is a bit difficult to watch, though that didn't stop me from marathoning it one afternoon. The atmosphere is very dense, the story morbid, and the characters brooding; it's not an anime for everyone. Yet, anyone with some knowledge about anime will know why this series is a masterpiece regardless of whenether they enjoyed watching it or not. 
Now to write a non-spoiler fast summary, let's say this is difficult as it's extremely easy to reveal something subtle so easily and ruin the enjoyment of somebody. Just read the MAL description, there's nothing much for me to say here. 
Some might say Texhnolyze is an anime trying too hard to be dark and ends up much too shallow for such an atmosphere. The creators of this masterpiece did not intend to convey a deeper message, and that is something many might overlook. This is similar to the anime Ergo Proxy, albeit there the authors did indeed try to forward a ""deep"" message and in my opinion, failed horribly while creating a mediocre show. Texhnolyze was simply made to be a form of ""simple"" enjoyment and excels at this. All the feelings are there, the animation is top notch, and the soundtrack is extremely fitting. 
While some of the characters might come across as shallow, each and every one of them are fun to watch on the screen. From the enigmatic Joshi to the commanding Oniishi, each of the people in Texhnolyze has a unique personality and contributes to the storyline; there are no filler characters.  
The actual plot is a hit or miss. For me, it's a well-written story that might attract the occasional meaning-finder, but like I wrote before; it's just made to be enjoyed. 
Overall Texhnolyze is one of the best anime ever created, up there with the similar Serial Experiments Lain. I urge any and everyone to try it out and at least watch the first few episodes as the plot starts to pick up and the pieces fill the puzzle.

    My wife and I both strongly disliked, and were bored to tears by, Serial Experiments Lain so we were both quite hesitant going into Texhnolyze, as it's from the same character designer, Yoshitoshi ABe. Nonetheless, we are both big on giving things an honest chance and having an open mind so we gave it a watch. Neither of us enjoyed this anime, and here's why- 
Art- 
The art style and the way the anime is directed is remarkably similar to Serial Experiments Lain, which to us is a negative thing. This anime is now 15+ years old, so it's not fair to compare it graphically to something more modern, but this anime did not age well graphically. It's not particularly pretty, it looks clearly dated and some of the character models are pretty rough. Also, a key character in this anime looks far too similar to Lain herself, which we thought was weird and lame. 
The sound as a whole was also mediocre at best. The voice acting is extremely average at best and has absolutely zero standout performances. 
The music was well below average. I hardly noticed it throughout and there are no songs whatsoever that remotely stand out to me or that stick in my memory just days after completing this anime, nevermind weeks or months down the road. 
Character/Story- 
As usual from Yoshitoshi ABe, many of the characters in this anime are super cliche and stereotyped, one dimensional and in many cases simply very weird. I'm convinced this man has never interacted with a woman in his entire life because almost every female character in every anime I've seen from this man is about as stereotypical, cliche, cookie-cutter, one dimensional and unrealistic as they come. 
The ""main character"" in this anime, and I use quotes because it strongly felt to me like Onishi was the real main character, is one of the worst leads I've ever seen. He hardly talks or has any personality whatsoever, he has a poorly animated fat face and basically the only thing he does throughout the show- and he does this over and over again- is get angry and start hitting things. He's got a much less cool ""Hulk mad! Hulk SMASH!"" thing going on. 
The story overall didn't do it for us either. Any negative adjective you can apply to the story of Serial Experiments Lain is applicable here as well. Gruelingly slow? Absolutely. Convoluted? Yes. Hard to follow? Definitely. Super weird? Often. Outright boring? For sure. The pace as a whole is just punishingly slow and the overall story could have been told in 15 ish episodes, tops, but it drags for a very long and drawn out 22.  
To say one positive thing, the latter part of the show was better than the former and it had a few cliffhangers and a building mystery I was somewhat intrigued by, but it took wayyyyy too long to get there and the characters were so underdeveloped and lame that I simply didn't care about any of them by the time we hit that point. It was very much too little too late. 
Enjoyment- 
For both my wife and myself watching this just felt like a huge slog damn near from start to finish and we only opted to finish it at all because we absolutely hate dropping things and we see things through to the end for better or worse. We both fell asleep during this anime on more than one occasion and watching it just felt super tedious. The ending of the show was decent but by that point we were completely uninvested and just praying for it to be over as soon as possible. Neither of us enjoyed watching this at all. It wasn't our single least favorite anime of all time, but it's definitely very low on our list and not something either of us ever want to watch again. 
Overall- 
If you read this review up to this point you know my overall experience with this anime was largely negative. Just like Serial Experiments Lain it was very very slow, weird and convoluted and worst of all simply outright boring. It's big on symbolism and non-verbal story telling and if you liked Lain there is a good chance you'll like this. I strongly disliked Lain and this anime is very similar to it, so, thumbs down and definitely not recommended as far as I'm concerned... 
+Story concept is original and not something you've seen a dozen times before 
-GRUELINGLY slow 
-BORING 
-Very underdeveloped, cookie cutter, one dimensional characters 
-Graphically dated/hasn't aged well 
OBJECTIVE RATING- 4 
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 4

     I can honestly say, I cried at the end. A wretching, sniffling, snorting, tear-filled cry. 
There isn't much dialogue in it unlike quite a few anime, but it added to how beautiful it was. When there's no dialogue, you have to watch to make sure you know exactly what's going on. Usually, the music and the visual will communicate what's happening or what is about to happen. 
The soundtrack to this was outstanding! I downloaded the OST and I listen to it as often as I listen to my other favourite OST. They mixed Jazz, piano (some classical), electronic, one magnificent Dub song, and guitar (acoustic, classical). The sound wasn't particularly dark, but it wasn't too up beat either. 
What I loved; while I was watching it, everything Ichise was going through, I FELT. I got attached to him and he sucked me in further into the story and his pain and even his apathetic stares. 
If you've watched Ergo Proxy, you'll recognize these voices from the show: Onishi is by Patrick Seitz (who played Raul Creed in Ergo Proxy) and Toyama is by Liam O'Brien. 
KEEP IN MIND: This is not an anime for everyone. This anime takes a while to speed up and get to more dialogue. It's very bloody, gory, and has quite a few sexual scenes (including homosexuality). 
Overall, it's an outstanding anime.

    So one day I get a call from a friend of mine, lordzeru, and he tells me about this trippy first episode of this anime called Texhnolyze. I asked what makes it trippy. He says no one says a word, its very quiet. Usually in an anime trippy and unusual are a good thing and ultimately lead to  good mind fuck. This is not the case with Texhnolyze. 
From the get go there is like no audio. There is no music except the shitty opening, and I don't even think any words were said the first episode. The whole series keeps about the same pace. That is why the sound has a 1, there is no sound. No music, and little talking, especially from the main character, Ichise, who we nicknamed, ""Fists"" because he threw more punches than he spoke words. If I were to compare Fists character to anything it'd be a stray dog with the brain of a pile of rocks and the emotions of a tree stump. 
The setting of this story is some underground city called Lux which is controlled by several gangs fighting for power until some guy named Yoshi, who we nicknamed, ""Mustache"", comes in from the surface and just , fucks shit up. Mustache is the only characters I actually took a liking to simply because he pulled this series along and made shit happen. Meanwhile Fists ends up getting am arm and leg cut off by one of the gangs known as, ""Organo"". Fists is then taken in by horny female doctor called.....Doc, can't get anymore original than that. Anyways, Doc sets him up with some new prosthetic limbs, or Texhnolyzed limbs, as they call them. Fists then being the dumb stray dog he is then runs away from Doc and spends the rest of the series wandering around punching people. All except the little red-haired girl in a mask named Ran who follows him around and talks as little as he does. 
In the end, this series left me with a pure sense of emptiness, and by that I mean a complete void of emotion, something I'd never felt before, and that's the only reason I don't consider this anime a complete waste of time.

    If there was one word to describe this anime, that word would be ""brutal"". From the very first scene to the last, Texhnolyze constantly punishes it's characters and the world that it has created. This may make it sound like an unnecessarily harsh anime, it's quite the opposite. Texhnolyze is about the protagonist's growth and search for happiness in the darkest times. 
Texhnolyze is set in a believable future where the world has been corrupted by a convoluted political system where the privileged have replaced limbs with prosthetics that can surpass regular human function. This sounds like the usual cyberpunk anime and while it does carry similarities with Ergo Proxy (Ergo Proxy was released a few years later), this is a very unique take on how humankind attempts to continue as a species. 
The pacing for Texhnolyze begins incredibly slowly with the first episode having almost no dialogue at all. However don't let that dissuade you. Texhnolyze has an ability to tell it's story without being pretentious, nor does it insult your intelligence by making things obvious. The story builds each episode, adding layer upon layer until suddenly the anime is pure chaos. 
The art and sound for Texhnolyze is superb. Every song used throughout the series sets the tone of the scene, usually giving a feeling of dread, emptiness or suffering. In fact, I enjoy the soundtrack so much that I now own it. The art is also done well. Each character is unique, the action is animated well while not being over the top to detract from the main storyline and the different settings are easy to tell apart. The soundtrack and art style are used well together to emphasize the themes involved in every scene. 
The characters themselves are done well. Each character is important to the plot, explored in depth and memorable. There are no clear good guys or bad guys, instead Texhnolyze leaves the audience to try to make sense of the characters by themselves. The protagonist however can be a bit frustrating for some as he rarely ever speaks. Personally I did not have a problem with him though. 
Texhnolyze is one of my favourite animes. However it is not for everyone. The action is not spectacular, the characters are not straightforward and the themes of the show are mostly quite depressing. Instead of aiming to tell an entertaining story, Texhnolyze tries to be thought provoking, leaving the viewer to ask questions such as ""what makes living important?"" and ""can humans find happiness even if the future is bleak?"". For anyone who does enjoy something complex, thought provoking and is prepared to put their mind to work while watching an anime, then Texhnolyze is perfect for you. But if you are looking to relax, avoid this series.

    “Lack of originality, everywhere, all over the world, from time immemorial, has always been considered the foremost quality and the recommendation of the active, efficient and practical man.” 
The duality of the superficial world, free of conflict,  chaotic world of Lux, which devours itself with all the lingering ambitions, shows that the two humanitarian sides have been brought to their extreme and ultimately failed since the balance has broken. In other words, it symbolizes two different ways of confronting (or presenting) the extinction of the human race. 
Just waiting  for death with peaceful memories of the past, or by living and fighting to another yourself until you die at least as a result of your actions and not just wait for your eventual appearance. 
The other is interpreted more symbolically as a measure of the inner struggle of a person who lies in a coma with different personalities symbolizing the conflicting ideals or will within the mind. 
My first experience with ABe trilogy and that was very satisfactory. 
The series was shocking and unexpectedly bold, perhaps because of the ideas he discusses, namely stereotyping and oppression under the name of reform and refinement. 
Of the things that I liked very much which  matches the case of the city of Lux, which offers us the series systems of her life strange in the case of hell, which is essentially the embodiment of the torment of the human, for the inhabitants of the city of Lux is the most successful representation of the philosophy of nihilism most or all citizens of that city lost the identity and the will of life In waiting for a slow death, they live a life that neither nourish nor satisfy hunger , but is a formality routine waiting for the inevitable death.  
In my opinion, the series succeeds in creating and embodying a miniature model, a genius, a revolutionary of nihilistic ideas, an actual embodiment of hell and a loss of the identity of life. 
The whole series can show the conflict about how the mind must deal with those artificial, isolated state that finds itself in them. There is a religious aspect, the side of mind or order and disorder, which is symbolized by the three organizations in lux. 
. 
Plot (10/10) 
Ran's role is more ambiguous in my opinion, but I think one thing is certain and that is that she saw all this coming from the beginning ,That is why she was very depressed throughout the show  and refused to talk about her assumptions until the end , She wanted to be the only one who must suffer from that knowledge and not burden on others she is that she said to ichise that he would basically be the last one to die. 
In the end, ichise, the representation of will or basic humanity if you want to call it to reject the path of insanity or to fight madness through endless waiting in the form of those forms. 
Yoshii is one of the best villains as the motives and actions of the characters who presented the philosophy of nihilism in an ideal way , Yoshi's character was built in an excellent way , he was intrigued by humanity's emotions . 
And Youshii's motives were presented perfectly and his motives are because of the stereotype of life on the surface and its lack of life in the real sense and the people on the surface became ghosts moving and breathing without a goal. 
First: How does Yoshii see the world? 
-Yoshi does not see the bright world that some of us see. He sees another world full of evil, extremist and malicious tendencies hidden in the hearts of those who dare not express it for various reasons, such as the existence of a legal deterrent, nor does he see any benefit from life. The existence of man is worthless and devoid of any real meaning. 
Characters (9/10)  
Art has been used deeply that the world it represents is a strange world, not necessarily an indicator of the past or the future but has a close enough with our world that we can realize the importance of the story to it. 
The dark style of the animation inside the anime and the movement of camera and the world, which was exemplified in an excellent manner. All this was a great strong points of narration within this anime and the excellent soundtracks made this idealistic combination PERFECT. 
Animation & soundtrack (9/10)   
In conclusion.. 
The anime is dark and bloody, with a focus on music, inspiration and a lot of scenes. 
Revolves around a number of different personalities whose lives and destinies intersect in an atmosphere of guerrilla warfare, betrayal, power struggles and who will rule the lousy city of Lux until a common enemy comes to destroy everything. 
Personally I like the gangster style more than anything in my life 
This series presented everything I love and enjoy. 
The gangster style + Philosophical ideas + Blood & gore + Dark theme+ Excellent written characters + Story contains several aspects have been implemented in an excellent manner +  soundtrack I still listen to it so far  
what I can want more?  
 I consider Texhnolyze one of the best 3 animes  I've ever seen

    I have been watching Anime for many years and I can safely say that Texhnolyze is one of the most unique series that I have ever seen while simultaneously also being one of the most depressing shows I've ever seen. Texhnolyze is a dark show and while many other shows have been labeled dark I believe this show is one of the few that actually deserves this label. Texhnolyze is not just dark because of its story or plot elements like many other shows, Texhnoloyze is dark because it simply contains no light to the bleakness.  
The first part of this is the mood of the series. Other shows that are dark or depressing often have points that contain little bits of happiness, redemption, or at the veery least little dashes of humor here and there. Texhnoloyze contains no moments that can be described with the words stated above. While many can complain that this might make the show seem like one big depressing piece of filth I believe its darkness is one of its biggest strengths. The bleakness of it all almost makes the series beautiful in a twisted sort of way. It never compromises itself to appeal to a wider audience and if nothing else one can at least respect that the show was never dumbed down. The pacing in the show is slow and while this may be a complaint to some I feel it is completely necessary. Throughout this whole series there is this a looming sense of gloom and doom and that ""this is not going to end well"" and the slowness at which the plot progresses helps exemplify this. 
Now while I won't risk spoiling any of the plot I will describe the setting in which Texhnolyze takes place. The majority of the plot takes place in the underground city of Lux, which is actually brighter than some may imagine a underground city to look like. Now in this city it is very common for people to get robotic limbs and body parts to replace their old ones. Some use these for violence and love them while others, such as the main character, view them as almost a curse. Now the city of Lux is a home to a number of gangs that end up brutally fighting with each other over the course of the series. While Lux seems to be in order at the beginning of the series there is always a sense that the city is going to be destroyed soon weather it be by major characters or a more mysterious force. The city is very ugly ad not a place you would want to visit and it certainly is a horrid place to live.  
All the characters in the story  are flawed with many being self-destructive, it is not a very upbeat series as I have said before. Now why am I giving Texhnolyze a 10? Because it is beautiful,  despite the fact that I was never happy with the setting or characters in the show I was able to shed a tear when it ended and it was at that point thatI realized that the show had affected me.  Its definitely not a enjoyable piece of entertainment but as a piece of demented art about the dark side of humanity and the destructive nature of man it nears perfection. On the technical side animation, looks, and music fit together extremely well. Texhnolyze is certainly a series that many won't like or will not be able to finish but it should at least be given a glance if for no other reason than for its uniqueness. As a final note I would like to say that if anyone tries this series and is turned off by the slow pace that they stick with it for at least the half way point Even I thought it was kind of boring when I first watched it but I stuck with it and now it is one of my favorite animes. Texhnolyze is a unique anime that is hard to explain but if you are into dark stories, cyberpunk, or just sci-fi in general and have a little patience Texhnolyze is at least worth one viewing.  As an added note the series can be violent and graphic at points but when it does it is always for a purpose and never felt unneeded to me.

    Positive: Good looking male lead and a beautiful ending song by Gackt 
Negative: Coma inducing 
I just put this anime in my to watch list and decided to take a look at the first episode because I can't sleep. I thought I'll watch maybe two episodes and hopefully go to sleep but after watching one episode i have to say that the only thing really keeping me awake is that I want to write this review with this anime fresh on the brain. 
The anime started out okay, just showing the male lead looking at himself in the mirror, no big deal, wiping blood off the mirror, okay, woman comes in, whispers something to him, whatever, other random scenes of food cooking on a burner, okay, man putting food in mouth, alrighty, woman is looking up, then down, then up, then shots of hands and hanging hair, then she is straddling him, okay they are doing it, she digs finger in his eye, okay thats odd, he knocks her off, good move, more random shots of stuff, then male lead lays in the sewers and looks at money, more shots of stuff, girls shows up in a mask, looks at guy..... 
17 minutes later, we get some dialogue. 
Seriously, was this anime made by freaking turtles? Was it written by those slow a$$ trees on Lord of the Rings? Everything in this anime is soooooooo sllllllloooooowwwww. Turning a head in slow motion, an eye moving slowly, woman getting knocked off in slow motion, male emo lead looking at cash slowly, girl stares at man for a looooonnnnngggggg time. 
About 10 minutes in I kept looking at the timer on the screen because it felt like I was watching a full length film. I found my eyes closing, which was the only reason I didn't switch it off. Then out of nowhere they try to add some action scenes but it consisted of gunshot sound effects and crumbling pipes here and there and loads of heavy breathing, as if the character's heavy breathing alone is supposed to tell you how dire the situation is. I knew right away that I wasn't going to watch another episode of this garbage. Then when I come here I see a recommendation to watch LAIN if you like this anime, then it all made sense! This is just pretentious, uninteresting emo trash like lain. 
I gave it a 2, one for having some eye candy and one for the ending song, I've heard this song a long time ago and was never able to find it and because of this anime I was able to find it again. :D

    First of this anime is not for everyone, it has a slow pace which i don't mind myself but other people won't; With a complex thoughtful provoking story and a heavy ending, which is not suitable for those who expect a happy ending but keep in mind that the anime itself makes you see this is not happy at all, this anime is Nihilist, that means everything is lost, negativity at is best. 
Story *May contain spoilers that could explain things that you could miss* 
A complex story, really difficult to keep with, i really had to pay attention to it but when i did catch up, i got questions to make and no one to answer, not because i got confused but some things didn't make sense. Texhnolyze is not just about making people into have a robotic part, but more about the research of Eriko ''Doc'' into creating the perfect human/texhnolyzed (Ichise which make sense when is explained and she even falls for his ''creation'') by using this flowers called Laffia that only appears in the city of Lux, and that was the intention from the people of Class the city above Lux but is useless because people above lost hope of keep living and this was one of the things that didn't make sense is a sci-fi not a supernatural anime and what i mean is what happened to them, don't want to spoil but didn't make sense for a sci-fi; That research is used in a different way by Kanno who to me, acted like a kid would act, meaning he wanted everyone to lose what he didn't have in the first place meanwhile there is a war between almost everyone caused because no reason explained by this guy Yoshi (another thing that didn't make sense) who at the beginning met this girl in Gabe (a city below Class) Ran the prophet who saw the future, which was this old man Sage dying, Sage then explains to Yoshi that Ran can see a POSSIBLE future (and she has another role too) and he was right because what she saw didn't happened because it was changed and that's another thing that didn't make sense, in the whole anime Ran says that the future can't be changed but that's not true seeing that Yoshi changed the future before but now it can't be changed just because no reason, when it clearly could be changed, i call that BS. Another thing that didn't make sense was Shinji, when he was headed to shoot everyone in that one place and suddenly he has a human index finger on his texhnolyzed finger and can use it to shoot, that makes no sense, there are a few more examples of nonesensical BS but better mention the story is imperfect and some episodes were there to make it more slower, and not everything is explained or they are explained badly. 
I felt sad watching the fate of Ran and i just cried because of the song played at that last scene, i was expecting a sad ending obviously but that ending was too heavy, maybe if i was new to anime and saw this first i would feel depressed and empty and be Nihilist, but for some reason i didn't felt anything of that, is true i cried a little because of the song and felt shocked with the heavy ending but after it ended i felt normal, not everyone reacts the same but i understood the shock this caused, the hopeless ending. I'm splitted between liking and hating the ending, i'm in the middle. Despite all that for some reason i found the story very good but by a little. 
I think is not my kind of style, where everything had greyish white/black tones, it has colors but they are not vivid, it was more the intention to make it that way to create a dark atmosphere, which i sensed but i wasn't affected by it, but because of that style, it got me thinking that this was not going to have a happy ending, and i appreciated the heads up, and i get this was intentional, the thing is that i found flaws and i didn't felt what the style was meant to make me feel, tho in one part i felt creeped by the shapes at the end. Overall was good. 
The voice acting did a very good job, sometimes i felt that it could be better and they should portray emotions more intense, for example with Ichise, he sounded creepy whenever he screamed of rage and it was good 'cause he scared people but the voice actor seemed had a problem in his throat, because he couldn't scream Ran with despair of not reaching her, almost felt like just by saying Ran was a problem for him to speak. The music is almost little, but the backround songs that are there, are pretty good for the theme, not to mention the great OP and a great ED song that has a melancholic melody but with lyrics that shows hope. Overall was very good. 
I wasn't attached to the characters, i felt they were dull half of the time. 
-Ichise since the beginning is an emotionless character, even before losing his limbs, he was hopeless full of rage and rarely speaked, he suffered a lot, but he develops some feelings and hope because he meets Ran and feels he's her guardian angel and feels he's in debt with Onishi and ''Doc'', he's still emotionless and is hard to get attached to him but you want him to have success. 
-Onishi was really interesting, i liked his character, he always wanted to make everything change for the better, one of the few good people and one of the best characters. 
-Shinji was cool too but he was a little crazy, he's obsessed of being the best, wants to be like Onishi or outbest him, and he was a little dumb at the end. 
-Eriko the sexy beautiful ''Doc'', i was really interested in her, i wanted Ichise to have some feelings for her just like she did for him and i didn't like to see her depressed, if only Ichise wasn't emotionless and said something to cheer her, it would be another story for her, she just wanted to feel loved, that prick. 
-Ran was really dumb, she kept saying the future couldn't be changed, when in the beginning the future changed from what she saw, to be honest, everything is her fault, if only she told Ichise what really would happen, if only she accepted her fate to be the prophet in the first place... oh well. 
There are other good interesting support characters like Yoshi or Touyama etc. but they are interesting and nothing more, they needed more development, good characters in general. 
The anime pace reminds me of Shigurui but Texhnolyze is more complex and both are produced by Madhouse and if you have seen one and liked it, then you must watch the other. I wasn't bored but i was not feeling it until the ep. 15 where everything gets interesting, a shocking heavy ending that is not for everyone or the ones that expects a happy ending, very good enjoyment if you know what you're getting into, just like myself, i was always expecting something bad would happen because the anime makes you think that, a little shocking because it was more than what i expected, it reminded me of Wolf's Rain ending without the last 5 min. of ''happy'' ending.

    Texhnolyze manages to flatline across the scoreboard. Although there are slight variations, it's as though the show itself pursued a 7/10 in every category. That said, let's jump right into things. 
Ichise is a personified existential philosophy which works properly with the constant barrage of philosophy expressed both audibly and symbolically. However, his pursuit for reason is not by constantly asking the other lead characters, but by silently observing as they advance in their personal goals. The biggest antagonist to his questioning nature is the very essence of Lux itself. Very early we are introduced to the nature of change – both in setting and characters. In some narratives, this characteristic is something that is at the hands of the personified antagonist, or the heroic protagonist, but in Texhnolyze, change takes the wheel as the primary antagonist. 
Perhaps what makes Texhnolyze so fascinating is the complimentary nature of Ichise’s unchanging question and the world’s unstoppable evolution. At times, it feels as though the two are not only complimentary, but reciprocals, as Ichise grows toward the ultimate climax and the world around him follows a natural event. It’s masterful, and an absolute beauty to observe. 
That all said, the latter acts are cluttered with stunted plot developments and weak subplots that show change but fail to do it well. However, the show still remains enjoyable. 
Running just short of two seasons, Texhnolyze is a 22-episode long series with a washed color pallet and avant garde stylizing. It really helps exemplify the ‘show don’t tell’ of animation. Though filled with extreme conflict, seldom were there scenes of explicit violence for the first two acts of the show, reserving itself to close reaction shots of the characters. The third and final act is when things become more graphic, and even then it’s still quite tame. It helps emphasize the fact that this anime is not about physical conflict, but cerebral conundrums. 
I did grow tired of the usual locals of Lux as the show progressed. Although Lux is a city in draught (both literally and metaphysically) I would have preferred the latter episodes to bring more life to the scenery. I don't mean that there needs to literally be life, but that the setting must seem real. Seeing the buildings in the background during action sequences or conversations shouldn't feel like a backdrop, but a real world. 
I found the music inspiring for the first act as Ichise grows to learn how to use his texhnolyzed limbs. Less than 15 lines are shared between Ichise and Ran as he traverses the unforgiving town of Lux. The ambience of the music, their silent relationship, and the escalating conflict worked together to tell a story without words. It brought to life the world of Texhnolyze right from the get-go, but this excellent wave hit the beach to early, and the second and third act fail to have the same impact. It’s a shame, considering the early music and emphasis on visuals over dialogue was the best part this show had to offer.  
Mentioned above in the story, but to re-iterate, Ichise is not in league for best MC. He's in league for best personification of a debilitating worldview. It's an excellent character study, but not necessarily for the sake of his own actions, but how we interpret his interpretations of the actions and events surrounding him. In other words, despite his essentially boring nature, he is still a really interesting and compelling character to watch and I was always pleased to see him in the scene. I hope you enjoy his company on screen as much as I did. 
Good! I liked this, but like most shows, I can't turn off my critical lense. It's a shame, because the show had potential to be an above 8. The problem is that the ending has some weak directive decisions that make it a little... well, weak. It's very strange that of the 4 Ueda Yasuyuki influenced shows I've watched (including this one), 2 were less than 8 due to poor directive control at the ending, and one the total opposite, having a boring beginning. Perhaps the biggest let-down was the failure to have proper music played during the last 2 episodes that helped convey the emotional weight of the ending, on both the characters in Texhnolyze and us, the viewers. That said, I can definitely see myself watching this piece again, and will definitely recommend it to friends. 
EDIT 2/1/2017: I just want to mention that there are certain tracks in the OST that, a year later, I am still in love with. There are a LOT of great songs in this anime, and I mean a LOT. The music and atmosphere of this work are captured near perfectly. Not only that, the general experience of this show stuck with me all of 2016 and even into 2017 I just want an excuse to watch it again. I can see myself raising my rating score on a rewatch but for the time being I just wanted to throw this lil tidbit in.

    ""If there's anything you want, anything at all...come to me. I'll be your guardian angel."" 
STORY WARNING: the story is slow paced and tedious so if you know you dont have the patience to watch anything that progresses that slow I wouldn't watch it. 
Art: The art isn't like most anime and has a dark appeal to it. I'd classify the anime as a cyberpunk, because the setting looks really desolate, dark, and not much human life about.  
Sound: The opening was techno-ish and related to the quote I put above, and the ending was GACKT. Who couldn't love GACKT? They also included an ending song for the final episode that was really heartbreaking. 
Character: The protagonist isn't like other cliche protagonist you see. Ichise was the opposite of that. He barely talked, but fit the story well. Most of the characters in this story aren't what you usually see in an anime as well 
Enjoyment: It's one of my favorite anime's because it's a breathe of fresh air. It's the opposite of everything that you would watch today, and really original. I recommend it to anyone that has the patience and time to watch it.

    Style - It is fairly well animated, but the action is often seen from awkward angles which makes it confusing and frustrating. The character design is also not particularly aesthetically pleasing. 2 out of 3.  
Character - The characters are terrible, and I have good reason to believe that the director never intended for the audience to like or relate to any of them. Ichise doesn't know any emotion other than rage, and ends up killing everyone and then dying a lonely death. Oonishi is an idiot who doesn't even understand the organization that he supposedly leads, and ends up getting betrayed. Ran practically never says anything; the only thing we know about her is that she can see the future and she doesn't like it. Doc is another idiot who doesn't understand anything and ends up committing suicide. 0 out of 4 for utterly unlikable and completely forgettable characters.  
Story - The story is utterly awful, in the worst sense of the word. Texhnolyze would have you believe that in the future, mankind gets divided into 2 parts - the normal and sane people live in the surface world, and the violent criminals live in the underground. The normal people end up dying out because....nobody has any children. NOBODY. The mind boggles at how completely stupid and idiotic this is. Also, suddenly SHAPES from nowhere, kill everyone, and then randomly grow roots and die. Completely nonsensical. 0 out of 3 for making absolutely zero sense.  
Overall 2 out of 10 for having a mediocre style, terribad characters and a completely nonsensical plot.

    If all someone expects from anime's art is fan service, no, this isn't your anime. No giant sweat drops. No exaggerated faces. No women written by guys who evidently have never talked to them in their life. No big jock heroes to live through vicariously in the glow of your TV screen. 
The point of art is not to escape, it's to experience. And when it comes to experience, this is maybe one of the few anime not called ""Patlabor 2,"" ""Ghost in the Shell"" or ""Jin Roh"" that do indeed immerse you in a world that is altogether mysterious, but very familiar to anyone who interacts in adult society. In other words, the characters act like actual people; Anyone more than a casual fan of anime should know this is a rarity. 
The art and direction is modeled after no less than Tarkovsky, and it takes quite a few motifs from ""Stalker,"" but whereas that story evoked remote desolation, this one is about societal decay and the fate of our collective species. The plot develops a rich ensemble of characters that resemble actual humans (I can't stress enough how rare this is with anime) whose fates you actually feel for. 
I don't want to say anything else about the story. It's a beautifully depicted surrealist masterpiece on the surface, but the writing of these all too real characters is what makes this a truly unparalleled work of art. 
In sum, this is for anyone who is seeking a sci-fi work that doesn't insult their intelligence or sense of humanity; a diamond in the rough.

    The first half of this series is incredibly predictable and boring.  By episode twelve little is known about the situation or the characters; largely because the show spends way too much time playing lazy music while showing shaky, blurry scenes that ultimately have no point.  A slow pace can work, as long as there is a point and I love psychological dramas.  However, this series felt more suited to entertaining people getting high rather than provoking deep thought. 
Around episode 12 the series gets into some actual plot/ character development and becomes much more interesting.   There are some good moral conundrums, though these fit into the “asking the oldest questions in the newest ways” category.   
The plot wasn’t overly original or complex, and the ending was apparent pretty early on.  I had hoped for a bit more here.  The dynamic between the main characters and the antagonists held a lot of wasted potential.  In general they were all cookie cutter bad guys.  The ultimate antagonist at the end, in particular, lacked any interesting characteristics.    
And, it was depressing.  At some point I started having flashbacks to when I read Upton Sinclair’s ‘The Jungle’.   I wanted to the finish the story, but at the same time I couldn’t help but think “come on . . . would everyone just give up and die already!” 
Overall, I enjoyed parts of this, but there are a lot of more interesting things out there to watch.   
***PS. When the femoral artery in the leg is severed, the person has approximately 3-5 minutes to live before fatally bleeding out.  Having an arm and a leg cut off without immediate medical care would result in shock, loss of consciousness, and death within minutes.  So the part where he is wandering around the city on handmade crutches with a tiny string that is supposed to be a tourniquet he made himself is just laughable.

    Texhnolyze joins Neon Genesis Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost in the Shell, and Ergo Proxy as another supposedly thematically heavy sci-fi show that has a massive split between those who think it’s a masterpiece and those who think it’s pretentious garbage, and the reasons behind the split are similar to these shows as well. When determining a show’s quality, people take different things into consideration and order their priorities differently, such as a show’s viewing experience and a show’s substance. Texhnolyze falls into the category of having a fairly difficult viewing experience as a result of being packed to the brim with psychological aspects and themes, yet it is also these faults in the viewing experience that lead to faults in getting these would be amazing themes across. Texhnolyze boasts some of the least amount of consistency when it comes to the viewing experience, with some episodes being the some of the most tightly written and genuinely enthralling episodes in the medium, while some other episodes you can barely remember upon finishing them. Texhnolyze simultaneously disappoints and satisfies the viewer with its inconsistent yet powerful story. 
Is Texhnolyze boring? One thing that I’ve heard many people complain about is how the first 3/4th of the show is a snorefest, full of random shots of nothing. I personally didn’t find Texhnolyze to be as boring as others say it is, but for all the wrong reasons. The things that grabbed my attention first during my watch of Texhnolyze was how Ichise would always punch girls he was having sex with, and I found it highly humorous. Also, I would always snicker whenever Ichise would fall down the stairs, which happens a lot. However, I ended up genuinely enjoying the show, but there were many moments in the show that left me scratching my head in confusion. Not because the show is 2deep4me to understand, but because… why did that person ride a motorcycle straight into a car? Did he really expect the car to stop? Why are these obviously important people walking down a dark street with no protection, especially if conflicts between the groups are commonplace and isn’t uncommon to get shot with no warning? Whenever a show adds fuel to a fire, I always prefer it to add real organic wood, yet Texhnolyze sometimes adds in the cheap man made shit you find in Costco. (My analogies are weird, I know.) 
For Texhnolyze, the world is the story. The city of Lux (or Lukuss, whatever you wanna call it) is a dystopia so depressing, you wonder why humanity hasn’t gone extinct yet. Despite the extremely weird mindsets and actions some of the characters take, the world still feels like it could exist somehow. Many people believe that a show with such a high sci-fi setting would mean such a story wouldn’t be able to exist. After all, wouldn’t a sci-fi world result in less opportunities for human deaths? Well, it’s the complete opposite for Texhnolyze. Unlike other sci-fi dystopian settings, the technology in Texhnolyze is so underdeveloped, it actually feels like it takes place way back in the past. Texhnolyzation is such an experimental and crude technology, it’s questionable as to why it even exists. Texhnolyze is known for being more of a psychological show, yet it doesn’t need this sci-fi aspect to achieve that. The main purpose for texhnolyzation is to create the main rift between the subgroups of Lux. Other than that, the subplot of texhnolyzation is underexplored and is mainly used as a reason for some expositional scenes, symbolism that doesn’t become apparent until the final few episodes, and contributing to the angst of the main character Ichise. Despite the fact that texhnolyzation wasn’t exactly necessary for the show to get the job done, it wasn’t used in an overly flashy manner and didn’t make the world feel any less believable. In fact, the unnecessity of texhnolyzation could be interpreted as humanity’s desperate yet meaningless desire to go even further, as shown by how the texhnology (is that a term?) stopped working by the end of the series. This symbolized how once you achieve “perfection”, there is no point in moving forward. 
Texhnolyze builds its world by being enigmatic in everything. The dreary atmosphere, Ichise, Ran, Yoshii, and the setting itself, they all feel very distant from the viewer and aren’t fully fleshed out for the sake of keeping the viewer enticed, or turning away the viewer entirely. Texhnolyze doesn’t lay down the lines between good and evil and doesn’t tell you to feel a certain way. It simply shows you its world and whatever you think about it is up to you. Well, that’s what it does for the most part, since like every psychological show that I have a problem with, Texhnolyze may not distinguish exactly which side of a conflict is right or wrong, but it does distinguish which certain individuals are multi-dimensional or straight up assholes. What Texhnolyze does do that’s a big plus in my book is that it still treats characters equally, regardless of whether or not they are assholes or not. The only thing determining a character’s chances of survival are their importance in Lux, and unlike in other anime, the importance of a character isn’t just given to them, but it feels like they either naturally deserve it or earned it. A multi-dimensional character has the same chance of being killed as an asshole character, and that’s a tribute to how realistic Texhnolyze’s world is. In fact, the world of Texhnolyze makes it so that I was questioning whether or not these asshole characters were really assholes, and maybe they were just killed off before they had the chance to show their other sides. Of course, that’s overthinking, but overthinking is something that Texhnolyze’s setting naturally creates. 
Texhnolyze is known for being a fairly dialogue free show, and while this is true to some extent, it is only half true. While this leads to some amazing show don’t tell moments that are genuinely unforgettable and mind numbingly powerful, the inconsistent amount of dialogue works as a negative on both fronts. During some of the scenes with no dialogue, the shots are long and hold very little actual meaning other than… being long. There are episodes where it’s just one long meaningless shot after another, and these episodes are some of the most forgettable episodes in the world. In some other scenes, it’s nonstop expository dialogue with, again, very little actual meaning other than a speck of world building or some insight into some random character. These episodes are also forgettable and lack the impact that the great episodes have. Unfortunately, these episodes can be extremely jarring to get through and while I wasn’t as bored as others, I can understand how these immersion breaking snore inducing episodes can completely ruin the series for others. Texhnolyze employs a lot of the cheesy techniques used to extend the length of an episode, such as people falling in slow motion when shot, people talking unnecessarily when at gunpoint, etc. While I implore those who watch the show to be patient and that the amazing episodes are worth the wait, I will not be surprised nor disagree with those who drop the show due to these unnecessary and painful to watch moments. 
As for the main characters, Ichise is a character who’s angst isn’t hard to understand, yet it’s almost impossible to call his angst “relatable,” since I don’t think any of us see random numbers and bars in our field of vision due to texhnolyzation. However, while we don’t know and probably will never know to what extent these technological enhancements fuel Ichise’s rage, considering his position and his backstory, it isn’t hard to believe that Ichise would at least have some angst built up in him. While not being particularly relatable at first glance, he is easy to empathize with, and he gains more conflicts throughout the story that eventually give a sense of relatability to his character as well. He is also a fairly unpredictable character since he bottles himself up constantly and never really talks, nor do we hear his internal monologue. Instead, we can only assume what he’s thinking through his body movements and facial expressions, which were done very well. Unfortunately, the show uses Ichise as somewhat of a plot device, as he constantly either starts or fuels conflicts with his presence alone. However, what the show also manages to do through stellar directing and the enigmatic nature of the show is to make all of these conflicts through Ichise feel… planned somehow. Even so, Ichise’s convenient habit of jumpstarting plot points and conflicts can break immersion to some degree and can leave you with a bald spot from scratching your head so much. 
Ran is a complete enigma, and while the power to foreshadow the future is… weird for an apparently supernatural free sci-fi world (then again, the whole “hearing the voices of the city” thing was weird too), she’s the personification of the meaningless struggles that the characters go through. She also subtly shapes the events of the show, and the show doesn’t make it clear whether or not the outcomes she’s involved with are what she desires. Her revelation at the end of the series does bring to light the reasons behind her initial enigmatic nature. 
Yoshii is the one who initially sparks the wheels of change within Lux, and his charismatic nature is what initially makes him the easiest character to like. He gives off the first impression of someone who is simply curious in the city of Lux. His motives, although unclear at first, were eventually highlighted during the story, and made his character deceptively complex. He doesn’t simply want to change the city of Lux, he wants to change humanity and stir the passions and beliefs of the residents of Lux as compensation for the lack of humanity that he is exposed to. Unfortunately, Yoshii suffers from being too charismatic, as he is constantly shown to just announce his plans to those he is supposedly about to kill like some kind of cheesy villain. His motives for spurring change within Lux label him as downright insane, yet even so, his terrifyingly calm demeanor of carrying out his plans makes him extremely compelling, and he is one of the few genuinely likeable characters in the show.  Also, his fairly anticlimactic death also gives his efforts a sense of meaningless, which is perfect for the overall message of the show. Yoshii is then replaced by a, in my opinion, much less compelling villain, Kano. He is complete destruction, and doesn’t have the enticingly charismatic nature that made Yoshii so interesting. Even so, his insanity and some of his actions are actually disturbingly justified so a certain degree, which just shows how fucked up Texhnolyze is. He also hits home the “meaningless” theme, highlighted by his backstory with Onishi, and his eventual death felt meaningless because all the damage he created was done. Something that I did appreciate about the villains is how they matched Lux’s setting so well, as they masked their sanity with their ideals and charisma. As expertly said in the 21st episode, Lux was always a crazy city, pretending to be sane. 
A lot of people find that developing characters in a show where everyone dies is meaningless, but that’s the point. Everything is meaningless. Hell, even this review is meaningless, I'm probably just regurgitating points that have already been said a million times over. Texhnolyze is infamous for being pessimistic and nihilistic, with the overall message being that life has no meaning. In fact, the inclusion of all these unnecessary developments, expository dialogue, and long shots of nothing could just be a fancy way of saying “these scenes are meaningless, just like life itself.” These scenes don’t harm the overall message of the show, they are simply negative aspects of the viewing experience, which unfortunately plays a major role in how one perceives these themes. However, despite this extremely depressing message, someone once told me that Texhnolyze’s message is actually ultimately positive, and I have to agree. Texhnolyze is actually optimism disguised as hardcore nihilism and pessimism. While Texhnolyze preaches that human development and life itself is meaningless and that there is always room for death and destruction, it also tells us that death and destruction are meaningless and that there is always room for life, hope, and existence. As for whether or not this is pretentious overthinking is up to the viewer, but as I said before, overthinking is something Texhnolyze naturally creates, and that is why despite its disappointments and flaws, Texhnolyze is ultimately satisfying.

    A cyberpunk series from the creator of Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze is a very dark and gritty anime, filled with lots of violence, sexual scenes and a general feeling of gloom and despair. Set in the underground city of Lux, the series follows several characters who are all caught up in a seemingly inevitable war between the three rival gangs that rule the streets. 
Lain's influence is readily apparent on Texhnolyze. Both are slow, contemplative cyberpunk series which make heavy use of ambient music and visuals. Texhnolyze takes this a little further than Lain did though. If you like your anime fast-paced and uncomplicated, this probably isn't the series for you. 
Texhnolyze is an anime that doesn't really care too much for words, and often prefers to let its images do the talking. This idea is taken to its extreme in the first episode, where there is almost no dialogue throughout, rendering it rather indecipherable and unfriendly to anyone who might want to watch the series. Fortunately, later episodes are not quite so avant-garde, but the series remains a somewhat &quot;quiet&quot; anime, limiting the amount of dialogue spoken and instead making use of implication and symbolism. 
Given this lack of dialogue, it helps that the ambient music is absolutely astounding, contributing enormously to the dark and moody atmosphere. The OP (Guardian Angel by Juno Reactor) is well chosen, fitting the cyberpunk theme perfectly. In fact the music in Texhnolyze is some of the best ever seen in an anime. 
As well as the music, the tone of the series is also made apparent in its art. Lux looks suitably dirty and downtrodden, with a colour palette consisting mostly of browns and greys, and the occasional use of overexposed scenes gives it a menacing look. 
There's loads of violence and despair, and at times it's not the easiest story to follow. Sometimes it can be a bit difficult to work out what's going on, though in fairness it's not the most complicated storyline ever, just difficult to decipher. Unfortunately, although the series has a strong set of characters, we never really get to know them as well as we could have. Also, the pacing is a little too slow at times, particularly at the start of the series. For the first few episodes it almost feels like the series is going absolutely nowhere, but fortunately it picks up the pace after about five episodes or so. Basically, this is not a series for everyone, but if you're willing to accept its flaws then Texhnolyze is a great anime series, recommended to fans of the science fiction and psychological genres in particular.

    First, let's talk about the animation for Texhnolyze: it's Madhouse, so if nothing else you can expect it to deliver visually. This show was animated in 2003 (the same year another, much more famous anime character first lost his arm and leg) and it still holds up surprisingly well even by today's standards. The movements are clean and fluid, colors are surprisingly vibrant and expressive, and the use of off-kilter camera angles and clever cinematography always serves the story well. The characters' faces are refreshingly earthy compared to the exaggerated and cartoonish styles you're probably used to, and when they do become disconcertingly stiff or grotesquely distorted it's always intentional and used to great effect. There are some minor slip-ups here and there, but overall this is a thoroughly solid visual production. 
The music is probably more diverse than it needs to be, and I very much mean that as a compliment. Most of the time, the show does indeed rely either on silence or at most a few light echoic grinds, rings and hums, I think I'll call it an ""angel of death"" sort of sound, but that certainly isn't the limit of its breadth. There are some quaint string pieces, a little sad violin, the occasional angry use of electric guitar to accompany its most violent moments, a smattering of techno, and several other pieces that would be difficult to list. Not all of it sounds particularly memorable on its own, but it's uniformly spot-on in placement and execution. 
Vocally, Texhnolyze is appropriately low-key in both languages, but I don't think it translated particularly well into English, mostly due to the direction. Specifically, the script and direction stick very closely to the original Japanese track, resulting in some awkwardly written lines delivered with unnatural intonations in places, characteristic of some of the less refined dubs of its time. That said, the English track is still serviceable, and despite having some wooden acting at times there are still a few really strong performances mixed in. William Knight, Liam O'Brien and Wendee Lee can be heard taking on at least two roles each, but they handle their roles well enough that it's not really a flaw. Michael McConnohie, Sam Riegel and Patrick Seitz all perform memorably, while some of the less seasoned voices struggle to keep up sometimes. Then there's Victoria Harwood, whose only other role of note is Integra Hellsing. She plays the cool, seductive scientist Doc spectacularly, leaving me wondering why she hasn't had more roles. It's a rough and unpolished dub, and that ironically fits the show just fine. Go with your usual language preference. 
So, there's one thing I need to get out right away, and that is that this show is definitely not for everyone. To put it concisely, this anime is very cold and very unfriendly. I could count on one hand the number of times this show actually tries to make the audience smile or laugh, and on the rare occasion that humor is present it only serves to make the series feel even more disquieting. The entire first episode goes by with almost no dialog, and the episodes that follow are nearly as quiet. None of the characters are ""good people"" in the usual sense. The show focuses heavily on themes of human carnality, specifically sex and violence. It is brutal, cynical, and at times very difficult to watch--not because it's bad, mind, but simply because of what it is. 
I don't doubt that some of you have already decided that you will never watch Texhnolyze, and I respect that decision, but for those still reading there's actually a lot to praise here if you're willing to give the show a chance. It's one of the best anime that will leave you feeling miserable, because throughout its run the story always has a sense of purpose, of saying something about humanity and the world. As I've said, these characters are far from good people, and taken at face value their problems might not seem relatable, but they all stem from very common, very human flaws. Because of these flaws, each character finds him or herself partially responsible for the terrible conflict that ultimately arises--one that ultimately becomes bigger than all of them--they are forced to face themselves and these consequences in their own way. 
There's also an underlying theme of identity, both as a human and as an individual, which ties nicely into texhnolyzation and the role it has in the world presented. This is especially apparent when we learn the origin of Raffia, the substance that makes the process possible. In effect, texhnolyzation represents the lengths humans will go to in order to survive, but then the show takes that concept a step further and asks: ""Do they even deserve to survive?"" As these questions come to the fore, all of the characters have to take a step back and reassess the paths they've been following. Shinji, who's always envied the class, discovers how empty the life he had been striving for really was. Doc, who wanted to use technology to further human evolution, is shunned by her own people for it. Ran's ability to see the future brings nothing but pain to herself and her followers. Ichise's arc is the most subtle yet dynamic of them all, as he slowly comes to terms with his new limbs and his meeting Doc and Onishi prompts him to strive to be less of a stray dog and more of a man. We learn more about his backstory, about how he became who he is and where he'll go from there. He often stumbles and occasionally backtracks, but everything he experiences leaves an impression on him. That's just great character writing. 
That's not to say that this show is without its problems. As mentioned previously, it is exceedingly cold and humorless, and its storyline can get quite obtuse and confusing, which makes it completely inaccessible to wider audiences. It practically demands multiple viewings to understand, but it's such an unapologetic dirge that it's very hard to actually want to. The story can get heavy-handed at times--notably, the show's use of silence in the beginning does have a purpose, but it goes on too long for comfort and as it gets phased out it starts to feel forced and unnatural, though this thankfully goes away after awhile. What ultimately saves Texhnolyze, though, is that despite its extremely dark and cynical overtones, it's never truly biting or hateful. It may be alienating, but it handles its subject matter with passion, reverence and sincerity, for which I can't but applaud it. It's not exactly ""lovable"", but at the very least it's hard not to feel something for these characters and their struggles against an uncaring and unrelenting world. 
At the end of the day, do I recommend Texhnolyze? Yes, but only if it truly interests you. I know that should be obvious, but this show in particular is one I don't think you should force yourself to try out if the concept doesn't appeal to you. If you're at all intrigued by this exercise in exploring the darkest depths of the human condition, though, I highly encourage you to check this one out; it's a thoroughly well-crafted, insightful, surprisingly rewarding experience.

    This is a bleak story about bleak people doing bleak things in a bleak city with a bleak outlook. Oh, and there is a lot of bleakness going on, just in case that did not get through to you the fourth time I said it. Seriously, this show puts the ‘mo in emo like few others.  
Right off the bat you can tell this story is going to require a healthy dose of anti-depressants to sit through. Pick any ugly part of human nature and society and you’ll be sure to see it here. Abuse, power-struggles, self-destruction and then some. There is some serious nihilism going on, I tell you, and the pacing would run backwards if it got any slower. In the end the various strands of the story—the hero’s journey, the gang wars and the changing city--do come together to form a brutally ugly picture of human devolution. It’s like the writers were holding a contest to see how fast their viewers would fall into despair. Jolly bunch, I can tell.  
Ichise: is the sad sod we follow around for the most part as he plods through one desolate panel to another, from one depressingly violent situation to another. I suppose we’re expected to relate to him but for the life of me I couldn’t. He always seems to be drifting and basically doing nothing but follow someone else around. I’m sure that was intentional in order to “make a point” which is why it bugs me. If he had been someone who looked a little more alive and less distant then the story’s ultimate end would have been much more powerful instead of just predictably unimpressive. Go ahead and apply that last sentence to every other character, too.  
Onishi: is one of the various mafias’ top dogs. He seems to be one of the few who are not ready to just keel over and get it over with so he is more sympathetic to the viewer. Still, you know what happens to honourable generals in times of civil war.  
Ran: the prophet girl is very adept at walking around town in her fox mask, looking mysterious and saying as little as possible. Er…that’s it. I really didn’t care what happened to her or why.  
Basically, these characters are not here for the viewer to like, they are just pawns in a game and the story is all about the game. Sorry, but that’s not my cup of tea. For me, it all starts and ends with the characters.  
Every goth’s dream palette: nothing but black and grey all the way. It does set a great atmosphere and a suitably despairing tone and the backgrounds are beautiful to look at, especially if you are feeling quasi-suicidal. It has the post-apocalyptic scenery porn nailed and believe me, the way the plot moved you have ample time to do your sightseeing.  
I actually liked the character design, mostly because I hate the alien moe-turd look and love the realistic style. The story might be a bit too much on the emo side but the animation is really spot-on. It has any number of inventive sequences, works a great feeling and never shies from showing the buckets of blood and gore that are raining here.  
As an aside, here’s a fun exercise for you: jot down the number of people who die violently in this anime and get back to me, because I lost count after the first 50 or so.  
Music:  
Suitably ambient and dark.  
OP: I actually really liked the opening sequence. Plus, you can just take the OP, play it 322 times and you will get the same result as watching the anime.  
ED: skipped it, even if it was Gackt (love you Gackt but after 20 minutes of this anime I need AKB48 to stop thinking about suicide…) 
It took superhuman determination to sit through this over a period of 6 months. To say that it didn’t draw me in would be a colossal understatement. I generally love post-apocalyptic scifi stuff but this felt as appealing as the stuff I found in my fridge when I cleaned it after 3 years. it was just too gritty, too depressing and too bleak.

    I'm going to be honest starting this review, Texhnolyze is a hard show to watch and, as a result, is just as hard to recommend. The reason why I say this is because the series tasks itself with presenting a complex world and cast as simply as it possibly can script-wise. No long bouts of exposition to clue the viewer in on how the world works and a near complete lack of dialogue in the earlier episodes make getting into Texhnolyze somewhat of a sink or swim experience. Those who are curious to properly know the context behind the strange, unexplained imagery of the 1st couple of episodes will make it through. Those looking for instantly appealing and an addicting storyline will be left high-and-dry if they don't want to compromise for this title. Texhnolyze isn’t completely like Angel's Egg, however, it does eventually open its dark heart for all to see and it is disturbingly beautiful to look at.  
The world of Texhnolyze is bizarre in that manages to reflect on the characters living within it. The underground city of Lux is broken, dirty place to be, one where much of the infrastructure seems to be on the verge of collapse. Within the confines of Lux remains only a culture of utter chaos and violence as factions of differing ideals clash over their perceived supremacy. Watching it all unfold is a lesson in the many different things people will use as a crutch in order to desperately climb to an ideal future. From the idea that people should pin their hopes in technological advancements (in this case, the ability to merge man with advanced prosthetic in a process known as Texhnolyzation) to give them the cultural rebirth so desperately needed, to the separate ideals of the individual factions fighting for control over the city. Everyone has a role to play in this decaying setting, except for our main character Ichise. 
Having known only his former life as a prize fighter, Ichise is left without a set path or any sense of identity as he slowly wanders about the crumbling city, unable to face any adversity without violently lashing out like an animal as he's done all throughout his life. Even when enlisted by the Organo (one of the major factions of Lux) his lack of purpose stands in stark contrast with the rest of the cast, people who have nothing but their ambitions to keep them going in these desperate times. The world Ichise is a part of however is one where the hopes and dreams of everyone always come to naught, so striving for anything better is essentially the same as flailing pointlessly against the walls of a cruel fate. Some individuals flaunt their existence more than others, but who will be left to take notice? What will be left behind other then a pile of rubble? Through this Texhnolyze posits that there will be a time in which the efforts of the high-minded and the listless will be both equally crushed to dust and forgotten and thus mankind will die. The inhabitants of Lux inch towards their inevitable collapse, each day a messy combination of sex, violence, and finding sustenance to keep moving onwards for yet another day of sex violence and sustenance. If futility is the one constant amongst the cast, how they cope upon realizing the pointlessness of all they've done is what defines them in the end. Will they take Yoshii's approach and spend their remaining days looking for that which is most amusing? Will they shift gears completely and look to something/someone else for their salvation? Or will they simply give up hope and rot away?  
Not a show to pick up your mood! Though that's something that works in the shows favor for me. It's honest and confident enough with its core material to not add any distractions to the reality of the events by shoehorning in levity or fan-service of any capacity (there are some sex scenes/nudity but given the context of them they aren't exactly titillating). One also should never expect Texhnolyze to really go out of its way to make anyone like or sympathize with these characters. That's not to say doing so is impossible, it's just that it got me to care about its cast of increasingly desperate individuals through characterization that is far more subtle than dropping a character's sad backdrop on our heads all at once in the form of flashbacks. It manages to present the characters motives, philosophies and development without relying on shortcuts to get the viewer emotionally involved. It's the type of characterization that makes the cast feel less like ""characters"" and more like humans by presenting their day-to-day activities with little bias, leaving it up to the viewer to find someone to root for. For much of the show there isn't much of a semblance between heroes and villains save for perhaps Onishi (who strives to keep Lux from falling into utter madness without relying on underhanded tactics like some other members of his faction, the Organo), Yoshii who is essentially an agent of chaos, and the Class whose attitude towards the residents of Lux don't become clear until the later episodes. It's a tale of survival -often survival at the expense of others without really much room ethics. Overall I'd say the cast makes up for their lack of warmth with a surplus of depth, which is fine by me.  
All of this madness and despair is compounded by the top-tier direction which enhances immersion considerably. Sound design and shot composition are work together harmoniously particularly in the opening episodes to give viewers a better idea of what Ichise's confused new lifestyle is like. The series directors will make damn sure you know what it looks to struggle endlessly trying to climb up a staircase after losing a couple of limbs, or how it’s like to wander aimlessly throughout a city while having to adapt to complex prosthetic you never asked for whilst racked with bodily pains. Basic human functions are perfectly handled with bodily functions such as breathing, having sex or just listening to that fucking heart of yours still pulsating in your chest, all being presented their most raw way possible. The brilliant animation/art quality don't hurt much either. The strong visuals and instantly remarkable character designs speak for themselves (this is Madhouse remember? what did you expect?), but the score is quite understated, only perking up noticeably during less slow scenes for the most part. When it is prominent you'll hear an amusing variety of themes that ranges from guitar and violin solos to piano pieces that all fit the series perfectly and are great standalone works too. The standout piece for me is the ending theme by Gackt, which nearly brings tears to my eyes every time I listen to it.  
Texhnolyze is undoubtedly dense and as far as presentation goes, is as unforgiving as the setting it portrays. This is a title that expects a lot from the audience and will leave them behind at a moment’s notice. Everything about Texhnolyze is depressing, slow and often gruesome, but most of all believable in terms of its characters and its arguments. Stick it out through the mentally taxing start and you might never find a more harrowing, visceral think-piece regarding human civilization on its last legs.

    ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** 
Texhnolyze is a cyberpunk series that showcases humanity, both at its best as well as at its worst, oftentimes seamlessly blending the two together in the same moment. Taking place in the dreary underground city of Lux, saturated with a suffocating and oppressive atmosphere, the viewer is soon introduced to several major characters over the course of the first few episodes. Among them are a stoic young man who survives as an entertainment fighter, the resolute leader of a mafia-like organization known as The Organo, a girl with increasingly accurate precognitive abilities that allow her to catch glimpses of the future, an iron-willed group that holds idealistic beliefs, a twisted doctor, a gang of rash hedonists, and, perhaps most importantly, a stranger not from the underground city, but rather from the surface above who begins a slow descent into this dark, dystopian society soon igniting a series of events that will determine the course of the future of humanity forever. 
Among those who worked on Texhnolyze were Chiaki J. Konaka, Yoshitoshi ABe, and Yasuyuki Ueda who had previously collaborated on the uniquely strange and mysteriously bizarre Serial Experiments Lain. Once more they have created another enigmatic series. Chiaki J. Konaka who gained attention as the writer behind Lain has, over the course of his career, acquired a reputation for being involved in writing some of the darkest and most peculiar pieces of work within the medium, each with varying degrees of success. Texhnolyze is among the series that demonstrates his talents strikingly well. ABe's art tends to favor a more realistic design than what is found in most other series and frequently has a gloomy sense of melancholy to it. Within Texhnolyze the creators manage to work a lot of ideas and symbolism into the twenty-two episode run. It is a series in which they want the viewer to inspect and interpret what happens within it for themselves. So what is the point of this series; what value can be found in it? Well, in essence what the creators want to express is something from within, something beautifully human. Texhnolyze is frequently treated as series that is all about nihilism. This is not the case though, it is not about pure nihilism. Rather, to me, it seems to acknowledge and explore it, but ultimately it clearly and wholly rejects it. Texhnolyze is dark and remorseless in the pursuit of its message, but fundamentally inspiring and rife with an optimistic outlook. 
A series from Studio Madhouse made in the early 2000's, Texhnolyze begins with an episode that has (almost) no dialogue. Following after that episode are even more episodes that may, at times, feel very slow-paced. This is a deliberate attempt by those who worked on this project to demonstrate the nature of the slowly crumbling, monotonous lives led by the people within this series. They want the viewer to feel and understand this, making it a brutally slow trek in the early episodes as a result. Now, being slow does not mean it is bad by any means; slow-pacing is not an inherently bad thing as some people may have you believe. As slow as Texhnolyze can be there is almost always something of import occurring during that time. 
Furthermore, Texhnolyze may not be what one would refer to as a ""cool"" series; the ""the rule of cool"" is nonexistent here. There is very little action to be found, it's definitely not fast-paced, there are a grand-total of zero comedic elements in the entire twenty-two episode run-time, and it's the furthest thing from being what one might call a ""happy"" series. Texhnolyze is a series that relishes in treating its audience with respect and letting them draw conclusions for themselves by focusing on showing, rather than telling. I suppose I should emphasize this since from my perspective it is one of the best aspects of Texhnolyze: it loves to show, and will rarely, if ever, tell the viewer what it is actually saying. Thus, the show gently tries to coax the viewer into thinking about the series rather than treating it as pure entertainment. It opens itself up to interpretation of its content, rather than directly stating what it is about.  
Additionally, I suppose it requires mentioning that this series lacks ""likable"" characters which is probably bound to turn away some viewers out there. The ""main"" character will also not be the primary focus of the story in its entirety. There really is no ""main"" character here; rather, it feels more like everyone is equally important for the story to work effectively. Without all these characters, it just would not have been able to work as well as it did. I believe that ""likable"" and/or ""relatable"" characters are not a necessity for a series to be ""good"" and so the value of the characters in this series will not be evaluated upon such a belief that those aspects are requirements. To me, what matters is whether or not the characters within a series are handled well. This is undeniably the case in Texhnolyze, where I can say with utmost confidence that they definitely are. None of them are neglected, and each and every one serves a specific purpose within the story. There are no true ""good guys"" or ""bad guys,"" which is quite gratifying and gives a more believable feeling to the series. Classifying a person as just ""good"" or just ""bad"" seems like an incredibly naive way of thinking to begin with; instead of falling into such a trap, characters within Texhnolyze are treated as though they were an actual human and behave as one might in such a society as the one seen here. The creators wanted the viewers of Texhnolyze to feel and understand the pain the characters experienced in the series. They wanted it conveyed to the audience as clearly as possible—another reason for the slow pacing early on in the series—and so, when characters are injured or events transpire we are readily able to glimpse into their feelings via their facial expressions, their displayed behaviors, and the actions they take.  
The characters in Texhnolyze seem almost like a symbolic representation of a characteristic of humanity. From here, I will begin to discuss heavy spoilers and they will continue all the way until the end of this review. To convey what I want to say as effectively as possible I cannot continue without doing so. Read at your own risk.  
***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*** 
Ichise is an individual that I can see as being a representation of the human will to survive. This is demonstrated by the way he can always be seen crawling around and struggling, but never giving up, as he tries desperately to cling to life. He loses an arm and a leg, yet continues to grapple and fight to survive. Once we consider him to be the human will to live, his days as an underground prize fighter take on an entirely new meaning. He has always been placed in a situation where he must forcefully struggle just to scrape by in life. He is constantly wrestling with and making efforts to push onward, to the point that he seems like a wild animal—a stray dog as the series puts it—but at the same time very much like a human. Ichise frequently makes grunting noises...a lot, but the grunting sounds he makes often do an impeccable job of separating him from other characters and demonstrating that he is an individual who wants to live and will fight to do so. He may have nothing in the world, but he still refuses to passively die. In this way he is a perfect representation of human perseverance. Within the series he is often shown being at the mercy of another, controlled by factors he cannot repel, whether as a prize fighter, as one of Doc's subjects, as a member of the Organo, as one who suffers his own fate, he seems to have very little control over his own life and seeks only his own survival. However, he does in fact have control over his life and his fate. His desire to survive is his choice, thus it is by his own will that he survives. As the will to live should he not have had control over his survival he would not have allowed himself to be subjected to such control to begin with as it would not be in his nature to do so. It must be his choice and no one else's. I would not call him a tragic existence since he has truly lived, and this is expressed most convincingly when he smiles and then subsequently dies at the end. 
Ran can be said to be many things: a prophet, a guide, an oracle. In a metaphorical manner Ran is a character that I can see as representing the future of humanity itself in a sense. She has the ability to see the future because she is the manifestation of humanity's future. She wants to protect the future of humanity and prevent its extinction, a future she has prophesied will occur. It is shown that her visions are not necessarily always going to be correct and they can be changed, something that has to do with fate—fate as written by the individual. Fate can be loved, as fate is controlled by whomsoever it refers to, not the other way around. It is one's own life, and one's life, every aspect of it—the happiness, the pain and the suffering—all of it is their own, and it is by their own choices that their fate exists. Texhnolyze stipulates that ""fate"" is not the result of something beyond one's control, but rather as something that is dictated by one's choices, and by extension one's choices cannot be dictated by fate.  
Why does Ran's prophecy about the extinction of humanity come true, or rather, why is Ran able to predict the future? It may be due to the concept of the eternal recurrence of the same. Everything will play out the same way every time, no matter how times, and it cannot be fought. Ran may not be seeing the future, she may be seeing something that has already occurred many times before. When the future of humanity is effectively gone she asks Oonishi to destroy her (she is The Voice of the City and during the course of the series Oonishi can listen to her without losing his sanity) as she is the cause of the madness in Lux after having shown the residents her visions. The last remaining humans in the city have been consumed by insanity due to the visions she has shown them. If she represents the future it would be a good reason as to why she wanted to protect and help Ichise who represents the will to survive. With no future (Ran) there can be no will to live (Ichise), and with no will to live there can be no future. The actions and lines spoken between these two throughout the series seemed to indicate such an idea to me at least. These two characters have a very sibling-like relationship within the series, and perhaps the best way to describe the relationship between ""the human will to survive"" and the ""future of humanity"" is sibling-like as well. In a way, they are both like the ""children of humanity."" Within the series Ichise, or humanity's will to live, wants to know his future and the answer he ends up getting from Ran is one he rejects, saying he would not let it come to pass. Once Ichise returns to Lux after seeing the surface world of the Theonormals he said something along the lines of ""What choice have I got? I have to protect you,"" to a vision of Ran that he spoke to upon his arrival back in the city (The quote was something like that, it may not be entirely accurate. I think it was in episode 21.). This would also seem like a good indication to me that the ""will to survive"" and the ""future"" need to protect each other if humanity is to truly survive. Ichise has come to that realization that he must protect Ran, the same way she has been protecting him throughout the series.   
The flowers that Ran is frequently shown carrying, selling, and dropping at points in the series are meant to represent the hope for the future. In episode five she drops them into the maze of a sewer that Ichise aimlessly wanders and uses them to guide him (the human will to survive) to her. After he manages to escape his unwilling predicament in this labyrinth he falls unconscious and she leaves a white flower by him. The idea of this flower becomes central to Ichise's character for the remainder of the series. Additionally, note the way this scene where Ichise wanders the sewers mirrors the final scenes of the series as well. As Ichise wanders the sewers his confusion and anger at his inability to find the exit is reflective of his internal state at the time. When Ichise returns to Lux at the end of the series whereupon he begins his trek to find Ran and confront Kano he is calm and understands who he is at this point. He understands that he was capable of change, though he also remained much the same person for even if and when a person changes they are still the same person. Ran leads Ichise out of the sewer; Ichise talks with a vision of Ran as he goes to find her in the final scenes. After Ichise escapes the sewer it is Ran who strokes his head; in the end it is Ichise who carries Ran and returns her to the Raffia. Ran leaves the flower by Ichise's head; Ichise's texhnolyze arm projects a flower. Within the sewers Ichise lies against a wall seemingly resigning himself and giving up; at the end Ichise rests against a pillar and bleeds out as he accepts, with satisfaction this time, that he has lived and can die taking comfort in that fact. As the ""will to live"" it is significant that at the point in the sewers when he has resigned himself, it was almost immediately after that point that Ran, ""the future of humanity,"" reignited his desire to survive by dropping the flowers into the sewer to lead him out. 
Additionally, Ichise lies against a wall/pillar many times (besides the two notable times I mentioned above) over the course of the series, and each time he does this something of importance about him is being conveyed in that instant. This recurrent visual symbolism or cue is meant to stimulate within the viewer an association between Ichise and what he is going through at this point in time. When he lies near a wall, the series is asking the viewer to contemplate what is happening because it is often establishing something significant about him as a character.    
There was a time when I thought that the crude projection of the flower Ichise's texhnolyze arm shows in the last scene was something that the doctor, Eriko, was responsible for because one would assume she is the one who would be responsible for it due to her being the person who gave him the texhnolyze limbs in the first place and repairs them when they are damaged. She knew he liked the flowers. There is a scene where they were walking on the surface and she took notice of him looking at them (episode 19 or 20 I believe). Also, of note about this scene is that when Ichise looks at the flower on the surface it immediately wilts and dies. He then looks back the way they came, towards Lux, and stares in that direction for a few seconds. The wilting flower is a sign that ""hope"" is dying, that the future of humanity is soon to be no more. Eriko witnessed this and while she certainly had come to care about Ichise over the course of the series I have since wondered if Eriko being entirely responsible for the projection within his texhnolyze arm is not actually be the case; in fact, I am almost certain it is not solely her who is responsible for it. Rather, it is more of dual effort. Eriko put it there, but perhaps it is actually Ran who made the projection appear in the last scene (in this way the future and the will to live would die together then). She is the one who controls the texhnolyze limbs through the Obelisk. (Am I remembering this right? Sorry, it has been a while since I've finished the series and I can't recall.) This would also parallel the scene where Ichise wanders the sewers in episode five with the final scenes of the last episode rather well, too. As for the reason why Ran is able to project the flower out of his texhnolyze arm despite (or maybe in spite of) killing her mind as Kano claimed is that Ichise is her last connection to the world. By this way of thinking, the vision of her that walks alongside Ichise as he returns to Lux is not just something in Ichise's head—she is actually there, in a sense. Ichise does end up fulfilling the prophecy of Ran and dying ""alone,"" but at the same time he wasn't truly alone because in a way Ran and the others who he met in his life are there with him, and they also die with him. The thoughts that he truly lived his life and is grateful for this and for those he met along the way lets him die satisfied. The flower projection is a reminder of the hope he found in living. He smiles, one of the only times he does so in the entire series, and slowly fades away.  
Keigo Oonishi represents the order of humanity. He works to ensure that the order of the society of the city will be upheld since he believes that is to better Lux. So, when the order dies—as the people of Lux have gone mad—Oonishi being the incarnation of that order soon dies as well by the very people he strove to help. In the series Oonishi serves as a mentor to Ichise and is almost like a father for him.  
Kazuho Yoshii is a bit like both the irrationality and rationality of humanity. The actions he takes seem extremely irrational to the other characters, but at the time he is trying to prevent Lux from becoming like the terrifyingly bleak surface world. He believes Lux is a ""living"" world unlike the dead one on the surface and does everything he can to prevent it from reaching a similar outcome as that one has. He believes in the ""living"" human. He denies wanting to know his future when Ran asks him if he would like to know it. He doesn't need to know his future because he already knows his life and its meaning. More clearly though, he is widely acknowledged by a majority of those I have talked about this series with, to be the Ubermensch. So being the irrationality and rationality representation is somewhat related. Yoshii is a Man among Men—the Man of Men. Yoshii is the antithesis of the decadence of the surface world. Yoshii embraces his ""fate"" and loves his life, and when he dies, he does so with a smile. 
The doctor, Eriko can represent the advancement of the human species. She believes the texhnolyze limbs are what can help to achieve this. When she returns to the surface she discovers that they have given up on the texhnolyze limbs, she sees they are now ""ghosts,"" apparently the perfection of the human species. She has lost her purpose, and without that purpose she cannot live soon dying thereafter. Within the series Eriko is like a second mother to Ichise as well. To hammer in the fact that the surface world denizens are like ghosts the series goes out of its way to literally have some of them possess the translucent appearance commonly thought to be characteristic of a ghost. 
Shinji, leader of the Racan, is the naivety of humanity. He dreams of being one of The Class. When he eventually discovers their true form he proceeds to kill them. He is killing his dream in a literal sense, and seeing as he is no longer that naive and trusting individual he is meant to represent, he can no longer exist, and is literally killed by his dreams blasting a whole through his chest. He is empty inside, both literally and metaphorically. 
Kano is a representation of solipsism, believing that he is the only thing that he is certain exists. Perhaps he can also even be insanity itself. Though his goals seem to be very sane—he wants to improve mankind—his methods to do so are, what many would agree, insane. He improves humanity by destroying the very things that make them human. Humans are human because they can die and because they maintain their humanity. By disregarding this and turning them into the immortal Shapes he has failed to help mankind, ironically damning them instead. 
Tatsuya Sakimura is a character that I'm not too confident in my description of, but he is a fantasist. He is ""dead"" and resigned to his own end like the surface dwellers, but he is captivated by Yoshii; Yoshii's desires are enthralling to him. He dreams of the world Yoshii envisions. He too, much like Shinji, also kills his dreams (Yoshii) when he sees he has been mortally wounded (episode 10) and with it he returns to the already ""dead"" and seemingly nihilistic surface dweller.  
Motoharu Kimata is the hypocrisy of humanity. He is a leader of a group known as the Salvation Union that rejects the texhnolyze despite being a texhnolyze himself.  
Haruhiko Tooyama is the oversight of humanity. He becomes one of the Shapes and ends up thanking Ichise when he kills him having come to realize that he has made a mistake. By becoming one of the Shapes he has forsaken his humanity. At the point when Ichise kills Tooyama Ichise has decided to return to Lux in order to protect Ran. Ichise's oversight in this case was that he did not realize that he must protect Ran (the future) before and it has now been ""killed"" by his decision to return. Ichise's other oversight was wrongfully blaming his father for the death of his mother and that is ""killed"" as well when he meets the ghost of his father. 
Kohakura is a representation of the treachery of humanity. He does betray the leader of the Organo, Oonishi, but this is not the his biggest act of treachery. His greatest act of disloyalty is to himself. He betrays his own humanity in his decision to become one of The Shapes. He is permanently rooted to the ground facing downwards for an eternity with the rest of The Shapes who betrayed their humanity as well by the end of the series. Lux is meant to represent the Ninth Circle of Hell at this point. These Shapes, who have altered themselves to an unrecognizable existence, ""shaped"" humanity's end. They have inherited the Earth, though it is ultimately meaningless now. 
The different factions within the series can also perhaps be representative of certain things. The Organo is a mafia-like organization that is representative of opportunism, the Salvation Union is fanaticism/idealism, the Racan is hedonism, those of Gabe are determinism, Kano's beliefs are, again, solipsism with maybe some Social Darwinism in there as well, the Theonormals (surface world citizens) are nihilism (Kind of. They are meant to represent the ""Last Man""), and the Class represent religionism. (I'm not too confident in this description for the Class actually. There's probably a better term.)  
The name of the city, Lux, seems to be a rather deceitful title for the underground society—initially, at least. This name which means light is seemingly ironic. You may think it sounds strange calling the dark, dismal city of Lux the city of light and hope, however by the end of the series it is realized that it was. As the viewer we are left with the understanding that the denizens of Lux were indeed the lucky ones when compared to the lives led by those on the surface. Having noticeably been able to maintain their human nature unlike those upon the surface, they never sank into an outright nihilistic (again, not quite nihilism, but it is close) or fruitless existence. They had their humanity, though life was tough, brutal, and cruel, they remained alive although appearing lifeless. They never devolved into the lifestyle of those on the surface who merely live as ghosts awaiting their inevitable end, unable to reproduce, too tired to even do anything, let alone die willingly which the series seems imply they would do if it was not for the effort. The Theonormals are the apparent perfection of humans, they do not suffer from disease, there is no war, there is no struggle, everything they could ever want has been obtained, but they are not ""alive."" They live a decadent life where their only desires are comfort and security, until death finally arrives. 
The art/artstyle of Texhnolyze is bleak, dull, somber, and gloomy. It is coupled with an emotionally evocative soundtrack that does an exceptional job of setting an appropriate tone for the series. Some of the tracks convey a deep sense of desolation, others a great degree of urgency, at other times a track produces a poignant melancholy, and still at other times it provides a gentle tune to exude an air of fragile grace. It is among one of the best soundtracks I've encountered for a series, and it brings me great joy that it both fits the series and is a great soundtrack in its own right.  
Oftentimes, rather than a soundtrack there are some ambient noises that are occurring instead—an effect that is often very prominent in the series directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki. There is a meticulous attention to detail in every aspect of the series: from the outfits the characters wear saying something specific about them, to the backgrounds which are often hidden with a subtle meaning themselves—it manages to capture the tone the series is aiming for. Characters designs had little room for symbolic elements to be implemented due to a desire to make the characters look as human and as realistic as possible. However, there are certain little things there. For example, Ichise's eyes are bright blue, brimming with life; Ran wears a kitsune mask. There is an interaction between light and dark all throughout the course of the series—another trait shared in Hamasaki's shows. There is recurrent usage of a train and train tracks meant to symbolize the progression of humanity (within Lux specifically) and, indeed, when we reach the end of those tracks we have also soon reached the end of the series and the end of Lux. Also, recurring in the series are spinning fans which, too, served a purpose. Often simultaneously setting a tone or being used for atmospheric purposes (also common in other Hamasaki series), I believe they also served another purpose. There is an idea of cycles in the series, as emphasized by the concept of the eternal recurrence of the same. Humanity has run its course from beginning to end, the characters have completed the cycle from life to death—everything eventually completes its cycle and the cycle will repeat eternally.  
Another thing I would like to note is the titles of each episode. From Episode 1's title Stranger where Yoshii, the stranger to the city of Lux in this case, descends into that underground setting, to the tragic irony of Episode 19's Heavenward, to the realization of Episode 20's title Hades referring to the surface once considered by the characters within the series to be a utopian paradise, to the fact that humanity has indeed become a Myth by the end of Episode 22, each title was chosen with calculated and methodical contemplation by the writers.  
Texhnolyze managed to capitalize on all the potential it had in the greatest way possible making it a piece of work that I can wholeheartedly describe as a glorious triumph within the animated medium. Philosophically riveting, thematically rich, psychologically intriguing, and dramatic in remarkable ways, Texhnolyze was a very rewarding experience. The world of Texhnolyze seems like one of absurdism, but I believe that it is about seeking meaning in that meaningless world—an existential series. If it truly seems to someone out there that it is nothing but a tragic, pessimistic series I would greatly disagree and argue otherwise. Texhnolyze ends with the extinction of humanity—an empty age. The final scene is the slow fading away of the city, and finally the slow fading away of Ichise, the endling of the human species—the last living human. Perhaps this ending seems like a completely depressing, soul-crushing conclusion to some, but I disagree. While within the context of the series if the concept of eternal recurrence does exist it would dictate that the same events that occurred will recur again in the world (of the series) eternally, this may not be a ""bad"" thing if looked at more closely. The series derives a lot of its philosophical exploration from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, however it never frames any of what he believes as the ""truth."" In fact, it seems to question or outright reject some of his ideas in a number of places. When the ending of this series is examined a little closer one will find perhaps the most inspiring and optimistic message within it in all of the animated medium. An ending that is nothing short of perfection. An ending that exemplifies what the series wants to express flawlessly. A necessary end. Despite the fact that all who live will inevitably someday meet their end there are still those who can find meaning in their lives—as humans. 
Note: 
- It has been quite a long while since I have actually watched this series so there may be a few inaccuracies within this review so my apologies if there are.

    Prepare to indulge yourself for a depressing ride with a painfully slow pacing in a dystopian setting. I am of course talking about Texhnolyze, which is a psychological, sci-fi anime enriched with mystery and drama, that treats one topic humanity always pondered about: Existentialism. I believe this to be one of the best anime I have watched to date, leaving me with a great impression. Be warned though, this anime is downright depressing and is very hard to get into, and is not suited for mainstream watchers. 
The narrative of Texhnolyze is definitely one of the most outstanding parts of it. This is done subtlety in a slow, but necessary pacing for world building, resulting in careful explanations on inhabitants and society of the underground city Lux. Current society has access to a technology called ""Texhnolyzation"", in which humans are able to have fully operable mechanical bodies. However, there is a gist to it: the population is divided between the people who support Texhnolyzation, those who oppose it and the mysterious group called ""Organ"". Starting off with the main character Ichise, who lost his family, being his father murdered by what he believes is some of his father's friends. Having nothing to aim for, he becomes a full-fledged boxer in an arena. Nothing is pleasant in such an oppresive ambience, leading Ichise to get into a fight with the arena boss. From here on everything derails into a conflict between the different factions, being the main protagonist the trigger. 
Another great characteristic of the story is that it's narrated through the art, soundtrack and minimalistic dialogue, instead of having an external narrator, which is a very positive aspect in my opinion. In fact, in the first quarter of the anime near to no dialogue is provided and everything is a complete mystery, leaving the spectator clueless; afterwards, it becomes apparent with more dialogue and more data is released. At the same time, new characters are introduced and carefully explained throughout the whole duration of the anime, fleshing out the motives and personalities of the cast. Throughout the storyline and characters, more information of the city is revealed or hinted at, as well as its current situation and the inaccessible surface of the Earth. 
As stated earlier, Texhnolyze focuses on Existentialism. This topic really begins to show itself towards the end, which was well performed throughout the pacing of the story.The struggle for survival within Lux proved for the inhabitants a reason to live, while at the same time portraying life as something totally meaningless and bleak. Another aspect to the narrative is the fact that it tries to depict to the audience to what Texhnolyzation leads to: dehumanization and how it slowly eats all of the emotions away. It is downright depressing. 
The characters of Texhnolyze are not the strongest point of the show. A handful of characters are introduced in the beginning, and as the story progresses, even more are shown to the spectator. The problem with this is that most of the characters lack depth and development, as for example in the case of Kano. It is true that the most outstanding ones have defined personalities, yet it doesn't fully try to convey the development and motives to the audience. The gloomy aspect and the depressing story of Texhnolyze was however greatly favoured by the characters. Nevertheless, Ichise's character development was the best among the cast, being a very quiet person who rarely speaks (almost never in fact), characterized by being very aggressive, though opening up a little throughout the anime.  
Back to the motives of the characters, some remained a bit unclear in the beginning, making it confusing for the viewer how to think and feel about that particular character. This is for example in the case of Yoshii, whose motives became clear later on in the story, and it served well to explain/enhance the Existentialism part of the story. There is a thing to note though, Texhnolyze focuses much more on the story and world itself, rather than the characters, which is leads the spectator to not care about the characters, which is a shame, as the more ""boring"" moments of the anime could have been dedicated to character interactions and development. 
~Animation and Sound~ 
The art that was executed in Texhnolyze was well done, though nothing out of the norm for an anime produced in 2003. However, this proved to be a really good medium to relay information to the viewer by changing the different colors and camera angles,giving the viewer a good idea of ""mood"" of the characters and the environment. Other part that was presented well was how the emotional state of the characters were expressed. By zooming in to the characters, as well as zooming out to places, Texhnolyze succeeds in relying meaningful information to enhance the story.  
The voice actors performed their role masterfully, making it possible to really understand the characters personalities as well as the suffering they were enduring (take for example Ichise in the beginning). The mechanical sounds, footsteps, heartbeats and all other effects were done well too. Texhnolyze's soundtrack fitted well with the theme of the anime by using all different kind of sounds (techno mixes, guitar and piano), making it possible to highlight the characters as well as the different environments/places. For me this really made it possible to immerse myself in the story. 
It is great that the anime managed to narrate the story through actions, art style and the soundtrack, and not by simple dialogues. Regarding the original soundtrack of Texhnolyze, it is a shame that some soundtracks were left out, especially the remixed version of ""A Far Away Lightning"", which I really enjoyed. 
Overall Texhnolyze was a fantastic show, but it was downright depressing. Was it enjoyable, as in, was it fun? No, in no way. The very slow pacing, the unknowing beginning and the disheartening themes it presented, left me with a bad feeling after watching it. The characters weren't that great either, yet the different approach and on how subjects were relaid to the viewer, was what really makes this a fantastic anime. I must admit, it was the first anime in a long time that I was able to watch in a very short amount of time.  
It is definitely a worth a try, especially for those who are searching for a sci-fi psychological anime with an interesting story telling, though be warned, it has a very slow pacing, and is not appealing to the mainstream audience. 
Thank you for reading, feedback is always appreciated.

    Texhnolyze is, if nothing else, a condemnation on the notion of ‘truth.’  The annals of human history is littered with clairvoyants, religious sects, philosophers, and even scientists who posit that they ‘know’ the answers.  The preeminent question to which they attempt to answer is: what is the meaning of life? 
But if we ourselves are asking the question (a fabrication of the mind), why should we assume the answer even exists?—Beyond our own conceptions.  Texhnolyze attempts to take a macroscopic view on the history of mankind and its ill-attempts at answering this impossible conundrum. 
Religion is man’s earliest, most persistent attempt at reconciling this ‘problem.’  But religious ‘truth’ requires unconditional loyalty, without room for scrutinization (at least, from the inside).  If such a ‘truth’ demands ‘blind’ devotion, it is no truth at all.  Furthermore, the notion of heaven is a flawed contrivance that evaporates ‘human nature’ all together — eliminating all sense of worth.  “He who obeys, does not listen to himself.” 
The surface ‘utopia’ is the personification of this religious ideal.  A world devoid of ‘primitive’ emotions and all traces of ‘life.’  The omission of daily struggles creates a void that cannot be filled with leisurely activities.  They resigned themselves to a ‘pragmatic’ death, thus rejecting their own will — and, by default, life itself! 
“All the world’s a stage.” — William Shakespeare 
We can never be ‘ourselves’ in a society of social norms and rules.  To follow one’s heart, one must act according to his own will.  Thus, creating a world he can call his ‘own;’ “The will to power.”  It is not only necessary, it is essential.  Life is underlined by the innate urge to rule one’s own ‘world.’  Kazuho Yoshii, a philosopher of sorts, represents the affirmation of life (Nietzsche’s Übermensch).  With the knowledge of humanity’s folly, he seeks to inject Lux with a healthy dose of Dionysian principles.  In an effort to ‘wake’ them up and find a leader who will guide humanity to its next evolutionary stage.  Thus, Yoshii acts on his urges — a key component missing from the surface world — and implores others to do likewise.  The “world is the will to power — and nothing besides!”  But is this, itself, an answer, or a ‘cosmic’ inner force that will eventually lead to self-destruction?  Given the ending and the eventual demise of our own universe, perhaps it is all “a chasing after the wind.”   
The last inkling of hope, as Eriko “Doc” Kamata saw it, was through the unbiased, ‘veracity’ of science.  But is science a stepping stone toward meaning, or a distorted reflection of the universe?  Despite the limitless possibilities of scientific discovery, it promised no absolute truth or progress to a greater purpose. 
“God is dead.”  Heaven is Hell.  The Übermensch is no savior.  Science is not absolute.  Therefore, Texhnolyze does not assert answers or perpetuate traditional ‘moral’ dynamics (right versus wrong).  It presents the ugly reality of life through an artistic medium, “lest we perish from the truth.”

    This analytical review spoils the entirety of Texhnolyze, and is advised only for those who have completed the show.  
Texhnolyze takes a comprehensive look into humanity’s attempts to find meaning when it seems there’s nothing left  to live for. Incessantly crafting an atmosphere of dread and despair through the use of monotonous sound effects, an uncompromising dark color palette, and an emphasis on pain, Texhnolyze captures the brutalistic atmosphere perfect for its narrative. Although it doesn’t hesitate to stretch scenes of despair and focus on seemingly inconsequential chains of event, how much Texhnolyze accomplishes in its run-time is astounding through its sheer focus. At every step of its story, Texhnolyze places great effort on showcasing the effects of the key events on all sides: the effect of the Salvation attack on Onishi visiting Doc and confronting the salvation union, the attention to every step Ichise takes while traversing the tunnel, and the reactions from all sides to Yoshii's attempts to stir up the city are examples. Each event has a consequence for the various factions, and no event from one episode is forgotten in the next. The structure of the episodes also follow a repetitive pattern of begginning with a sense of dread and then ending with a similar dread. As an example, episode 2’s beginning highlights the pain of Ichise losing his arm, and it ends with the despair of failing to move forward. While capturing the unpleasant atmosphere of the series, this repetition of dread contributes to Texhnolyze’s theme of  nothing truly changing. 
As an anime original, Texhnolyze delivers in terms of visual storytelling and directing.  In episode 2, Ichise's imagines a version of himself climbing a set of stairs with his limbs in tact while defiantly looking at the failure of the real Ichise to move forward. Slow and bleak, the pacing and directing of this scene adds to its poignancy. Throughout the show, the characters’ expressions reveal truths they actively hide, as seen by Yoshii's expression of regret through his eyes when killing Onishi's wife and Onishi's seemingly forced expression of remorse for his wife's death. The series uses light in many cases to present myopia or blindness rather than true illumination. During Ichise’s boxing flashback in episode one, he’s portrayed in a shroud of light as he succumbs to his base desires. Nothing is visible as he charges for his punches. Similarly, in one early scene, the details of Lukuss are shown as light fades away to darkness. While light generally depicts hope, it is used in this way to parallel the revalation of the surface world. The bright-colored “heaven” of the surface  is more hopeless than the darkness of the “hell” that is  Lukuss. In the surface itself, Texhnolyze bases some of its scenes and architecture on the works of the American painter, Edward Hooper, who focused on portraying the loneliness and desolation of the 1920s. This stylistic choice is near perfect for portraying the surface world as lonely and sorrowful despite its seeming architectural beauty. As examples, Doc's scene of despair in the surface world directly mirrors the paining ""railroad sunset,"" and the image of the houses on the hill parallel the painting ""corn hill."" Furthermore, Texhnolyze’s uses of symbolism is also noteworthy, mostly with the portrayal of the Shapes. As reinforced by Kohakura’s line about “reviving hell,” the Shapes share a resemblance to the buddhist notion of Preta. Referred to a hungry ghosts, the Preta are portrayed as beings with an extreme level of hunger and thirst but an inability to satiate them. This strongly parallels  those who became Shapes to transcend the body out of greed yet lost their ability to obtain the pleasure they seek. They are ghosts hardly living with a hunger for that which they can no longer attain, as emphasized by Hal's lack of satisfaction after becoming a shape restricted his pursuit of pleasure.  The dragonfly juxtaposed with a dormant Shape near the end of the series serves to contrast its freedom with the stagnancy of the Shape who abandoned the natural order in order to move on but lost agency. Rather than find freedom past the limitations of the human body, the Shape remains forever rooted to the ground. Moreover the series utilizes several visual cues to convey meaning without explaining everything. Onishi’s wife’s insanity is  showcased by her talking on a phone that wasn't even plugged in. This is only noticeable because Onishi plugs the phone back in. Additionally, visual details with Ichise's arm are meaningful. In episode 2, Ichise imagines still having his severed arm in order to prevent falling when he's tripped by Hal and Shinji, to signify that he has yet to be accustomed to this change.  The show also makes a point to emphasize how the difference between Ichise using his normal arm and his technolyzed one contributes to his characterization (elaborated later in this review). Through all of this, Texhnolyze maintains its monotonous style without being devoid of meaning through presentation. Its audiovisual focus cements it as not only a good story but also a good anime. 
Through the use of different factions, Texhnolyze lays the foundation of the core approaches humanity takes in coping with the world, exposing individuals' true nature and their bouts of hypocrisy in the process. The factions and their approaches are revealed gradually throughout the show through their interactions. Texhnolyze is a story that moves beyond long infodumps to conveniently convey all the sides. As a handful of Salvation Union members fail to assasinate the sage of Gabe, the affiliations of the sage with the Organo, the governing faction of Lukuss is established. The Organo is shown to be intricately tied to mining and exporting raffia, the main purpose of the city. From Onishi referring to Ichise as a mere dog in the second episode, the Organo utilizes individuals such as Ichise for the sake of profit (in Ichise's case, through boxing). Through weilding a sword rather than traditional guns or axes, the Organo establishes pride and order. Compared to other factions who either establish freedom among themselves or bind together for a particular ideology, the Organo fulfills the human drive to climb the ladder of society through business, in order to live a prosperous life. As they condone technolyzation for the sake of convenience and the mining of raffia for the sake of profit, they're directly opposed to the Salvation Union, who founded themselves on the principle of spirituality against such technology. The union though tied together by their ideology, isn't bounded by order to nearly the degree that the Organo is, as a fair share of their members are shown to act for their ideology without consultation from their leader. Chanting their motto, ""“Soul, body, truth, salvation, vengeance,"" this group represents the individuals who cope with the state of the world by binding themselves to an ideology greater than themselves and choosing to act upon it beyond all else. This is exemplified when Salvation members fight to the bitter end against the shapes, despite knowing doing would lead to their deaths. For those less interested in following the qualms of society or giving themselves up for an ideal, the Racan exists as a group emphasizing free will. All members are free to do as they please, seeking spectacle and pleasure in life. They actively rebel against the status quo to maintain their worth. Outside of the city of Lukuss, the inhabitants of Gabe instead live under the force of religion, following the words of their seer and accepting the fate they're told will ensue. Rather than make their own choices, they hinge their entire lives on the prophecies that their child seer tells them. If the words of their seer is lost, so are their lives. The Class under the hill serves as the shadow leaders of the city, importing the raffia that the Organo is instructed to mine. Its leader, Kano, represents the will to assert one’s importance to the world.  
Key to note about the factions, primarily the Organo, Salvation Union, Racan and inhabitants of Gabe, is that they encompass the central values individuals may seek to embrace: order and climbing the ladder for prosperity, spirituality, freedom and rebellion, and religion respectively. However, the show also makes a point to showcase the hypocrisy and opposition that may occur in such groups. None of the groups are monolithic. Each one consists of members who at some point challenge the values of the group or a particular decision that takes place. For example, ,after Onishi's diplomatic approach failed against Yoshii's attempt to stir up the city, the minor character Mizuno used this opportunity to compromise the Raffia dig site. Mizuno's plot displays the opposition that would naturally arise in a group of individuals with different moral standings and opinions. Instead of making the Mizuno subplot plot-relevant, it is uncovered by another group of Organo members who operated under the belief that Onishi was framed. The show could have easily ignored how other members would approach the turn of events in order to incorporate the Mizuno sub-plot into the story, but it rightfully chooses to flesh out the different perspectives and oppositions that would take place in the organization. Although the focus on such an irrelevant plot point may disappoint the viewer, it adds to the realism of the inner working and motives of Organo members. Some Organo members such as Toyama show little loyalty to the group itself and are willing to cut their ties when opportunity sees fit. Kohakura himself abandons allegiance to the Organo as a result of Kano's alluring ideology to further the evolution of Lukuss' people. Similarly, the allegiance of members of the Salvation Union is also varied. In addition to those who carry through with their ideology without Kimata's orders, there are those who, when granted an alternative under Kano's Shapes, point out their leader's hypocrisy with technolyzation in order to justify leaving the group. This is in reality just hypocritical justification, since turning themselves to Shapes also opposes their ideology of remaining pure against technology. As expected, the Racan wouldn't be particularly unified due to embracing free will above all else. The leader Shinji's main ally Hal chooses to leave the Racan in order to grow stronger. The two later confront each other in order to maintain their respective freedoms. Outside of the hill, some members of Gabe question the validity of hinging everything upon a seer whose words control their fate. They cannot accept Gabe's conviction in simply accepting the deaths they were fated to undergo and thus choose to abandon their group. The class itself involves opposition in that Kano's ideals aren't supported by the mothers who birthed him. The series makes a point to showcase that no group is truly mindless, that there will always be those who question a group's values or decisions. This is commendable for creating factions that are truly sensible instead of ones merely thrown in for the messages they are meant to convey.  
As a cyberpunk anime, Texhnolyze delivers on its sci-fi concepts. Firstly, the importance of raffia is asserted on a regular basis, suggesting that the city exists for the sole purpose of extracting it. The characters have undergone a century of strife within Lukuss, and raffia, which is able to prevent the bodily response to reject foreign entities, enables the transfer of body parts throughout individuals and the incorporation of technolyzed limbs so that individuals may continue to evolve and survive. Yoshii remarks when he first enters the city that its inhabitants are losing regenerative capacity, which emphasizes the importance of raffia in this state of decline. As the ability to evolve further is key, the Class and Surface World both begin emphasizing Lukuss' role for the purpose of raffia. Technolization, one of the central concepts of the series, is quite conflicting among the characters. Kimata, the leader of the Salvation Union, mentions the rotting effects of technolyzation for both the body and the mind, using his personal experiences with Technolyzation as justification for the harm it causes. Onishi fully accepts his technolyzed legs as not just the substitute of his legs but as his actual legs. It can be seen that technolyzation presents oneself with a higher level of awareness, supported by Onishi's ability to hear the voice of the city and Ichise's ability to detect assassins through his technolyzation (in episode 14 when Doc and Ichise approaches the Class). Toyama chose to be technolyzed solely to assert himself as different from his father. From Onishi's remarks that dogs such as Ichise aren't granted the privilege of technolyzation, it is reserved only for the fortunate, due to how valuable it is as a resource. Ichise's character arc demonstrates the struggles of adapting to technolyzation. Ichise undergoes a gradual process of wholeheartedly accepting his technolyzation process, which isn’t profound for a cyberpunk series but is necessary nonetheless. In terms of mechanics, technolyzation is tied to the Obelisk at the center of Lukuss. The series also establishes a factory that is necessary to provide the power for technolyzation. The shutting down of this tower highlights just how desparate several members of Lukuss are without their technolyzation. Texhnolyze in this way pays full attention to the details necessary to flesh out its concepts of raffia and technolization.  
The introduction of Shapes enables a greater focus on transhumanism, although the series does not focus much on exploring transhumanist ideas. Kano utilizes the Shapes in order to instill his values onto others and force the views he believes are the right course for humanity. For the members of Lukuss who have spent their lives simply living and pursuing the basest of pleasures, the Shapes provide a new step forward in their evolution, a potential means of surviving as society nears its end. It appears that reproduction has ceased, hinted by the absence of children within the story and characters such as Doc who are aware of their infertility without needing to test for it. As such, embracing the Shapes is only natural when no alternative option for survival remains. Some individuals such as Toyama embrace the Shapes as they will pursue whatever will propel them forward, while individuals such as Hal follow the Shapes to satisfy their selfish desires. Hal seeks power and greater freedom than Shinji through becoming a shape, but Shinji himself remarks that Hal has lost his ability for freedom by choosing this path. After becoming a shape, Hal isn't truly living. He's a mere phantom, as the allusion to hungry ghosts would support. Even Hal’s statement that he lost his dick is notable since base pleasures is all members of Lukuss had to live their lives. Given that the Salvation members who stuck to their ideals to the bitter end are portrayed with far more humanity than those who sought after Shapes, the series posits the loss of humanity this danger of trans-humanism results in. Kano and Kohakura remark that the Shapes will continue to live past humanity, but given the repeated twitching the Shapes undergo and Kohakura's infection from gangrene, this appears to be a false hope. The Shapes will likely deteriorate with time, failing to obtain the evolution they desire. The tragedy of the Shapes is effectively depicted by the aforementioned dragonfly juxtaposition. As such, the series suggests the consequences of hinging everything upon trans-humanism. The pursuit of this trans-humanism was understandable given the circumstances. However,  although rejecting it would lead to the same fate of death, it would at the very least grant the individual the freedom to embrace his/her values.  
Texhnolyze’s characters can be quite controversial, as they aren’t prone to as much emotion as many viewers would like. To focus on providing atatchment to the characters isn’t Texhnolyze’s aim, so this is no issue. The show depicts characters who behave how they would under their circumstances and doesn’t choose a specific side amidst the several character stories present. Claiming that the characters are excessively stoic is inaccurate as they show emotion whenever appropriate. Doc demonstrates her lust for power and pleasure when she has sex with Ichise and cuts off the limb of a rat, while she demonstrates despair when rejected by the Class and unneeded by the surface. Ichise is portrayed mostly through primal madness but has instances of calm understanding, when comforting Doc during her rejection by the Class, and showcases respect when coming to terms with his father in the surface world. Onishi carries out a mask of stoicism in order to fit his role as the leader, but this stoicism is questioned when his wife dies. He may try to undergo the formalities without showcasing emotion, but is unable to escape a breakdown when Toyama calls him and abruptly ends the call. Yoshii showcases varied emotion throughout the series, Kano remains bombastic, and Shinji although lifeless in certain cases, has his moments of wildness and liveliness near the end. Even a character such as Ran uses her mask in order to hide her distress in situations. Although Texhnolyze as a tonal piece doesn't have characters that are brimming with emotion, the emotions and moods they take don't come off as forced throughout the series. Some may claim that Texhnolyze characters are flawed by being ideologies and nothing more, but nearly all the important  characters are established well beyond their ideologies. Rand and Kano are the closest to being merely the roles they serve, but even they have the sufficient characterization needed.. Ran possesses child-like pleasure as shown when she's excited by Ichise's revenge against Organo members, and she undergoes the distress that is sensible due to her ability to see the future. Although this doesn't make her a particularly good character, her character is understandable for the child she is without agency. Kano, defined by his god-complex, is characterized well in order to reinforce said god-complex. His view in solipcism, that reality exists in his own mind, is in tandem with his god-complex, and his desire to have metaphorical intercourse with the series parallels the incestuous conditions which lead to his birth. From these character traits, it is reasonable to see that he believes his will is absolute, and given the state of the world at the time, his ambition through the Shapes is sensible. The rest of the central characters are deserving of their own inspection.  
Ichise's journey is the driving force of the series. Beginning as a character with next to no values other than preserving the cells of his dead mother, he sought survival and survival alone. His base nature and desire to live beyond all else brought forth interest from Doc and later Onishi. Of course initially rejecting the Technolyzation he was given, he undergoes a slow process of coming to terms with his technolyzed limbs. While traversing the tunnel he was thrown into by Organo members, he followed flowers that Ran left behind, which after noticing they came from Ran, he began to associate with her. As such, he grew value in Ran even though she herself didn't perceive him to the same degree. In the climax of episode 6, Ichise shows an inability to retaliate against the arm he had lost with his Technolyzed limb,  thus forcing him to achieve vengeance through his ordinary arm. This emphasizes his embracing of himself rather than the arm he was given. Ichise later forms respect for Onishi, likely through the Organo leader’s assistance to him throughout the brawls with the other factions. As such, when Onishi is threatened in episode 10 by Yoshii, Ichise deals a decisive blow to Yoshii with his technolyzed limb, contrasting his inability to use it in episode 6. Through now being accustomed to his limbs, Ichise begins to pursue value and purpose, choosing to join the Organo to meet that intent. He's proven to be unable to control himself when he comes across the ones who framed his parents. Toyama later remarks that he has hardly changed, merely seeking vengeance. Ichise clings to Ran for desperation, knowing that she can tell him his future, which he wishes for due to his desire for purpose. He's haunted by the future he's told by Ran, that he'll destroy everyone around him and become alone, as he's now fond of the connections he's made with individuals such as Onishi and Doc. As he accompanies Doc to approach the Class, he questions whether he truly is destined to abandon those around him and become isolated. As a result, he shows genuine affection towards Doc and comforts her when she believes she has lost everything. As Ichise continues to carry out the orders of the Organo, he questions why exactly he's merely following orders. In an attempt to find purpose within the Organo so that he doesn't isolate himself, he ends up straying from the very self-preservation that defined him. In contrast to his original disposition of living solely for himself, he's no longer even thinking for himself, choosing to follow orders due to his perceived obligation to the Organo. His strife is partially mitigated when the hospitalized Organo Chief, Gotoh, assures him that he must not pay heed to fate and must rather choose to live his own life. When Doc reveals that his Technolyzed unit doesn't actually have his mother's cells, he enters a state of madness but is able to restrain himself from killing Doc. The Ichise of the past clearly wouldn't have restrained himself, so this demonstrates the effect of the ties he's developed with others. After reaching the surface, he quickly understands that those individuals aren't truly living, and adopts an expression of grim understanding. He's prepared to kill the elderly couple who carries out their lives without actually living, in order to ease their pain. Similarly, Ichise is willing to end Toyama's life in order to free the latter from the burden of living as a shape who isn't truly alive. The clash between the two serves as a distinction to the foil that was setup between them. Both had begun as individuals who scorned their fathers and chose to survive against all odds, but Ichise was able to forge connections outside of living for himself. Poignantly, right after the clash, Ichise is able to come to terms with his father's death and apologize for accusing his father of betraying him, thus directly opposing Toyama's inability to let his hatred of his father go. With the death of Onishi at the end, Ichise pleas for his technolyzed limbs to work, claiming that they are his true arm and leg. He has now come to full terms with his circumstances. Having defended himself with his accepted limbs, he reflects upon Ran's role in his life, and how it had a positive influence on him. Though he realizes that he hasn't actually changed, he is able to take satisfaction with the life he has lived. As such, though his fate is tragic, he was able to live his life without regret.  
Toyama's introduced with a repugnance towards those who ""drag down others who try to rise."" To rise and continue living is the central ideal Toyama pursues, and as such nothing frustrates him more than those who live with envy rather than acting for themselves. Due to his father's incestuous feelings for Toyama, he grows a resentment towards him, choosing to follow Kohakura under the Organo as a substitute. He claims that he'll kill his father, but is never able to do so, using the excuse that he'll restrain particularly because it's his father. His relationship with Kohakura is no different, as Kohakura sexually harasses Toyama by touching his butt, yet Toyama does nothing against this. His scenario and abuse doesn't seem to truly change, and he's unable to come to terms with these burdens. For the sake of rebellion against his father alone does he seek technolization, and he's willing to abandon the Organo when he sees fit in order to continue surviving. Toyama seeing those clouds in the surface may be a representation of his ""rise,"" which he emphasized as his main value. But upon wishing to kill Ichise, he perishes, in essence falling immediately after his rise. Toyama spiritually dies when he becomes a shape, the burdens he never comes to term with explaining why he is unable to survive his rise to the surface. By contrast, Ichise is able to come to terms with his father conflict and make the descent back to the city he seeks.  
Yoshii's ideals and values are strongly integral to what the series attempts to convey. Having understood the monotonous lives of those in the surface who aren't truly living, Yoshii strives to stir up Lukuss so that they don't embrace the same complacency. He hopes to unleash their true power so that they can live to their potential. Living in the moment and choosing to embrace spectacle, he doesn't want Ran to tell him his future. He seeks the freedom to be unbounded by such tools as fate. He kills a prostitute and her pimp, realizing that they would be unable to carry out with their goals of escaping the city. Rather than allow them to suffer the burden of failing to reach their goals, he chooses to eliminate them as they are. Yoshii is the character with one of the strongest showing of emotion in the series. He shows vulnerability when his bag is stolen by Racan members, hesitation when killing Onishi's wife, and genuine curiosity in the state of Lukuss. He takes notes for his own sake rather than for the indifferent surface world. He lives with his ideology instead of simply blurting it out. His desire to create conflict among the classes of Lukuss to bait the Class is actively demonstrated rather than explained. At the end of the day, he dies with satisfaction knowing that he lived how he wished to live. He sought his desires for spectacle and pleasure while serving as an influence for Kano's unleashing of his plans and Kohakura's decision to abandon the Organo.  
Doc's character arc and tragic ending is quite relevant for the nihilistic side of Texhnolyze's conclusion. She's a character who is defined initially by pursuing her pleasure, through having sex with Ichise and  chopping off the limbs of a rat. She's drawn to Ichise because of his eyes which resemble the first ancestors of Lukuss and because of Ichise's drive to survive. Through helping Ichise become the most evolved individual in the city, she is able to satiate her desire for purpose and accomplishment. She uses Ichise as a means of reaching her own satisfaction, and when Ichise leaves Onishi's cell for him in episode 7, she resorts to a rat to fill her void for company and meeting of her pleasures. After completing Ichise as her masterpiece, she brings Ichise along with her to move to the Class. Her jealousy of Ichise's respect towards Onishi hints at her growing affection towards Ichise and desire to be acknowledged by him. When Ichise refuses to go with her, she replies that everything including Ichise and the way the city evolves is in her control, singifying that she prides herself on her significance. This sense of significance is shattered when the class rejects her research and achievements with Ichise. She's driven to a state of despair, but is partially consoled by Ichise insinuating that she still has him. Although she’s consulted by Ichise’s reassurance, she realizes that Ichise won't be with her for long. Once the Shapes emerge, in contrast to Ichise's insistence in being obliged to help Onishi, Doc suggests that Ichise should give up on him, uncertain whether Onishi may even be alive. Her sense of selfishness is still intact, but not entirely as she asks Ichise to hug him, to reinforce that such acts are what her technolyzation was for. When she and Ichise leave to the surface, she implants her own cells into Ichise, in order to compensate for lying to Ichise, while also serving as her only means of symbolic reproduction given her infertility. Once the surface has no need for Doc, she has nothing left to live her life, choosing to end herself on the surface rather than returning. Her conclusion serves as the fate that some may come to in such a world, where there's nothing to value and nothing to live for. Although her intentions were selfish, she genuinely cared for Ichise by the end, and one can assume that she placed the flower in Ichise's unit, which was what he ultimately needed during the end of his life.  
Onishi is a character constrained by a mask of obligation. He tries at all costs to fulfill the role he's expected to play. His bravado is present in the beginning when he looks down upon Ichise as a worthless dog who lost his limb. He pursues diplomacy and finds fault in those who pursue violence recklessly. He's the voice of reason when the rest of the factions wish to fight each other due to Yoshii's methods of stirring them up. Seeks diplomatic ties with the Salvation Union after being attacked by rogue Union members, he is hesitant to use force during the conflicts beyond necessity, as shown by his response to the fire. He doesn't seem to show much actual affection to his wife, as he has sexual affairs with his secretary.  However, with the death of his wife, it appears that he forces himself to care for her, undergoing the formalities for the sake of it. Clearly burdened by the scenario, he cannot contain his composure after Toyama calls to inform him about Yoshii and then immediately ends the call. He sought to keep his composure, but such a disturbance prevents this. It is likely that he feels a sense of guilt after the death of his wife, as he no longer makes sexual advances with his secretary. Onishi showcases responsbility by voluntarily offering his ordinary legs, in contrast to Ichise who lost them through recklessness. Although put into question by the Mizuno subplot, he turns his attention to saving Gotoh from Yoshii's assassination attempts of a Class member. Despite the accusations laid on him, Gotoh continues to maintain trust in Onishi due to his genuine sense of duty from visiting the former at the hospital regularly. It is clear that Onishi acts selflessly for the benefit of the city and its inhabitants by ruling responsibly and seeking to minimize tension with other factions. When necessary, he's willing to throw out wounded members in his car to enable his own survival, but he does this by necessity while apologizing for doing so. Onishi seems to realize Ichise's sense of obligation towards him, and remarks that Ichise may leave to the surface world, so that Ichise would no longer be bound to him. Amidst the chaos of the city during its last hours, Onishi maintains his sanity by symbolically cutting his tie with the city, rather than living only to embrace the insanity around him.  
Shinji serves as a direct foil to Onishi, striving for freedom and rebellion compared to Onishi's values of obligation and order. But from his dialogue with Yoshii in episode 5, the latter remarks that Shinji isn't free because he's bounded by his ties to the city. Shinji is considerably lively during the beginning, nonchalantly telling Ichise in episode 2 that he should have joined the Racan to avoid losing his limbs and motivated by the spectacle of Yoshii's fire. However, after opposing Yoshii's assassination attempt of the class member, feeling betrayed to an extent, he undergoes a slump in which he loses his rebellious passion. This may have been bolstered by being  unable to conclude his fight with Onishi is episode 8, as Onishi is a key hindrance to Shinji’s core desires. He’s drawn to Onishi's secretary Micheko, likely due to Micheko's remark that Shinji wishes to be like Onishi. Clearly Shinji wishes to reject this statement, but there is truth to it. Indifferent to Hal leaving, his melancholic attitude in contrast to his previous liveliness ensues. Just as Yoshii remarked Shinji wouldn't be free because he is bound to the city, his ties to the Racan prevent him from living the life of rebellion he longs for. When he ends Hal's life and leaves Yoko behind, he is finally able to embrace his true nature of spectacle and rebellion. He explicitly states in a confrontation with Onishi that he'll kill people while Onishi helps them, directly remarking that he wishes to take the opposite path of Onishi. This serves as a rebellious act directly targeted at Micheko's claim that he wants to be just like Onishi. His defiant nature has truly been satisfied, and he has finally overcome his jealousy of Onishi.  He remarks how pitiful the Class that he longed to join really is, and he lives the last moments of his life killing the raffia statues in the Class' headquarters. Killed during that moment, he died while obtaining the very spectacle he longed for, after he was able to escape the restrictions of his den and by extension his city.  
Before delving into how Texhnolyze utilizes all this characterization for its conclusion, there are some issues with the show worth mentioning. Firstly, plot armor is present in many instances. Ichise or Onishi dodge a barrage of bullets unscathed, and Ichise’s ability to defeat an entire crowd with his technolyzed limb requires suspension of disbelief. One may also question Ichise's relationship with Ran to some extent. The show places great emphasis on Ichise's value for Ran, but this value in series relates almost solely to Ichise noticing that Ran provided the flowers that helped him in the tunnel and thus could have benefited from a stronger relationship. Related to this, in episode 11, Ichise is led to believe Ran knows something about him, but it isn't clear what made him reach such a conclusion. He has no reason to suspect Ran's ability to tell the future, so this interaction is a reasonable criticism. Ran's connection to Kano at the end was far too abrupt and required more elaboration. How exactly Ran relates to the Obelisk is also left unexplained, and her role as the voice speaking to Onishi isn’t an integral twist. The series also includes moments of symbolism that betray realism during certain points. The blood that arises when Onishi destroys the Obelisk with his sword makes no literal sense, and the Surface World treads the line between reality and the illusory for a symbolic purpose that could be again questionable from a literal standpoint. Konaka's Serial Experiments Lain has non-literal aspects like this, but since that show is metaphorical in its entirety, there's no disparity compared to the more grounded Texhnolze. Ultimately, these aren’t major faults with the series. Although a fair share of these problems arose during the end, the ending is overall the strongest point of the series.  
When Ichise, Doc, and Sakimura reach the surface world, the viewer's expectations are shattered by the true nature of this seeming heaven. In contrast to the city of Lukuss whose people were at the very least living, the inhabitants of the surface are nothing but ghosts, simply reflecting upon their past lives without actually living. Atmospherically, this world is interesting from instances such as a seemingly normal flower being revealed to have withered away in reality. When Sakimura informed his supervisor about his killing of Yoshii, he is driven to despair but his supervisor just assures him that he probably did a good job with the task. From this, we can surmise that the theonormals posses no value of morality, simply paying heed to whether a task was done as it should be. There's a strong emphasis on formality for the sake of formality, and the inhabitants are completely indifferent to Doc's message that Kano's Shapes would attack. They've given up on life. Nothing truly matters, and they import raffia by habit alone. The radios continue to repeat the same pointless lines, to emphasize the sheer meaninglessness of the surface and everything they do. Doc is driven to despair by this meaninglessness and her inability to attain the purpose and acknowledgement she wishes for. An old man assures Ichise of the merits of not having a last name, as he's bounded to one fewer thing. Ichise remarks that the old man should visit Lukuss, for the inhabitants are at the very least living there. Essentially, the twist of the surface world lays into question what it truly means to live. There are those who simply go about their lives with complacency and there are those who although they suffer, at least have something to live for. Although the approach of the theonormals to simply give up on life isn't necessarily wrong, it is clear that individuals such as Ichise would be unsatisfied with that alone. As an individual seeking meaning, he descends back to Lukuss, to meet the fate he's bound to meet. At the very least, Ichise is satisfied with his life's conclusion, for he is able to reflect upon the life he lived and the relationships he forged. The flower grants him hope despite his tragic end. He may not have actually changed, but he at the very least lived a life, found people to value and memories to cherish. 
More important to Texhnolyze is how the elements of the ending fully wrap up all the perspectives present within the series. Texhnolyze provides a vast array of potential approaches to life. Ichise strives for self-preservation and to find meaning, while Kano strives to maintain his values to others and assert his own meaning by awaking everyone's egoism. Toyama desires to rise beyond all else,  Shinji attempts to live with satisfaction by seeking rebellion and Doc externalizes her goal through furthering Ichise's evolution and striving to be needed by others.  The Salvation Union is willing to die for their cause, maintaining their value of the natural body. Members of Gabe cling to fate rather than acting on their own, Yoshii strives to unleash the potential of the people and live to hedonism, and the surface decides to give up on life. It is questioned whether anything really changes, for the cycle of death and rebirth of cities is stated to be continuous, and Ichise's own journey ends with a punch just like how it began (punching Kano at the end compared to punching the prostitute during the begginning). The different conclusions the series presents are quite varied. It presents characters who live their lives with satisfaction: Ichise as he reflects upon the life he's lived, Shinji as he lives the way he always wished to live, Yoshii as he lived and fueled the spark for others to live, and the Salvation Union as they pursue their ideals without hesitation. It also presents the tragedy of those who have given up, either choosing to end their lives such as Doc or Ran, or choosing to meet their fates such as the members of the surface. Onishi, though he met a tragic end, at the very least kept his sanity. Characters such as Hal and Toyama died in folly, but served to enable Shinji and Ichise respectively to live their true lives. Texhnolyze weaves its various perspectives and approaches to meaning almost seamlessly, utilizing its 22 episodes to build-up the components that each character and faction would require. And although the folly of approaches such as Hal's is highlighted, the show doesn't present a particular approach as the correct one. Ultimately, Texhnolyze isn't a propaganda piece with a message it's trying to convey. It shows the sides of the conflict, what the world and one's way of living within it means for each of them, but there's no correct answer. It is as if through these perspectives, the show encapsulate the core of humanity for what it is. Texhnolyze is a study of the way people fundamentally approach life and the conclusions they are lead to.  The ending may lead the viewer in a sort of void ,from the sheer overwhelming nature of a world with no overarching meaning or truth. ""Walking Through the Empty Age,"" the music that plays during the last few minutes of the final episode, perfectly captures the melancholic yet contemplative mood that this ending entails. 
Final Verdict: 
When all is said and done, Texhnolyze is a show that's thematically satisfying.  It's a series that is focused from beginning to end, one that is indifferent to whether the viewer is invested and instead simply tells its story. It's an anime that takes care in executing the characters it tries to convey, utilizes visuals to contribute to the story and presents one of the most thematically rich stories the medium has to offer. It may have a few minor issues in its execution, but it effectively explores the many sides to the concepts and perspectives it focuses on. As such, it is possibly one of the greatest works the anime medium has to offer.

    What it offers is certainly not something everyone is going to desire. It is an extremely dystopian narrative that ultimately takes an even extremer standpoint when it comes to its nihilistic undertones. In a truly soul-crushing way Texhnolyze offers very little hope, cementing itself as the bleakest dystopian rendering I have been exposed to, or rather, endured to date. That isn’t to say it doesn’t have its tender moments because it does in a sense, yet they are few and far between; largely being overshadowed by the 'negatives'. But is that really such a bad thing? For some that answer will be yes. For those that are a little more open minded or enjoy the dystopian and cyberpunk genres all I can say is you’re in for a one of a kind series. Texhnolyze may very well be the pinnacle of the cyberpunk and dystopian genres. 
Like many of its cyberpunk counterparts, it's a rather brazen series, yet it is able to steer clear of becoming pretentious for the most part. It strikes a beautiful balance between the existential questions it asks and progression of its story, characters and world. Texhnolyze doesn’t pander to its viewer, nor does it stop to let you catch up or explain every single one of its actions in detail. In fact, a lot of questions aren’t answered until the final episodes. It is by no means flawless and it certainly gets muddled up in trying to do too much. Because of this there is an air of ambiguity throughout a large portion of the series which often impacts on what it’s trying to say. In spite of this Texhnolyze still says something and as it comes full circle it undoubtedly answers its questions. 
It's an exceedingly costive series that initially focuses more on the world, its atmosphere and tone rather than progressing the story itself. The inception highlights this largely through its tedious pacing, character interactions and sound rather than its sparse words. Texhnolyze gradually picks up momentum as Lux - the crucible of humanity, their home - is thrown into disarray. Rising tensions between differing philosophies spiral into violence and civil war.  
It’s worth noting that a common theme of cyberpunk is the dehumanization of humanity through the futuristic technology they generally play off. That is not necessarily the case here which is why as I referenced earlier, the series is not without its warmer moments. While there are certainly doctrines within that support the dehumanization of humanity, there are also those that see texhnolyzation as a means to further humanity. A mechanism of hope rather than destruction.  
Boasting some of the most impressive art and animation of its time, Texhnolyze puts large emphasis on its visuals to establish and develop its characters and brutal world. Though few and far between, the fight scenes are animated flawlessly and smoothly, similarly the palette of colors is both aesthetically pleasing whilst also highlighting the dystopian nature of Lux and the surface world. The art truly stands out as one of its focal points, and it’s for good reason. The series uses a plethora of techniques and pays significant attention to even the smallest details. The use of grainy scenes often compliments what the story is trying to project, depicting a savage and unforgiving world. The art style simply reflects what it's trying to say. The juxtaposition of warm colors on the surface further proves this. Furthermore the surface world references a number of Edward Hopper’s paintings - a man who is known for his depiction of stark and barren landscapes - through color and content alike. Texhnolyze and Hopper mirror each other both visually and thematically. The art and its detail adds a level not many series can compare to, just as well given how much of a visual experience it truly is. 
The sound compliments its art and world masterfully. The interplay between the two is refreshing and ultimately what makes it such a sensory and memorable experience. The voice acting speaks volumes whilst ironically, little is said. The heavy breathing of Ichise emphasizes this more than anything, highlighting how much of an arduous struggle it is to simply live. The sound effects are clear and relevant; footsteps, trains, the mechanical eyes of its Texhnolyzed patients and gunshots come alive heightening the series as a whole. As with the grainy animation technique, static sound is used to project the point further. But most importantly, Texhnolyze’s soundtrack is the greatest score of any anime I have watched to date from both an external and internal perspective. Over forty tracks allow for a diverse yet distinct soundtrack that always compliments its visuals and world. The music dredges all sorts of emotion and the sheer pathos provided by the combination of its moving and excellently placed music provides an experience few anime can compare to. 
Texhnolyze offers a heterogeneous ensemble of characters each with their own philosophies and it’s these beliefs that separate the citizens of Lux and conflict with one another. Ultimately, Texhnolyze leaves a number of characters underdeveloped and fails to fulfill the potential for some. Understandably so, the characters may be one of the biggest factors of deterrence. Some characters don’t get the screen time they deserve, some don’t get the development they deserve. In spite of this, there is still plenty of character development for the more focal characters. Ichise’s development - largely standing out - over the course of his plight is remarkable if not poetic. Characters develop in both a positive and negative light, realistically so, and while in some cases the series leaves development to be desired, it’s forgivable given the respectable amount of characters it explores and its emphasis on the world rather than its characters. 
Texhnolyze is not without its flaws, yet in the end they are easily accepted. As a whole, it is something truly great. The amalgamation of even the finest details creates a series that’s merit is comparable only to few. Whether it’s sheer patience and willpower, or its philosophical questions of existentialism, Texhnolyze not only asks a lot of its viewer, but respects them. If you’re able to answer its call, Texhnolyze is something truly rewarding and memorable. Texhnolyze is truly a masterpiece. 
Thanks for taking the time to read.

    To call Texhnolyze one of the most predictable stories is an understatement. The only expectation it defied was the exepctation to be worthwhile. Other than that, this is your typical artsy anime. It beats you over the head with how artsy it is, using techniques that distinguishes it from mainstream anime. None of these techniques distinguishes it from the many ‘artistic’ stories out there. It often looks like an immature, more angsty little brother of Blade Runner or Eraserhead. 
Is there a more redundant way to inform your audience that your story is serious by having grey colours and serious characters? Nolan used the same technique in Inception and made a complete fool of himself. He was so focused on being serious that hsi dreams looked like Michael Bay directed them. 
The anime doesn’t follow an idea of its own. The directors behind it watched a bunch of art house films, noticed the lack of dialogue in Blade Runner and decided that this is the reason it got the acclaim. 
Being serious isn’t going to make me take your story seriously. Halfway through the series and all the characters still act the same. They all present the same variation of the stoic, apathetic characters. Some are less stoic than others, but that’s like saying there’s a major difference between New York Hardcore and Beatdown Hardcore. They more similar than they are different. 
After 20 episodes, the 100th shot of Ichise’s indifferent, emotionless face is hilarious. It reeks of trying too hard. Is the life of people in harsh environments like this? Did the Jews in the Holocaust or the fighters in Sudan had time to just stare off into the distant with a stoic face? 
Think of any photograph of a war-torned or poverty-stricked place. Do the people have the privilege of being stoic? No. These photographs are harrowing because they’re full of pain and suffering. These are people who want life and struggle to survive, to find some kind of joy in it. Stories from Holocaust survivors are full of these moments. They’re not stoic but swinging from one extreme painful moment to a small relief of happiness. 
The only place that actually is monotonous is your office job and suburban job. Texhnolyze is full of angst, the kind your suburuban dad gets after 20 years in the same job. It’s your boring monotonous pessimism you hear from a teenager when every day is exactly the same. 
Actually, comparing this to teen angst is a compliment. Teen angst is an existensial storm of ups and downs, like that Nine Inch Nails album. It can be silly but it’s exciting. Texhnolyze is macho angst. It’s the same thing that fuels Game of Thrones and Cormac McCarthy novels. The old macho fantasy of men in suits not expressing emotions is a big hit now and is often confused with depth. The only surprise is that Texhnolyze doesn’t have graphic sexual abuse (Although we do get a sexy doctor). 
You cannot horrify the audience by constantly showing suffering. Humans adapt. When feel something too much we get used to it and our perspective changes. Texhnolyze has the same emotional tone throughout the series. 
Bleakness and grimdarkness cannot be leading tones. They’re too narrow. You can use them in certain scenes but unless you’re doing something especially unusual there’s nothing there. You need to contrast it with something. People don’t suffer because they don’t have something. People suffer because they don’t have something that they want. 
There are plenty of tragic and dark works out there, but they’re effective because they’re aware suffering doesn’t exist in a vacuum. You don’t have to show a moment of joy. Just showing it can exist in your world is enough. I only have to skim over Serial Experiments Lain to find a shot of girls laughing in bright colors. This is enough to inform me that in the world of Lain, people can be happy. 
Some moments have potential to offer contrast, but the mood suffocates it. A sex scene is in dark colors and full of dread. We see a party, but there breaks Hal’s heart. It is a flat line, which means it’s both shallow and dead. 
If Texhnolyze found a unique way to express the grimdark cliche, I would have forgiven it. If it would have gone full retard in the Techno-Industrial depart it would be a little fun. While the soundtrack is nice, the scenery never reminded me of Front Line Assembly. The decay gets more focus than the mechanical nature. The focus is on the mood, rather on something that will create the mood. This is no City of Rapture. 
The most radical switch from this mood is the action scenes. The anime joins BTOOOM! and Deadman Wonderland by bathing in blood and faces distorting in pain. The show already established a cold, stoic tone. When these scenes kick in, the violence isn’t harrowing. The scenes don’t reveal any pain because we were already beaten the head with pain before. So all they do is take the suffering one step further, showing it more explicitly. Someone should’ve told them that what makes pictures from the Holocaust or Unit 731 harrowing is because we know these are real people. The people in Texhnolyze aren’t real. 
There’s a revealing interview with the creators. They said these action scenes were a response to the Shounen Jump style violence, where characters walk away bleeding. The creators wanted to express ‘pain’. If they had any understanding of action films, they would have known they are not about pain. Action anime is about aestheticized violence, about making violence look really cool. 
Asking what the creators wanted to communicate, they said they don’t have any idea. They admit things changed as they series went along and that’s it. He hoped that the viewer would feel some kind of empathy or that they will think ‘this might mean this’. Does that sound like a work which involved deep thought? 
I did not want the creator to analyze his own work. Still, I expected them to have some kind of direction. Lynch saying he sees absurditiy and weirdness all around him is enough to give you some idea what his films try to express. 
If Texhnolyze was a mess of ideas it would still be amusing. If it jumped off from one idea to the next it would at least be there. Not knowing what it’s about, instead, makes for an anime that never builds towards anything. The tone never changes, since they never know what it was about in the beginning so they had no foundation to build upon. It ends with a big battle and an antagonist who’s a rip-off on Fallout‘s The Master only without the charisma, humor and the depth. 
I engaged in a long debate with hopes of finding value. While the person raised a lot of valid points and there is something here about the nature of existence and ‘being human’, it’s not conveyed. I engaged in that debate while watching the last episodes. They’re an improvement and the above-ground is a great idea, but the stoic mood and boring violence overpowered any depth there could have been. You don’t cover depth and ideas with a boring story. Your cover needs to serve the ideas, not obscure them. 
Some also told me the characters are not the point, but if this is about humanity they must be the point. You cannot have a story about human nature or existence without characters. Existence and stories don’t exist outside of characters. You can have a story without many things. You can have a story that’s just an inner monologue, but without characters the only thing you can write about is asteroids hitting planets and blowing shit up. That’s just a Michael Bay story without women. 
Perhaps I’m an idiot. Perhaps there is something deeper beneath the 100 shots of apathetic and ultra macho faces. Perhaps everyone just jumps on the bandwagon of grimdark and think that if the anime has a serious tone, then we must take it seriously. I’ve experienced plenty of strange and ‘artistic’ stories. Most of them were weird enough to be interesting for a while even if they failed. Texhnolyze is a predictably artsy anime that can’t escape its trap. Even if it says something about existence or optimism, in the end it wants too much to be serious and everything is dead. 
Additional content: Style and substance aren't the same, but they're linked together. Texhnolyze does have interesting ideas and ambitions, yes. It does end on a slightly more positive note, which makes in unique in the reality of grimdark stories. 
However, the style of the show prevents all of these ideas to surface. There are different personalities, but they are more similar than they are different in their toughness and stoicness. The series tries too hard to set atmosphere, spending too much time on it than other 'atmospheric' works like Mushishi or SEL. Moreover, the atmosphere is incredibly generic. Mushishi has the mysterious, indifferent nature thing going on. SEL has the digital-paranoia going on (Even if it's not very original, it's at least specific). Texhnolyze sometimes points to an Industrial-Apocalyptic decay thing, but most of the time it's just really grim and dark. Lux isn't defined by a specific aesthetic but just a general tone of Really Bad Life. 
Texhnolyze is actually my type of anime. I love cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic stories, the theme of technology and progress and weird narratives. I'm a pessimist, so I'm all for dealing with life's harshest realities. Texhnolyze was boring because it wasn't challenging or weird or exciting enough. If Texhnolyze was truly bizarre, I would've forgiven its flaws. Instead, I just felt like I've seen it all before.

    Texhnolyze has a special place in my collection, if I really had to choose my favourite anime, in the end, I'd probably go with this. It ticks all the boxes for me. I'm in my 20's and I think this series would appeal more to those around that kind of age group. It's a dark, mature, brooding and brutal series. I can completely empathise with those who don't get along with this series because as most other fans of the show have said, it's not for everyone.  
I'm a fan of a good dark series  and that sums it up. I don't find it despressing (though some might), I find it interesting. The series is slow throughout which works perfectly, it just fits with what Texhnolyze is. The story itself starts fairly simple and stays that way for some time, to the point where some may think there's nothing to it but you have to stick with it. As the story progresses in the second half of the series, things get a little more complex and as you reach the end of the series, that's when you need to start thinking about it a bit more. The entire series has good replay value becuase the more you watch, the more you start to take in. This really is one of those series that can be discussed over and over, for those who really care. 
Texhnolyze is a violent, sometimes controversial series. There are parts of it which might make some people cringe but that's only one aspect of it. That side of the series certainly doesn't make it. The brutality of it all just adds to the general feel of 'no hope' that you get from the story. 
The characters don't necessarily feel like your average anime characters. They're very real, urban characters. There's not that silliness about them that you sometimes get from other series. There's nothing funny and often nothing likable about them. They always come off as very serious. They can sometimes feel monotonous but that's what makes this series so different. Yoshii is an incredible character, among my top anime characters. 
Again, everything works well with this series, including the artwork. There's a feel of the Boogiepop Phantom series in there. That gloominess. If you liked the artwork for Shigurui, then you're like this. 
As far as music is concerned, the final song at the very end of the series is memorable and poignant. I just loved that song and it goes so well with the great ending. 
Onto the negatives, well, some people will find the whole series entirely negative, go into it with an open mind. The only one negative I can think of that really bummed me out was the death of one of the key characters halfway through the series. In many ways, he felt like the main protagonist of the entire series. The next few episodes after this death gave me a sense that the series was going to lose steam, everything just felt a little underwhelming. However the story does pick up again, when the 'new' protagonist is introduced. 
Overall then, a series well worth watching at least once. I can ask that you give it a chance, try to watch it to the very ending. It is a sad tale but I found it very rewarding in the end. Like Lain, you have to make your own conclusions, it's very philosophical. It's as close to 10 as I can get.

    Texhnolyze: A Meaningless Existence 
This is not exactly a review in the conventional sense, as it mostly focuses on analyzing the series as a whole rather than exploring the technicalities of each aspect which makes up the series.  
**This “review” is SPOILER-HEAVY and is recommended for those who have already seen the series.** 
**This “review” is also FAR from complete and I will be continually updating it in the future as I better collect more of my thoughts.** 
This analysis may be somewhat messily written or seem to lack any sort of overarching structure. It is merely my personal thoughts and things I've realized while watching the series. 
Texhnolyze, taking place in the underground city of Lux, is not exactly a ""fun show"" that one would watch for enjoyment, understandably a show that I would not expect everyone to enjoy. It is extremely minimalist, Ichise not even speaking a word for the first three whole episodes. The series doesn't force the viewer to like it though. I found it to be pure in the sense of which it doesn't attempt to insert comedy to lighten the mood, or a likeable cast, or a huge amount of drama to draw the attention of the audience. It's not a cop-out at the very least. It is presented as what it is, the slow grinding halt of the human race, depicting violence and suffering without holding anything back. The plot is rather straightforward and the series isn't too difficult to understand. The characters, while extremely dull at points, grew on me to be very respectable by the end. They actually seem to be stand-ins for ideals and concepts rather than “actual characters” at times. The message and truth it depicted is also one of the best I've seen across all mediums. What is perceived to be among the darkest titles in the medium is actually a story of hope and may actually be one of the most uplifting anime in existence. 
Texhnolyze once again focuses on the “lack of” in its presentation. In many cases it lacks sound, parts of it being either completely silent, or merely having the sound effects of characters walking and technology buzzing about. In this sense, it is a very quiet show, and this creates a “reflective” atmosphere, allowing the viewer to look closely at what it is trying to present and interpret it for themselves.  The color scheme on the other hand, is mostly dark, the shades being rather close to one another, and this serves to create a dark atmosphere within the city of Lux, depicting it similarly to how a “hell” could be imagined, which in turn sets up a great contrast with the surface, which could turn out to be another hell in actuality despite being brighter and having more light. Throughout the entirety of the show, one could be convinced that Lux is “hell,” while it could actually be seen as the opposite such, a place where life is still “believed” to have value. Most of what it depicts is exclusively people killing, fucking and eating, merely going about their most primal instincts and nothing more. 
The “belief” that life is still worth living is where Yoshii plays in. Yoshii descends from the surface to, in a sense, preserve humanity’s will to live. He has witnessed the inevitable decline of the species on the surface and to a degree he creates chaos to ensure that the same does not happen to Lux. In this chaos, people certainly die, but Yoshii recognizes that everyone should die either way, whether it be going out with a bang, or slowly wasting away until the inevitable end. Since he knows that the fate is sealed either way, Yoshii does not seem to “fear death,” and lives in the moment, rather hedonistic, his actions knowing no consequence because he does not care about the consequences in the first place. What could be considered the “greatest consequence” in most cases? Usually it would be death, but since he knows he is going to die anyway, there is nothing left to threaten him. He does what he does simply because he has the power to do so and this plays into how he is “living in the moment.” By having others fight for their lives, this implies that they believe that their lives are still “worth fighting for.” If one did not care about something or if something was perceived to have no value, why would one fight for it? In this sense, he serves to convince humanity that their lives are “worth something,” even if in actuality, living is pointless. Yoshii can actually be seen as a sort of anti-hero a degree, “saving” humanity by lying and falsely convincing them of the value of life. As a whole, he represents, the “embrace” of nihilism, accepting it, yet finding a way to move “beyond” it. If life has no meaning, then the only way that there can ever “be” meaning is if meaning is somehow inserted into it. By living in the moment and exerting his existence, Yoshii “creates” a “sense of meaning,” even if meaning in its entirety means nothing in itself. 
On the other hand, Ichise is the embodiment of the “will to live.” He persists seemingly without any sort of external goal or ambition, merely living for the sake of living. He is quiet and does not speak a single line of dialogue for the first three episodes of the show. His life does not appear to be a “happy” one, yet he pushes on in spite of it all. It brings up the question of whether people need a cause in order to persist in the first place. Rather, it is not the meaning itself that is required for one to move forward, but simply the internal resolve to do so. Ichise serves to choose a path that Yoshii did not choose. Instead of going out in an explosion of ideals, Ichise chooses to waste away until the inevitable end, simply living until he could live no more. He emphasizes how “little” one really needs to live and become satisfied with the fact that one has lived. In society, “success” in life seems to be derived from one’s “status,” or “wealth,” or “fame” or “accomplishments,” and in turn these things are “supposed” to assist people in being satisfied with their lives. People are “convinced” that all of these things hold merits and in turn, this assists in pushing people to live out their lives. Ichise plays to the contrary of this. He is not rich, nor famous, nor is he of the elite “Class,” yet he still finds self-satisfaction by the end of the series. What Texhnolyze does is “discard the superficial,” serving to be a reminder that EVERYTHING else in life is merely extra. The importance does not lie within whether one’s life “means” anything or not, but rather with the fact that one is satisfied that one has lived at all. His journey kind of corresponds with “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,” initially searching for biological satisfaction before searching for safety and “relationships and a place of belonging,” through the Organo. By being persistent in living and retaining his will to live, he builds his “esteem” and through the acceptance of death and rejection of immortality and meaning, finding only satisfaction in his life as demonstrated by his smile, he finds his “self-actualization and self-transcendence.” One does need an emotionally charged life in order to live. The fact is simply that one has lived, nothing more and nothing less. 
Ichise’s recognition comes with his arrival on the surface, the surface which is even more “hellish” than Lux is, despite being brighter and at first glance having more of what would be considered a “conventional civilization.” The fact here is that humanity on the surface has pretty much reached a means of living forever. However, in the process of doing so, they realize that there is truly no reason to prolong the species existence in the first place. If humanity as a whole died out, so what? Theoretically our extinction would not be able to harm us because we would be dead and nobody would be able to care because once again, they would be dead. We may have nothing to gain by going extinct, but at the same time we have nothing to lose. If all of life’s actions are rendered meaningless in the end, then progression for progression’s sake is also worthless. Lux as a society attempts to transcend its mortality by merging with machines, believing that one can live forever in such a way. The surface, having transcended such through breeding for perfect genes, has come to the conclusion that there is no point to it all and has lost the will to live. Ichise encounters people on the surface, and having recognizing how they have “lost their will to live,” he realizes that “at least the people of Lux are alive.” People have become ""ghosts without shells, only able to look fondly on past memories"" while slowly wasting away. He recognizes that at least the people of Lux still “believe” life to be worth something. Even if it is worth nothing in actuality, it is the “belief” that is the important part. This recognition serves to strengthen his own will to live towards the end, getting up despite being surrounded after Onishi is slaughtered. Of course, once again, he dies in the end, but takes pride in the fact that he still fought to survive in the first place. Life is beautiful “because” of its transience. 
Along these lines comes into play how our lives revolve around convincing ourselves to live. It is easier to die than it is to live and people surround themselves with everything they can in order to push themselves forward. If everyone became like the people on the surface and recognized that life in its entirety had no meaning, society would cease to function. We would simply be moping around waiting for our extinction. Our power, our fame and material possessions and experiences serve to “keep us alive.” They help prevent us from killing ourselves. In order to live, of course, one needs the basic necessities for the most part of “food, water and shelter,” but what is usually left out of the equation entirely is the “will to live.” The will to live is crucial to living. Whatever one does, death will eventually come to wipe it away. In fear of this, people try to become immortal, but realize the same futility in forever preserving one’s existence. Either way is equally “meaningless.” At the same time however, since one is going to die either way, why would one kill themselves? Since the destination is the same, why not do whatever one can with one’s life? One can do so simply because one has the “ability” to do so. This is what it means to “live for the sake of living.” Even if there is no meaning, higher order or purpose to the struggle of life, there does not have to be. People do not need to be chained down by external goals, motivations and ambitions, and the fact of whether one’s life holds meaning in itself is “meaningless.” If nothing has meaning, then the notion of having meaning in itself is also rendered meaningless. It is meaningless to have meaning in one’s life. What is important, once again, is the fact that one has “come to terms with death,” and while fading away, one is satisfied with the fact that one has lived in itself. Just because life means nothing does not mean that one cannot live.  
Texhnolyze touches upon and breaks apart of the concept of meaning in its entirety. Meaning is merely a “steppingstone” to self-satisfaction. Meaning can “help” an individual be satisfied with their life, but it is by no means a requirement to live. The fact of whether one finds meaning in their life is meaningless. If one finds meaning in their life, then cool, but it won’t change the fact that one is going to die. Having meaning in itself is meaningless, but something being meaningless also means nothing. This serves to create a paradox in which meaninglessness means nothing but the fact that it does means nothing at the same time. It is enough to drive a person insane, and in this case, it’s best to discard meaning altogether. The fact that we are thinking about these things are meaningless so why should we think about them. Why would we philosophize and search for the meaning of life if it means nothing in the first place? Once again, meaning is only a steppingstone. So what if thinking about such things means nothing? It does not change whether we can think about it or not. Just like how Ichise does not need meaning to live, humanity does not need meaning to live, or engage in any sort of action. We “can” live for the sake of living. Even if there is no light at the end of the tunnel, the importance lies in the fact that we made it, or at least “tried” to make it to the end of the tunnel. Life does not need to be more than what it is, life. Humanity does not need a grand “reason” for its existence, we merely exist. ""People don't need ""meaning"" to persist in the first place,"" is probably one of the most valuable lessons I've learned because it's pretty much the anti-thesis of reason itself. The idea of meaninglessness is by no means a positive one, but it also means that meaning means nothing in the first place. So what if something means something? Just means that it means nothing. Nothing more, nothing less. The series says to live without looking for meaning because there is no meaning in looking for meaning. Struggle to the end, even if nothing good comes from it. If nothing has a point, then everything is equally important. Don't worry so much about everything and just live your life. Meaning only means as much as someone believes it does. Whether it does or doesn't won't change anything. Life is simply a journey either way.  
These are just some basic things I believe Texhnolyze is trying to say, which is why I hail it as one of the best series I've seen. The series operates on some of the most basic philosophical questions including man's pursuit of a higher state of being, meaning in life and the limits of human evolution and I believe it be true study of humanity as a whole. To me, it is probably the most grounded anime I've seen, literally presenting the two choices life holds, either kill yourself or live until you die, but then the series focuses on how to deal with this fact. It is about retaining the will to live, I've went over that, but it's also so much more at the same time. Life may have no inherent meaning. Life may hold inherent meaning because you decide it does. It doesn't matter though because death awaits and you lose everything. Therefore, meaning means nothing. It nullifies literally EVERYTHING that the entire world teaches. It discards ALL the superficial, its stark presentation representing that. It does not need a complicated scenario, or comedic relief because the point is that nothing means anything, even the point itself. You may enjoy your time living, or you may not, but either way, death awaits. You may have a legacy, but it will eventually be forgotten. Humanity will eventually perish, the solar system, the galaxy, and then the universe and what's beyond. It solves every problem simply because the problems don't mean anything to begin with. Struggle is necessary or else people would become ghosts in empty shells, the struggle itself being part of what keeps people living on. The surface, where people lived peacefully represents the fact that a paradise is a prison, no progress to be made and no incentive to do anything because everyone is comfortable and nothing means anything in the first place. It proposes that nothing means nothing because it's true, but then it states that the fact that nothing means nothing also means nothing. In other words, so what if nothing has a point? The ""so what"" meaning nothing and the point meaning nothing. Nothing having a point means nothing in the first place. It's a paradox in which nothing means nothing, but the fact that it does also means nothing, in turn, nullifying itself. It states, that you do not need meaning or ambition in the first place in order to do something, which is what Ichise did. Living for the sake of living. But what's wrong with that? Nothing means nothing anyway. The redundancy here serves to drill these ideals into your head. Your life means nothing, or you life means something, yet whether it does or does not does not change your fate. We progress, seeking the meaning of life, even if we do know that finding such may not alter the bigger picture of what is to come, simply because it is what we do. As a whole, Texhnolyze serves to be, once again, a breakdown of how “meaning” functions and humanity’s various ways of coping with extinction in its entirety.

    From the same creators of Serial Experiments Lain, Haibane Renmei and Hellsing, this series stands out as a whole, having one of the most complex plots I’ve ever seen, a great and original art style (Abe!), dark color, good opening, ending, OST and a really alternative development. It’s the kind of series that if you don’t actually pay attention and put your brain to work, you’ll end up with a ? stamped on your face.  
There are a lot of little references through the episodes, from books to folklore. One major thing we can mention is how you cannot avoid thinking on Dante’s Commedia when you see the disposition of the status: the upper word (heaven/Hades?) and Lux (the purgatory/hell?), mainly when is mentioned that the inhabitants had the “demon inside”, when Kohagura affirmed that it was probably the ninth circle and when is said: “If this is already hell, where are we going to?” What the hell? Well, you’ll understand when you see. Later on, you’ll think you’re reading Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation. 
About Japanese folklore, references are vast and still not completely know, taking Ueda’s statement into account: “I’d also find it interesting if non-Japanese fans could get a feel for the sensibilities of the show, which are admittedly very Japanese”. The main thing we see is Ran’s fox mask. In Japanese society, the fox is considered to be the guardian deity of farming (rice fields) by some, because the animal eats field mice that often damage or destroy crops. This guardian deity signifies some special power in Gabe, which is an agrarian community as well. Makes sense considering that the white fox is brownish is summer (Ran’s hair) and white in the winter, when we think about hers double personality. Also seems truthful considering last episode Myth, and how the fox is an important part of that, from Aesop to Japan’s folklore. Throughout a millennium of Japanese folklore, the fox is depicted as the epitome of deception, able to transform into any shape or form it strategically desires. Due to its ancient mystique, the fox figures prominently, not only in popular folklore, but also in formal Shinto mythology. Thus, should you walk through the rural forests of contemporary Japan, you will no doubt encounter shrines wholly dedicated to this semi-divine animal. Kitsune (foxes) have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as his messengers (makes sense when we think Ran is a prophet). 
It’s said that the statements in this anime are somewhat vague and virtually elusive, what’s in part true, but is what makes the show unique. The main characters, Ichise and Ran, are really the quiet kind. The first basically can only express himself through rage and the second, due to her powers, is much more a just-watching type. However, both of them, once attached to someone, are really caring – in their own way. Ichise is really loyal to Onishi and Organo, and Ran leaves Rafia flowers to guide the way of the lost ones and likes to hear Gurayama. Ichise had a harsh childhood, losing his parents in violent ways and having to fight with his own fists in order to don’t starve, so his personality is really not that surprising. Ran is a diviner who has problems accepting that what she foresees is real, for is always a dramatic ending, but, since her predictions are always precise, her quiet attitude is almost like an acceptance of her destiny. She reminds me Hinoto and Rika. Therefore, watching this show, don’t expect dialogues “yes or no” and learn to read in between the lines and the little actions – they speak much more than a thousand sentences. Never mind the words: sing! – is what said the gamin to Chaplin’s ingenious performance. Silence is an important factor of the development. 
People the entire time struggle with their own destiny and the meaningless of their existence. Doc, realizing how her study was insignificant, Gabe’s elder, unable to protect the prophet, Shinji, the Freedom’s believer, climbing an inexistent better world… everybody is just trying to carry through, even while realizing the aimless of it all, and is exactly that will to survive that will end up destroying them. 痛い。生きたい。痛い。 
There’s blood and violence for the sadist fans but even at that aspect the series is unique. When Ichise has his arm chop off, you don’t see a lot of gore, instead, you watch his image really distorted and enlarged, a painful expression reinforced by the shadows in his face and red covering the whole image accompanied by -not a loud and annoying scream but - a low and creepy one. A surrealist portrait of pain (and in sequence there’s an allegory with a reptile’s regenerative power). 
(DON’T READ THESE PARAGRAPHS IF YOU HAVEN’T COMPLETED THE SERIES) 
The entire time the human factor is put in comparison with the technology. Ichise all the time asks if “that” is his real hand – the same hard time Chaplin had with the feeding machine. Although his mechanics limbs are the most visible thing, his eyes are almost as important as. Doc took interest on him because of his optics, which were like the ones the original inhabitants had, the woman is the first episode goes crazy in sex because of these “demon’s eyes” and the weird images that appear on the view of the texhnolyzed. Doc is called Ichise’s second mother, referring to the fact that she gave his new body, which even had hers cells on it and welcomes him to this Brave New World (also adding a case of metaphoric incest to the literal one already showed). A bad ass techno by Juno Reactor on the opening, setting up the series’ environment, in contrast with the ending Tsuki no Uta from Gackt: a bland, peaceful and sad song that gives the human element. The flower is traditionally a symbol of hope, what is showed when Ran guides Ichise through the sewer like an Ariadne, and also appears on the ending theme - although the one that accompanies Ran is one that in Japan symbolizes death (death is hope?). We also see the contrast, and complement, between religion and science when a so called modern society has an augur in a so high appreciation. Having Ueda statement in mind, is almost like we’re talking about Japan itself, where one of the great industrialized countries has to deal with the opposites between the new and the traditional.  
Not only about Japan, we can make a parallel between Texhnolyze’s world and the one we live today. For ages we’ve heard how science’s progress will lead us to a better world, a world of peace, how it will extinguish hunger, how death will be defeated and we will have some cool flying cars… what came was more destructive kind of weapons, extension of the line between poor and rich, and we still don’t have the damn flying cars… In texhnolyze’s world prosthesis have reached a point that we still can only dream about, and yet Lux’s dwellers live in extreme poverty and, therefore, that kind of prosthetic device is for few. On the other hand, Surface’s society is so developed that everything is already meaningless. Doc thought that kind of technology was the next step for evolution and, notwithstanding, she discovered it was all a lie, and fainted into emptiness like everybody there. Science development lost its meaning since nobody really gets its allegedly good fruits. Surface people only wait for death, without realizing they already are, their original purpose kept getting further and further until was not there anymore. Lasciate ogni speranza, voi che entrate.  
We could make a parallel with economic issues, technologic issues, political issues and so forth. However, master pieces like this anime transcend exactly because are not attached to any particular theme. In Chaplin’s Modern Times, the first thing that appears is this: “'Modern Times'. A story of industry, of individual enterprise ~ humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness”. It doesn’t matter if is a modern metropolis, a futurist world or a rural society from the seventh century. People are people and is not the advent of a new robot that will change humanity – humans change humans. Lux, Raffia, Organo, Texhnolyze itself are just accessories. The main thing is about people searching for their path. In the end, Ichise says that was Ran that changed him, not his mechanic limbs, and wonders if he was able to change her too.  
Two people that fight against their destiny trying to find their own path - the pursuit of happiness. When Ran body is gone, his mechanical part is able to reproduce the flower- hope- her image- death. And then we see the first, and only, time that this angered and lonely man is able to smile… as everything fades away. 
Smile 
tho' your heart is aching, 
Even though it's breaking, 
When there are clouds in the sky- You'll get by, 
If you 
Smile through your fear and sorrow, 
Smile and maybe tomorrow 
You'll see the sun come shining through- For you. 
Light up your face with gladness, 
Hide ev'ry trace of sadness, 
Altho' a tear may be ever so near, 
That's the time you must keep on trying, 
Smile- What's the use of crying, 
You'll find that life is still worthwhile, 
If you just smile.

    Humans have always been captivated by the idea of reaching a greater purpose. Whether its physical adaptation, or enlightenment through the mysteries of our own mind. Its an arduous journey for either. Within the world of Lux theres a glimpse of both. What you forfeit by the end will depend truly on how deep your willing to look. I would not recommend this as a light or easy watch. This is a show to be viewed multiple times and picked apart due to its immense detail. 
The plot progress’s sequentially giving the story a realistic tone. It follows a linear path using flashbacks and precognition at times for character development. The story flows uniquely as each event follows one after another. Theres no time skips or out of place fillers. Just day an night unfolding in different shapes. Its exhausting to watch yet because of this technique of story telling, the emotion crafted throughout the show creates undeniable believability in the characters and the way they develop within the setting as it changes.  
Vivid and shocking to say the least, the beautiful vista’s shown amongst the fragmental city of Lux, juxtaposed below the haunting Surface World, together they create an allure unmatched in unforgettability. The contrast surrounding Lux and the Surface World is compelling. The way one is struggling to live while the other has lost the will to struggle is a chilling comparison. The animation is filled with symbolism, while presenting a perfect tint for the story, makes it a thrilling watch. 
With a soundtrack diverse and unique its awkward at times. It pushes you away then brings you in effortlessly at just the right moments. This added to the struggle seen throughout the story making it truly engaging. As for the sound from Voice acting and Gunshots, to the dragging of Ichise texhnolyzed leg or Violent incidents. Its always crisp and clear, unless of course is the distorted technolyzed sound which fit perfectly into the tone of the story.  
Your shown the lives of those who strive to find purpose while they wriggle amongst others around them. Though their goals may differ from Understanding yourself, Protecting whats important, Creating preeminent, or Fabricating chaos. They feel real. As the events unfold often out of their control you watch while they strain and attempt to survive while never losing sight of their desires. Its a tragically beautiful story with a wonderfully realistic cast of characters. 
Conclusion If you are open minded, looking for a unique show, that will present you with a elaborate story and leave it up to you to decide how to interpret the events. Texhnolyze will deliver a experience that may change how you separate superlative story telling from the mediocre. 
""You just said that you don't belong to anything, but that's a lie. You belong to this city. Without a doubt, so does your freedom.” Yoshii Kazuho.

    Overview: 
Chiaki Konaka is a very celebrated writer here on MAL and for good reason. Mr. Konaka has consistently proven himself to be among the most challenging, innovative, and important anime writers in the last 25 years. While most people would choose Serial Experiments Lain as his magnum opus, Texhnolyze is actually my favorite Konaka work I've seen so far. 
Firstly, I'm going to issue a little warning. Texhnolyze is not a cheerful series. It isn't a fast paced series. There is no comedy you will find here. There isn't any fanservice and you won't be getting into a ""best girl"" argument. Part of what makes Texhnolyze so admirable is also a point that causes division. The simple fact that this is an uncompromising, oppressively bleak series. After 22 episodes it just leaves you feeling completely drained emotionally. However, I would argue against the people that say Texhnolyze is purely nihilistic in its philosophy. Texhnolyze is more appropriately categorized as an existentialist work that's also a harsh warning against transhumanism and futurism. The hard stance against transhumanism and futurism is something it shares with Serial Experiments Lain, making Tex a sort of spiritual successor to Lain. 
Plot: (contains some world building/background spoilers!) 
At some point in the future, a dystopian system is created. The vast majority of the human population is purged in a massive culling. Some survivors that are considered violent and degenerate are sent to live in a city deep underground, evoking Dante's Hell. The underground city of Lux is controlled by 3 factions: a Mafia group called the Organo, a populist cult called the Salvation Union, and a bunch of rebel punks called Racan. The people who dwell on the surface world give cybernetic appendages to the Organo, so they can use them in combat to keep their position of power. In exchange, the Organo harvest spinal cords and biological material to give to the surface dwellers to use in their cybernetic research and bioengineering. The surface world seems like a utopia at first, but this means that humans have nothing to struggle against or strive for. Without the ability to suffer, the surface dwellers become so apathetic that they just wait around to die. 
The story is mostly told through the eyes of a young man named Ichise. He is an MMA prizefighter whose father was executed for a crime he didn't commit and his mother died in a mining accident. One day, Ichise's boss decides to buy him a prostitute, even though Ichise isn't interested. She gets rough in bed and gouges him the eye, so Ichise throws her out. This is taken as an insult by Ichise's boss, so our hero gets an arm and a leg cut off. Fortunately, a scientist lady known as ""Doc"" manages to find Ichise and give him cyborg limbs. She's affiliated with the Organo and now so is Ichise...not like he has anything better to do. In another sub-plot, a surface dweller named Yoshi sees the malaise that ""utopia"" created and decides to create as much chaos as he can because he believes that's the environment humans best thrive in. 
Later in the plot we get a lot of mafia power struggles and a new villain named Kano...who tragically doesn't have a heavy Australian accent in the dub. Kano believes Free Will is a mistake and humans would be better off as mindless robots. He invades Lux with his robot army and takes over from Yoshi as the chief antagonist in part 2 of the series. 
Chararacters: 
Our main character is Ichise, but he's more of a guide for the viewer than he is a traditional ""hero"". Ichise is so broken emotionally, spiritually, and otherwise that he has become quite animalistic. He generally does what he's told and lacks any kind of direction in life. He typically gives in to blind, rabid rage rather than acting on logic. He is a man stripped of everything beside his essential instinct for survival. While Doc is sexually attracted to Ichise, he never seems to return her feelings. The closest thing to an intimate, human relationship that Ichise has is his friendship with an openly gay mafioso named Toyama. This has of course led to questions about Ichise's sexuality, but Texhnolyze is as vague here as it is in most places. I will say though that in episode 12, Toyama leans over to whisper something sensually in his ear. Then the scene cuts directly to a shot of a train entering a tunnel. Draw your own conclusions. 
Onishi is the honorable gangster who might actually be the most moral person in this series. As a child, he felt bad for another kid who was born without legs and donated his own as an act of pure charity. Onishi realizes that Lux is an awful place, but he clings on to the fact that people are still trying to find happiness and live their lives. For that reason he will protect Lux at all costs and defend it from Yoshi's chaos and Kano's robots. Onishi will use violence when absolutely neccesary, but he is generally hesitant to do so. He also places strong emphasis on loyalty and family. 
Yoshi is probably Texhnolyze's most iconic character. He does evil things and feels no pity for those he kills, but his reasons are understandable. He grew up in a civilization that faces apathetic, slow extinction because it denied people the ability to suffer. Dostoevsky wrote in Notes From Underground that suffering is the sole origin of human consciousness. His comrade in early existentialist thought, Friedrich Nietzsche, wrote that ""to live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in that suffering"". Despite being a complete sociopath, Yoshi is almost sympathetic in his actions. 
Finally, we have the 2 transhumanists Doc and Kano, which are 2 sides of the same coin. Doc believes that making people into cyborgs will allow humanity to escape from its primal and violent nature. However, increased technology doesn't always lead to less violence because human nature remains unchanged. Konaka's rejection of transhumanism is based on his belief that human nature is essentially immutable. Humans are fundamentally irrational creatures that by their very nature are capable of being cruel, violent, and hateful. No amount of technology and new gadgets are going to change that. Kano is FAR more pessimistic than Doc and is easily the most Nihislitic character in the series. Kano hates essentially everything about Mankind and feels that allowing humans to have free will can only result in destruction and grief. ""Nothing has ever been more insufferable for Man than freedom! Not even that Fosters piss the yanks drink!"" Nope, I won't let it go that he shares a name with a goofy Mortal Kombat villain. Texhnolyze doesn't have any fun, so it's neccesary I create my own! 
Themes: 
As I mentioned in my character analysis, Texhnolyze's key themes relate to human nature. Firstly, humans have an absolute need to suffer and strive for improvement. A perfect utopia would paradoxically become Hell to its human inhabitants. Secondly, Konaka warns that transhumanism and futurism ignore human nature and erroneosly believe that increased technology will lead to decreased violence and increased happiness. Lastly, Texhnolyze shows that no matter how awful life becomes, humans will learn to adapt to that suffering and keep desiring to live. ""Man is a creature that can get accustomed to anything, and I think that is the best definition of him"".  
The art by Studio Madhouse is spectacular and I'm beginning to grow tired of having to say that sentence. Madhouse just knocks it out of the park again and again...which is why I enjoyed reviewing Junk Boy just so I could finally shit on them. The character art was done by Konaka's longtime friend Abe, who of course also did the character art for Lain and his own series Haibane Renmei. The only issue with Texhnolyze's art is that the color palette is SO dark. It makes it very difficult to watch if you're viewing it on a pirate streaming site like Kissanime or Animefreak. There are scenes where I could barely tell what was happening. Since it's no longer on any legal streaming sites, I recommend getting the DVD if you can afford it. 
Apart from a kickass intro, Texhnolyze has a fairly minimalist soundtrack. That's because this is a highly atmospheric series with a lot of long pauses. If music was playing all the time it would only take away from the mood. 
Texhnolyze is good. Texhnolyze is VERY good. The online elitists aren't just pulling your leg this time. However, it does suffer from a fairly slow start and later becomes SO emotionally draining that it's hard to watch for many viewers. As a result, I can't quite recommend this one for everyone. I think most of my offline anime buddies would dislike this more than they disliked Lain. If you're a fan of Lain though, this series is essential viewing. Personally, I got a lot out of Texhnolyze and I'm very glad I finally gave it a chance. Now I want to watch something just a wee bit less depressing...maybe I'll check out Aria if the whiplash doesn't kill me.

    Texhnolyze is an adult show. 
You may happen to witness homosexuality, SM, pedophilia,incest, blood sheds, meaningless violence and utter despair while watching it. 
This is a pitch black cyber-punk tale of High Quality -Abe Yoshitoshi- in all regards : entrancing music, beautyfull art, bright direction and mind-blowing plot. 
The pacing is slow, and the naration often resorts to visual communication and minimalist dialogues as you follow the taciturn (yet so hot) Ichise in the turmoil-city of Lux. You have to think of it as a highly symbolic and esthetic tale questioning civilisation, progress, evolution, survival, violence, loneliness and their conflicts with morality and sanity. 
Story: Due to the slow, unusual story-telling and somewhat symbolic plot, the show sometimes fails to keep your mind plugged. However, the directing is really top notch: centerings, lightings, designs are some of the best i ever seen in an anime, period. 
Sound: An opening with no karaoke is just pure win, plus it's trans-what else? The sound track fits the dark-industrial-cyberpunk mood very well, with some strings here and there and a heart-breaking song for the last episode. 
Characters: Oonishi the King, Ishise the Fighter, Eriko the Artist, Ran the Virgin, Yoshii the Stranger... each of them are strong symbolic figures with deep and complex psychologies, motives and desires.  
Enjoyment: I won't say this show is a masterpiece, but it is so refreshing, ambitious and wiked that the flaws are easyly forgiven. I did not had a really fun time watching it, it is indeed pretty violent and utterly depressing -this is no entertainment. Nonetheless, the show is apart (and far far better) from your daily anime, and it truely deserves some attention and praise.

    I’ve been meaning to describe my experience with Texhnolyze since I last rewatched it, but just like the ending to the show I found myself a bit lost for words and a little empty inside. I’ve since found that it’s very easy to write about things I don’t like in anime, but it’s difficult for me to give praise to fantastic shows in a way that gives them the respect they deserve. 
Story - 10/10 
Texhnolyze's story stands out because of the power of its narrative. The story of the Texhnolyzed Ichise is not one that progresses very rapidly, but the complexities of the world of Lux and its counterparts, the inhabitants and their allegiances, as well as the external forces that bring change to the city are all dealt with in full length, providing the viewer by the end of the show a wide and deep understanding of the world of Texhnolyze.  
That being said, Texhnolyze shows way more than it tells, and while it's minimalist dialogue and slow pacing may be a turn off to viewers who were expecting fast action based off of the opening, to me it's a great change of pace and very fitting for the dark material that it covers.  
As a result, Texhnolyze doesn't spoon feed you information, but instead tries to convey its story more stylistically through the use of different colors, drawings, scene construction, character expressions, and symbolism. And I think it does very well. The show is multi-layered, with religious, artistic, and literary references that enhances the show's already powerful messages but not so overwhelming that you're lost in an incomprehensible mess. 
The themes of Texhnolyze are also thought provoking. From traditional cyber punk themes of the fusion of man and machine and the negative impacts of technology or post apocalyptic messages ranging from the fall of man to the meaningless of life, Texhnolyze gives the viewer a lot to think about when the credits rolls at the end, and it leaves up a lot to interpretation to the point where as dark as it is, Texhnolyze still offers a bit of hope at the end of the tunnel. 
Art - 9/10 
The art of Texhnolyze really does deserve a ten, and my giving it a nine is more of a personal snicker than anything else. The show's set pieces are very fitting for its content. There are few shows where the expression of a character's face or a camera angle or the depiction of certain buildings adds value and importance to the story. Whether it's the haunting perspective of Ichise where his view is now covered with details about his new robotic limbs or the apathetic expression from the show's deadly instigator, Texhnolyze offers up a lot of fine detail to analyze. 
Texhnolyze manages to do that and more. While the majority of Lux is bound in grey and other colors that have been shaded with darker hues, the use of lighting is used very effectively when it comes to important and critical scenes or used thematically as a means of splitting characters in light or dark. In short, Texhnolyze uses all forms of visual storytelling to improve upon its already powerful story. 
My only gripe with the show is that its cover art is kind of misleading. Ichise, Ran, Onishi, and Motoharu, some of the main characters in the story, are nowhere near as sexy (and for Ran...well she's still kind of cute) as they are in the cover art. Which made me sad. :( 
Sound - 10/10 
The opening and ending of the show are really interesting and I think they kind of set the pace for the show in a very noticeable way too, getting our bloods pumping by the beginning of the show and then gradually calming us down by the end with a peaceful melody by Gackt. Juno Reactor's Guardian Angel is splendid and I can't think of any better way to have opened the anime. 
Its soundtrack is also a diverse mix of slow piano pieces, guitar solos, fast more trance/techno beats, and even the occasional rap. One wonders when listening to Texhnolyze's soundtracks how such a violent and depressing anime could have uplifting tracks, and I think that's one of the qualities of Texhnolyze.  
But beyond the sounds, one must realize that Texhnolyze is still a very sensory experience. Just like how the art was used in a way to highlight characters, sound is used pretty extensively as a means of conveying the narrative. The ragged breaths of Ichise as his anger rises up and down, the soft sound of footsteps at a suspenseful moment, the sound of trains, gunfire , shifting of the legs, all these sounds are amplified and brought out in a way that creates such an intense atmosphere that wouldn't have existed with such good sound editing. 
Character - 10/10 
The characters in Texhnolyze are deeply flawed, but that's all part of their charm. I've heard many people say that they couldn't get emotionally attached to these characters, and while I disagree, I think that's still missing the point.  
I'm not a big fan of the phrase ""I'm in this show for the characters"" because that implies an attachment to certain characters than a show might or might not really need to succeed. There are plenty fans of Eva who find characters like Shinji or Asuka or Rei revolting and still love the show for what it is. The same can be said with a show like Ergo Proxy (and that's not the only thing asinine about that show).  
I happened to love the characters but even so, Texhnolyze offers up very human characters that all have plenty of development and screen time. We understand their motives, their philosophies, and they all add something important to the narrative. Whether it's Doc and her attempts at bridging the world of man and machine or Onishi with his steadfast sanity that kept the city from falling into utter chaos or Yoshii with an apathy that I have never seen since reading The Stranger, all of these characters have great characterization. 
Enjoyment - 10/10 
Texhnolyze is not a show for everyone. It's violent, slow, and almost downright depressing. It's also not a show where people just sit down and expect a fun experience. It's thought provoking and tries to create a narrative that's multi-layered and deep, and it definitely succeeds. It just happens to frighten away a good proportion of the anime fanbase in the process. 
I personally thought that Texhnolyze was an intensely enjoyable experience. Every episode was filled with such great world building, characterization, atmosphere, and sometimes even action to admire and think about. I left every episode thinking about something new, and Texhnolyze was enough of an interesting take on cyberpunk that I would say that I came out kind of enlightened and thought about the genre in a different light. 
The fact that a lot of the show was up to interpretation was also interesting. Plenty of friends cite how bleak it is, but I happen to think Texhnolyze has some uplifting moments. It offers up that mankind, even down in its darkest moments, is constantly fighting for survival, to live, to find one's meaning in life. It offers that while technology may be a bane on existence, perhaps there's something else there, that it helps us forge bonds or become more human than we were. Texhnolyze has these kinds of themes and messages for us, lying in wait. One just has to look for them to understand and enjoy what the show has to offer. 
Overall, Texhnolyze is easily one of the best, if not the best, anime I have ever seen. I think I've found the words I've been meaning to say for a long time.  
Texhnolyze is not for everyone, but if one is an anime fan, I highly recommend you give it a shot.

    Texhnolyze is a show about heavy breathing, grunting, and a pissing contest between a group of gun and sword wielding alpha males in suits who speak in bad mob movie cliches. If you force your imagination enough, you may be able to find something deep in the recesses of this art, but the same could be done if you stared long enough at the textures on a rusty frying pan. 
There's a subplot about ""texhnolyzation"", a procedure to repair or upgrade a person using technologies such as mechanical limbs. The transhumanist ideas herein, which have potential, are unfortunately enveloped in a lot of empty atmosphere. Most scenes are comprised of long shots of nothing, sound effects that were ran through one too many flange filters, and cryptic dialog that's just later reiterated in dull exposition. 
The tone is reminiscent of the cheap drawings an angry teenager would sketch up after being sent to his room for cursing out his mother. There's hardly any diversity among the characters; they all share the same stern facial expression, and communicate by either mumbling or shouting. 
Episodes 19 - 22, though still reliant on exposition, are admittedly fascinating as they focus on the aforementioned subplot. With that said, I'm not entirely sure the ending was worth sitting through the preceding 6 hours of tedium. If this show had been around 10 episodes instead of 22, it could have been good, maybe even great.

    Okay, I'm going to repeat what many others have said and state that Texhnolyze is NOT a series for everyone. The pace is slow and punishing, and if your main squeeze is the straightforward action side of anime you will probably hate this. 
However rather than bore me, I personally found the pace to be a breath of fresh air. This slow and steady treatment of the story is more realistic and true-to-life for me, and while it might not be as instantly gratifying as some other series it's truly enveloping and convincing. The plot itself is highly complex, and as with Lain, Texhnolyze's spiritual predecessor, you probably won't be able to take it all in with one viewing. 
The art is beautiful and highly atmospheric. The world of Lux springs to life with many lush, yet dark and gloomy settings. The characters are soft spoken but oddly compelling, especially in the case of Ichise. They're also weirdly real. The cast of Texhnolyze is one of the more believably human ensembles I've ever seen in an anime, and it's difficult not to become attached to them. 
Another point I'd like to bring up is the weird disconnect it establishes between the events that happen on screen and the viewer. Right from the getgo the perspective seems grimly neutral. Texhnolyze isn't telling you how to feel about what's happening, just presenting what happens and letting you make the call. The realistic presentation and attention to detail add to this sensation. It's almost as if the story was told from the point of view of the mysterious city itself. 
Between the realistic pacing, heady plot, and gorgeous settings, Texhnolyze was one of those rare anime that, for me, made everything else seem not quite as good. I don't give out 10s easily but if that doesn't earn one I don't know what does. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a contemplative, challenging series.

    Xam'd: Lost Memories 
Overview 
Akiyuki Takehara is a high school boy, whose biggest problems are his seperated parents, and his constant tardiness.  One day as he is, as usual, running late for the bus he comes in contact with a strange white haired girl who is trying to get onto the bus to the main city on Sentain Island.  Akiyuki helps the girl get on the bus, however it was that decision which would change his life forever.  Unknowingly to Akiyuki the girl detonates a strange devise and bestows a power upon him which is unlike anything else.  Unable to come to terms with this power, and loosing himself in the process Akiyuki has to find his new path in life as an Xam’d. 
Xam’d: Lost Memories is a compelling story which engroses the watcher in a constant barrage of science fiction, war, romance, and drama.  Though a large aray of elements present the series does an exquisit job of seemlessly blending them together for a Very Good series, however in my opinion not magnificent. 
The plot is steady and constantly adjusting as the series progresses.  As the hero becomes more aware of what Xam’d is his journey in life begins to change, and you are dragged along for the action packed ride.  I felt that the writing and the directing were marvelously done allowing the watcher to become fully emersed in this great story. 
The art was craftly exquisite from the futuristic sci fi vehicles, to the transformations, from the action packed fighting sequences, to the beautiful scenery and lighting.  I would have to say that it was graphically astounding from an anime standpoint.  I would of like to have seen a little bit of originality from the artist, though this being a more action, drama, romance series it probably would of felt a bit out of place so in this instance I think the artists went the right direction. 
The characters were each unique and never lost themselves or their characters.  Each character was well written and played key roles in the unfolding of the mysteries of the Xam’d, and as Akiyuki progresses forward in his journey so does everyone else along with him in their own ways.  I do have to say however that in the english sub version their were a few characters that were very hard to even listen to as they acted out their lines, the emotion in their voices often not matching the feel of the scene or just general poor delivery of lines. 
I was very entertained by this series and as mentioned above it performed very well by my main tenants of judging anime.  I would also like to say that the opening credits song must be one of, if not THE, best that I have come across so far.  Despite some few misses with me, that being, originality of artwork and poor voice overs, I still rate this very high. 
Score: 8/10

    Sannova bitch. I’ve been waiting to say that since i first heard the characters name. Now i’ve got that incredibly out of place pun out of the way i can continue. 
Xam’d felt like a cross between Eureka 7, Fractale, Rahxephon and Heroman. Now with that many cross betweens i would think it could give it an air of originality about it but i never really felt like i hadn’t seen it before. Felt? Did i just say felt? Damn, i always hate that expression, like i could touch it or something. Anyway. The story is of this kid who turns into this thing but is some what saved by this person who belongs to this crew and this kid and this person get to fight quite a bit and a lot of morals get thrown about. It really was quite good though. It also appears to have a fantastic setting but everyone seems to have Japanese names. Not sure if i missed something about it being a future world. I don’t think i did. 
What i quite liked about this show was it’s blend of genre. It was at the base of all things; Action adventure. That didn’t stop it from delving into fantasy, sci fi, romance and drama. Particulaly the romance was played quite well in my opinion. It was never mushy or really vague, it was just there. It also focused a little on other peoples romances like the protagonists parents and that female captain who doesn’t wear very much. 
Art was nice. Yes nice, just nice. Not amazing or anything. The animation however was amazing. While the art was simple and very standard it did give variety to the creatures and buildings etc. This probably helped the animation move better. Everyone moved smoothly and made the fight scenes a whole lot nicer to watch. That is all i have to say about the art. Damn my note taking, why did i not focus on the art? Now i have to uses these few sentances to pad the paragraph out to make it look longer. What? Don’t judge me. 
The opening and ending songs were honestly not that great. They were a little different from the jpop you would usually get, the opening using autotune or something on the voices. They were both in English too. The opening also had a weird choice of lyrics that did not make sense to me for the most part, might because it was Engrish rather than proper English. The ending however was slightly better sung. Well it would be, it was sung by a person whose mother tongue is English. Now these to theme songs were mediocre at best. The background music was however far better. I will be honest, i didn’t notice the musc during the first two thirds. It probably just never stood out to me. However during the end few episode it did stand out and episode 23 in particular had a really nice orchestral piece playing and it made the scene far nicer. 
I watched this mostly in the dubbed English and though i won’t put it up there with the Baccano’s of dubbed anime. It did seem well acted, the two sister being voiced by my favorite voice actresses. 
Characters were cool. I guess. There were a few that annoyed me like the red head who tried to save everyone. But overall they all had the ups and they all had there flaws and these flaws gave them character. ‘Gave them character’ that doesn’t sound right. Oh well, i’ll leave it in. All the important characters seemed to change as they grew with the show. The protags (my new name for the main character of shows now) paraents started of disliking each other, mostly on the Mothers part, but came together through tribulations to show they really did love each other. That may be a spoiler. Doesn’t matter, i was lying anyway… Yea.. i was.. err. lying. Oh i should also probably mention there are a few bratty kids in this show, so if they annoy you like they do me you might want to have something in the room with you to punch everytime they speak. It would have helped me if i did. 
Now a quick aggregation. It has a fairly confusing plot that if you don’t want to watch a second time you should really pay attention the first time. The characters are the best part of the show. I liked them all. Well apart frome that guy and that guy. Oh and that person and the thing and that other guy. But mostly they were enjoyable. Sound is amazing. Well the opening less so but the rest was amazing. Now as a summation for my aggregation; There is a reason why i didn’t mention a single persons name. 
Good show. Go watch it.

    This show had great potential, but half way through the series the story got lost. They had so much they needed to explain and ignored it all. They tried to focus on character development, but somewhere along the way decided they didn't know what to do with the characters as well. So, despite an enthralling beginning to an anime making me want to keep watching I lost steam half way and just finished it to finish it. The ending made no logical sense and I was a little frustrated by some of the story elements not being properly explained. 
Despite the lackluster ending, its worth watching. The characters are quite brilliant, they just need another season or a few more episodes to fill out and be complete.

    So this is my first review ever, so I'll do the best job that I can. Firstly I'd like to start off with the fact that there have been only a handful of anime series that have ever actually pulled me into the story on a personal level. Xam'd was definitely one of those series. And after watching this series 3 times, I am confident to say that this is my favorite anime series of all time hands down. 
Now, I'll break this anime down into sections and talk about each section: 
STORY: 10/10 
The story for Xam'd: Lost Memories is absolutely unique. And as I have said already, it is my favorite anime series due to the originality of the plot. I also noticed while watching this show that this series could be made out to have subliminal political messages. I also had a feeling that the writer of the script was definitely implying that Sentan Island as North/South Korea. 
ART: 10/10 
Once again, the creators of this series blew me away with the art. The art in this series is THE best I have ever seen, plain and simple. You could tell that the animation studio responsible for making this work of art really didn't care about spending extra money to make this series look better. The animation throughout the whole series was very fluid and very nice. 
SOUND: 9/10 
Overall the sound was very well done but there were a few parts that kind of stood out as 'iffy'. But then again, it's not easy to get the right sound for a human transforming into a Xam'd ;]. 
CHARACTER: 8/10 
Ok, here is where Xam'd got a little sloppy. In the beginning of the series, only a few characters were focused on, but towards the middle, a new set of characters were focused on and back towards the end, the first set of characters were focused on again. This kind of threw me off and made it difficult to understand the first time watching this series. 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10 
'Nuff said. 
OVERALL: 9/10 
With the amazing quality of this series I recommend it to anyone. Wether you are a fan of Romance or Action, this series has it all.

    This show holds all its cards until the end, which is something i really like in any show, 
but i think the pacing was way off. 
it pretty much starts off a slice of life, if you can believe that after the first episode, and continues that way for over half the series.   
I usually do not like slice of life shows, at all, but the characters are just so solid and interesting. 
My gripe with the characters were that the were just under developed and didn't get enough screen time imo.  and that's a little strange considering how long this anime deals with them, which comes down to pacing.   
by and large its a great show, with a above average ending...for some (me).  but the resolution(s) in fact leave a lot more to be desired.  and ofc there are some zombies at the end which will leave you scratching your head.  if the series had 50 episodes, i feel like i probably wouldn't have liked it as well, but it would have done it far more justice in the end.  overall very good watch for fans of pretty much any genre, 
you see from my list what i like and don't like.  its really genre breaking

    Xam'd is a character drama that takes place in a war torn nation. The story follows a series of characters as they adventure through the battle ravaged lands of the warring North and South. From the awkward love triangle between Furuichi, Haru and Akiyuki to the fun crew of a rebellious postal ship and even the evil machinations of military scientists, the show has a lot of flavors going.  
All of this occurs in a quite interesting world where weapons range from flying robots to strange biological abominations. However while the setting and characters in it are all very interesting and well done, little is done to explain the actual mechanisms driving the world at large. Why is there a war, who's on a what side and why do things work the way they do is never fully explored. 
This was the only weakness I could really point out in the show. And I can't truthfully say I miss the episode or two of pure exposition required by other similar shows to explain their world's internal workings. However it would be nice for some of the larger themes, like the cause of the war, to have been fleshed out more. 
Beyond character and story, the show is one of the best examples of the anime form I have ever watched. The art and sound are perfection incarnate. The heated moments of battles, transformations and such are as invigorating as the more emotional moments of conversation, reflection and exploration. The soundtrack adds to the visual feast with a haunting score and some great poppy tunes for opening and closing credits. 
All in all, if you want a gorgeous show with great character drama and heart-pounding action, watch Xam'd. If you're the kind of viewer that requires everything to be thoroughly explained and enumerated to you so you can immerse yourself in a show, don't expect much of Xam'd.

    Like Eureka Seven and Nausicaa put into one! All in all the show had a different type of storyline with diverse characters - though they all have moments where you want to smack them around. The series had a good start, then got little a slow middle, and then had a moderate wrap up - but I would still recommend it. The animation was clean and pretty (because it's Bones of course!). It was interesting that this series came out on the US Playstation network before it was released to Japan.

    The feel of Bounen no Xamdou is very close to that of Eureka Seven.  The war that encompasses the world instigates the journey that the main characters embark on.  The main characters are followed as they each endure the obstacles and horrors of war. 
This show is very story focused.  The story is conveyed very smoothly and it can feel a bit slow even when it is flowing rapidly.  This indicates the grace with which the story is conveyed. It is seldom that a story can be told without a hitch, but the minimization of it is evident through the lack of strain in understanding much of the content in this show. 
This story follows characters that ultimately have great impact on the engulfing war which has diversely impacted each character.  Some characters show little change, displaying their great vitality. Other characters undergo various hardships of unbearable magnitude and struggle to maintain themselves. 
Despite what was well done, the development of the relationships of the main characters could have used some improvement. 
The artwork in this show is spectacular. The fight sequences are not of great focus, but they are portrayed with a natural flow to them.  The character designs are far above average.  Some of the colors in the artwork as well as some of the character designs are reminiscent Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender.   
The beauty of the music in this show is far beyond that of most shows out there. The music manages to guide the viewer through this story with ease, despite its complexities.  Even the opening and ending theme sings are great. I watched through the ending theme after most episodes despite how rare that is for me. 
The English dub cast for this show is fantastic.  The script conveyed the same information as the subs.  Besides the great voice actors of the main characters, some of my favorite voice actors played supporting roles. 
This show manages to provide enjoyment in many diverse ways.  This variety is the source of the greatness of this show.  The many characters that Akiyuki meets are perhaps the best contribution that he makes to the show.  The merging and branching off of stories really makes this show something more than much most. 
As long as you pay attention, this is a very full and complete series.  If something seems confusing (such as the end), then you missed something.  Reading between the lines can make this and so many other shows so enjoyable.

    ""Do not forget who you are"" 
In a world that the south and the north at conflict the ones who suffer the most as always are the civilians. Sentan Island where our mc is located where everthing is beautiful, it never heard or felt war, when the gears of the destiniy starts to revolve nothing stays the same, some will change for the better, some will perish... 
Our MC Akiyuki by some white haired girl named Nazuna recieves Hiroko or Xam'd in a terrorist attack and then forced to live a life that is away from his family and the love of his life -helluva girl- Haru. He needs to understand the will of Hiroko (sometype of symbiote, weapon -has its own intelligence-will if not acted along its will then petrifies the host, though if one is able to achive harmony with it one gains immense power) to be able to live, otherwise forgetting himself and turning into stone. But doing this alone is nearly impossible, to his fortune a Tessician girl, the cloud rider, Nakiami comes to his help, saving him from turning into stone. Akiyuki's long and confusing travel begins with Nakiami and the crew of Zanbani (a postal airship). 
Story: A good grasping story that is able to make you empathize with the world (A Bones Production). Well it is a good story but it has flaws, the concept behind the Xam'd and the world (why the south and the north are fighting) are not explained in detail, also while Akiyuki is the MC the story focuses more on Nakiami later in the anime. There is also no information about the Tessik tribe that Nakiami belongs to, they are excluded, looked down upon by everyone while no solid reason is given to the audience, we only know that they lost their homeland. (it needed more episodes to expand, there are cool ideas in it but never explored) 
Art: Even though it is a 2008 made anime it still shines like a gem.   
Sound: The opening and the ending themes are very very good, the ost in anime are very well made and placed in the anime. 
Character: There are 4 main characters: Akiyuki, Haru, Furuichi, Nakiami. Everyone of them has their own unique and annoying personalities. Akiyuki is a stupid, dense man, though he is astonishingly confident and can take control of the things that goes around him (to some degree). Haru, beautiful, confident, helluva girl, a girl that can muster up courage to find Akiyuki despite the hardness of the task, a girl that does not give up and actually waits (you ll understand after watching). Furuichi, annoying glasses, you will hate him in the begining though you will understand his reasoning in middle of the anime. Nakiami, a beautiful girl who can take care of herself and has a great knowledge about Hirokos, also serves at Zanbani as some kind of a spotter. (these are just little points) 
Enjoyment: It is a well made series, though a llttle bit slow paced -sometimes leaving the MC's story and telling another characters story will make you frustrated since you are left there hanging, waiting to learn what happened to MC-  
Overall: If not watched, should be watched -though not asap, if you have time it is recommended that you give this a try

    Ay yi yi, what a mess. A good mess - but a mess nonetheless. 
Story 5/10 
Art 9/10 
Sound 8/10 
Character 5/10 
Enjoyment 7/10 
The art and sound are decent enough. The storyline was very confusing! It reminded me of Eureka 7, and it should, since it's by the same studio. Like Eureka 7 I only figured out what the heck was going on after sleeping on it. Frankly, I think a lot of viewers will leave this anime feeling unsatisfied because the ending seems like one big Deus Ex Machina. It's not, but it sure feels that way. It is not AT ALL obvious how the big bad is defeated (or even if it does get defeated), neither is it clear what happened to several of the main characters. Even once I figured it out it still wasn't interesting. They tried to come up with something unique but just made it confusing instead. I knew something was wrong when during episode 23 I found myself hoping it was almost over. 
The whole anime has decent art but the ending has above-average production values, evoking the animation prowess of Naruto, OPM, and Bleach, among others. The Xamdou are particularly well-animated, though it appears they only ever rendered the main character's transformation once. This won't bother you sailor moon fans out there, but everyone else will notice the copy-paste transformation. 
Unfortunately, the characters are just awful. Don't get me wrong - they're very animated, lively, and they have strong personalities. The reason I didn't like the characterization is because much of the plot is pushed forward simply based on the fact someone didn't open their damn mouth and say something. In fact, several main characters' personalities and life situations are based around dealing with this, which makes this anime's fundamental disconnect with the viewer all the more ironic. That the titular Xamdou seem to give nearly everyone a depressive complex doesn't help at all. It's like ""oh, there's a problem, *mumble mumble*"" and then something blows up because they didn't get off their ass. 
Overall, the anime is extremely well-done and fun to watch. Just don't expect a feeling of satisfaction when it's over.

    Story (8/10): 
You will definitely get confused at the beginning. It introduces you to a world at war but you have no idea who is fighting and why, you don't know who is good and who is evil. Factions are a mess and no clear enemy 
little by little and as the story progresses and more info is revealed you will get a basic understanding on what is going on (although some stuff will still be a little confusing) 
The story is that of journey that is about finding purpose for some characters, and fulfilling purpose for other characters, and finding truths for other characters. 
One thing for sure is that this is the kind of anime that you should be really patient with. If you get dishearten by the earlier confusion you will drop it without finding out what is really going on. 
Characters (8/10): 
Other that two of the characters in this anime all the other characters have some hidden past or agenda that drives them and it was really interesting figuring out what that past or agenda is as the anime progresses 
Most characters were interesting but you still got standard and by the book characters most of the time 
The MC will start as someone who is driven by the situation and other characters without any self thought but then will turn that around to do things out of his own volition  
Art and Animation (10/10): 
The art was great. Scenes were beautiful and designs were unique. Lots of different environment were shown throughout the anime and all were well drawn and really colorful. Character design was also great 
The animation was top notch starting with characters animation that really made them seem alive from simple gestures to walking and running that felt really natural. Fighting scenes were fluid and well executed and gave an intense feeling and they mad good use of the ""Playdough Effect"" 
It had some reused scenes but I still give it a progress 
Music & VA (8/10): 
Nice OST all around music the music suited the situation most of the time. The OP was really exciting and motivational, the kind that actually draws you in and makes you watch the anime. The ED was nice as well 
I watched the Dub for this anime, it was well made although some characters laked emotions in their voice acting at some point during the anime  
Effectiveness (8/10): 
The anime was all about the journey and should never be watched as an action anime even though it got some really good action. focusing on the story and events to actually understand what the fuck is going on is the best way to actually get everything this anime had to offer 
even if the confusion scares you away the visuals as a major draw point will keep you watching imo 
Overall (8.5/10)

    Unlike FLCL, X;amd takes you to the far beyond in story-telling, but just cannot deliver you back from the senseless fillings, that this journey entailed 
The major flaw of this anime, is its inability to explain itself in its rather unusual setting, that gives a reason to question the viability of founding this setting in the first place 
With outstanding environmental display, you're thrown at nations at war, this warring however enthralling, is not explained, nor is everything else based on the background story for that matter (the northern tribes, the experiments, the xamds!!), and although you get a major HINT -and notice I said hint, not an explanation- in the later episodes, you're still going to leave this show with too many question marks unanswered   
North vs South, captivating story-telling, awesome screenplay action, brilliant artwork, engaging characters, you name it, you have it all here .. 
but all this is the one good side of Xamd 
You get to love the anime, its environment, its art, its reality-striking splice of life drama, its unusual setting ... but right about here it stops 
I will not go on and on about the characters, and who they are, and how they are interpreted, because no matter how you look at it, these subjects are as it is implied - subjective, and solely based on human interactions, what I will rant about is how frustrating I was when it got to the end 
If you're one of those analytic freaks out there where everything to you (or at least a good sum of it) needs to make sense or it all falls down, then unfortunately this show is not for you 
and unlike FLCL, there are no outer sources through which one can draw more background or sense to the deep dark secrets that led to the foundation of the setting of Xamd, or help in deciphering its core, ( no Manga, only one untranslated ), there are simply too many questions left unanswered, so 
without going on and on about what they are, I will stop, so I won't spoil it for anyone 
so the conclusion is this, if you're into a good show with GOOD drama, GOOD character-interactions and development, simulating-reality splice of life thrown in for a good measure, and won't mind the unforgiving plot twists and obscured sub-plots that leads to one of the most paradoxical endings in anime history, then by all means give it a shot, I did and I enjoyed it, although not fully because I myself fall under the other category which favors analytic approach to whatever story made for a good enough show

    Xam'd is a fantasy series with mecha elements. The series is however less of an action title and more of a character driven drama. The plot is a fairly overused one in anime: 1. guy gets power, 2. trains that power, 3. uses that power for good. The story unfolds in a cliche manner as well. The guy with the power ends up in the hands of a crew with starkly different extreme personalities (for 'humor'). As a fantasy series this show falls short as the the supernatural elements are not explained very well despite 26 episodes to do so, but they do hold some originality. The series is thankfully consistent with no weak or out of place episodes.  
Luckily for us, the characters are all 3D with solid profiles.  Not only do we learn in sufficient detail the back-stories and personalities of the major characters, but we get to see the characters change, hurt, strengthen etc.  
Characters meet consequences for following both their heart and their minds. These consequences are perhaps of equal magnitude causing some serious inner turmoil. Most anime simply reward blind heroic actions and punish those that are thought-out. There are a surprising number of deep characters in the supporting cast, I just wish that the personalities of the crew in particular felt a little more realistic.  
The artwork for this series is fairly above average as the colors and character designs were diverse and vibrant. I loved everything from the hairstyles to the clothes they created for each character. The backgrounds were beautiful with a perfect mix of landscapes from barren to urban. One qualm that I had with the artwork was the designs of the enemies as they were fairly repetitive.  
The animation was very fluid and particularly exceptional during fight scenes. The battles cover large amount of ground and convey the speed and power of the Xam’ds (bio-mechs) exceptionally. The only problem that I had was that the fight scenes lacked the choreography to be great despite the nice animation. It was more or less a swinging of a sword arm or an energy beam shot met with a dodge.  The major battles were more or less a way of getting individuals to talk with one another which worked well for the series, so I’m fine with this lacking. 
Overall Reaction: 
This series packs so much character evolution and perseverance into a safe and primitive plot structure.  It is a shame that they did not just run with the more original aspects of the story while maintaining their focus on the characters. This series thrives in characters, artwork, and animation. It is weak in story, fantasy, and action elements. 
If you can stomach the plot, this series is well worth the watch  (7/10)

    It's been a long time since I was hooked on a shounen release - pure fighting, action and not much thinking. Sometimes I'm just looking to escape from reality and some of these anime do it. Have a good laugh, enjoy and that's it. Some of these anime also make you feel sad when you finish it. 
And Xam'd is one of them. I felt stupid for being so hooked on a shounen, typically brainless, no thinking required anime. But it sure felt good.  
Soundtrack-wise, the OP and ED were wonderful. Catchy and easily remembered, much like the opening sequence of tapping feet, the tracks make me want to tap my feet too. 
Production-value for an anime series is high. Unfortunately we seldom see such values any more. I'm sick of this 2009/2010 season's anime and have retreated to a few older series that I missed out.  
A few complaints though. The plot reads suspiciously like something reworked from Eureka 7. Instead of the shoujo being the alien as in Eureka 7, it is now the shounen who gets his exotic Xam'd powers. Similarly a relationship develops between the two - even while you're hoping the shounen will be paired with Nakiami, the tsunderere. 
I cannot help but keep drawing comparisons between E7 and Xam'd because later in both series, both shoujos snipped off  their hair too. The characters might have as well been made from the same mould, which explains the rating of 6 for characters and 7 for story. Originality was just not there.  
However, you should not let this detract you from enjoying the show. If you're willing to suspend disbelief. then suspend comparison as well - sit back and enjoy it for the brainless, non-thinking show it is.  
Albeit once in a while.

    Bonen No Xamdu. 
At first, I heard about it from a friend, and when I checked, it raised my attention since usually Bones Studio made wise choices (or at least, that fits my tastes: Darker than Black, FMA, Gosick wasn't bad too, etc.). So I decided to try it, despite the fact that usually I do not like mecha animes. 
I got a bit surprised by the first episode, quite not what I expected, but not that attractive. So I let it go for a long time, and then one day, out of animes, I tried it again. And the magic happened. 
After a few episodes, it quickly becomes something else that just the stereotypical mecha/war anime, it becomes an original adventure where you follow several characters and their development throughout this adventure. As it goes on, you get more and more interested in the different characters, as their relationships grow. 
This anime provides an in-depth vie of life and its hardships. Several characters have a real behaviour, by that I mean that they are not either ""all black"" or ""all white"", and their actions are realistic. It also focuses a lot on relationships (friendships and family), and how they can evolve in such an environment (the three first characters right at the beginning of the anime will get thrown apart, and will try to reunite once again, but war and personal interests will come across. This story is the story of their struggles and the way they try to overcome them). 
 Music will always beautifully support the emotional scenes, and the world created is incredibly well made, contributing to this breathtaking adventure. The ending is also one of the best I have seen, and all in all, this anime was one of the strongest emotional anime I have seen. 
If I were to give an advice about Bounen No Xamdou, it will be that if you like emotional anime, if you are not looking for something too light-hearted, watch it. It might lack a bit of action, but it definitely makes up by showing several well-developed characters.

    From the studio that made Eureka Seven comes Bounen no Xamdou a 26 episode series bearing the same art style and conventions as E7. 
I'm not going to go too far and say that this was a fantastic masterpiece, as some people claim. I will not claim that the series is terrible. To me Bounen no Xamdou is a good series that is quite entertaining but bears some flaws, but they are not bad enough to ruin the experience of the show. 
Like Eureka Seven the art is fantastic, and should be greatly praised. The story is a little lacking in terms in explaining itself but as I said before it didn't bother me that much. 
As for the characters, i guess they were all lovable in their own small way. Some change during the course of the series and others don't.  The characters  don't bore you, which is the most important part.  
In conclusion, this series is above average. I enjoyed it and you will too. The story is nothing to rave over but it is still a great series. It washed off the taste of Eureka Seven AO >.<

    Sentan Island is caught in the middle of a warzone. Akiyuki looks like your everyday student rushing off to school when there is an air raid and the school bus he was on explodes. While trying to help a refugee he helped sneak onto the bus, he finds himself ""Xam'd"" - when a human is injected with a seed known as ""Hiruko"" transforming them into a raging creature. Nakiami, a girl who just happened to be in the area from the courier ship ""Zanbani"" spots him and takes him in, offering to teach him how to control the Hiruko within him. Even though he is given little hope of returning to his human life, he continues to believe he'd be able to return home to the island one day. 
It has an interesting setting that kind of looks like your modern day Japan but not quite so at the same time. If you replaced the traditional buildings of Japan that next to modern day structures with ones from a fantasy JRPG then you pretty much got the setting. Artwork looks great, action scenes are good but you'd probably expect that from a big name studio like Bones. It's not an uptight, gloomy action show despite all the conflict and everyone struggling to get through it all. Thanks to the vivid colours, beautifully drawn backgrounds and the odd joke here and there it lightens up when you least expect it. 
The show kind of hits you with all sorts of mysteries right from the start and rather than let characters clear things up, you're left to piece together the shreds of info and figure them out yourself. You'd probably be compelled to watch whether Akiyuki's determination bears fruit in the end. No one on board the Zanbani pampers him despite his condition and he is made to earn his stay. You kind of keep keep watching to learn more about the world setting too, why there are factions at war and what the whole ""Xam'd"" thing is about. 
I think the only downside is that it branches out too much towards the end of the show as it tries to cover all the different characters. That said, it's still a good show for the most part. 
Out of interest, this is Masayuki Miyaji's debut as an Anime director and he was responsible for the storyboarding of many popular action shows such as Attack on Titan, Kabaneri Fortress of Steel, Durarara x2 Ketsu, Sword Art Online S2.

    Review on 20th December 2015 
Childhood memories...I see a Xam'd and thought, ""so freaken cool."" And then stand in front of the sun, waiting for the sun to strike me in the arm so that I can turn into a Xam'd...joking! But the first point was kinda true, they were cool. Back to the review, Xam'd Lost Memories is an anime by Bones, who also made the not as impressive Ouran High School Club. But is Xam'd Lost Memories just as bad, or better then OHSC (not typing all that again). Let's find out. 
NOTE: Like my review on Clannad Afterstory, animation and sound is Art and sound is opening/ending. 
Plot: 9/10 
The plot is great, just not into the levels of amazing. I liked how realistic the anime is. Like, normally in anime, someone sees a giant monster thingy and doesn't give a damn about it, even going to the point of praising it. HOWEVER! Xam'd Lost Memories went another path. They went as far as getting the police in to catch these Xam'd, and that's what I liked about the plot. It's quite realistic about what will happen if it happens in real life. I didn't really see any sort of plot holes, which is good as well. Additionally, I actually enjoyed going through the past of some of the characters. They help reinforce the main plot, and is very interesting. However, personally, I didn't really enjoy the ending, but completely understand why they did it. Overall, it gets a 9. 
Characters: 6/10 
Only fair to be honest, but I will start with the pros. Guys, prepare the ice cream and find Papi, you gonna need it, cause this point is gonna be really, really long. So long, it has to be put into paragraphs. 
Like I said, we are starting with the pros. Firstly, I enjoyed some of the characters past. Ummm....some. Like I said, they are interesting to know and helped make the plot interesting. Another thing I liked is how enjoyable some of the characters. Everyone is unique, which makes up for some interesting interactions. 
However, with these pros, there are a couple of cons to go with it. The first con is that how there was barely any character development in the anime, and that is a major issue. If there is no character development, then the characters become forgettable and loses their enjoyment as the anime goes on. Another thing bad about the characters, is how quick some of the interesting characters die. There was one character I was interested on, and then he just...dies halfway through. ADDITIONALLY, I SERIOUSLY HATE ON HOW THEY WERE STILL INTRODUCING CHARACTERS AT THE SECOND LAST EP! It's just, ugh! Someone give me ice-cream. All these cons has harshly affected the score of the characters from a 9 to a 6. 
Sound/animation: 10/10 
Ahhh yes! The era of superb animations like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Puella Magi Magica Mekaoka, or something like that. Love the design of the Xam'd and the animation, and the sound is just great. Yep, that's enough said. 
Opening/ending: 9/10 
Fawa time! Fawa time! No wait, wrong anime. Let it go! Let it go! Even further away...Run away! Run away! There we go! I simply like the opening and ending, it fits pretty well to this kind of anime. However, the ending to me isn't too catchy, and that's why it got a 9. 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
I enjoyed the anime, however wasn't keen to keep on watching the anime. I didn't really feel suspense in the anime between episodes, which would usually make me stop watching. However, because of my childhood memories, I kept on watching it, and even though I didn't feel the need to keep on watching, I still enjoyed the plot. 
Overall: 42/50 
They should seriously make a spinoff, called X'mas Lost Memories, where the main character insteads tries to find the almighty X'amd tree. Ummm...yea, not gonna happen. Back to finding girls to make their wishes come true.

    This is my first review so I am going to be quick and get to the point. This is good series to watch especially if you like FMA or Eureka Seven. The characters and plot are well thought out and will keep you engaged throughout the series. As with Eureka Seven there is love story in the show but it is not as over whelming. There are a couple of fight scenes near the end that will remind you of Eureka Seven though. I do think this show would have benefited greatly if it was longer perhaps at least 40 episodes, because there are some parts of the plot that are explained fairly quickly which was nice but I think they could have explored these extraneous parts in the way that FMA did without it damaging the show. Personally I think that had they did I would have rated an 8 instead of a 7. Over all I liked the show, and as with most shows the series gets better the more the plot gets explained.

    Also known as Xam'd: Lost Potential.  But really, what an incredibly satisfying and yet disappointing show.  The main reason I had such high hopes for Xam'd is that it's basically Bones doing Ghibli.  This isn't coincidence: before making his directorial debut here, Masayuki Miyaji was an Assistant Director for the critically-acclaimed Spirited Away.  So what did we get?  A hodgepodge of promising themes, stories, and characters that are never fully developed in the paltry 26 episodes allotted; gorgeous animation and audio nearly fit for a Miyazaki film; and a sense of deep regret that more thought didn't go into developing a better core, be it some underlying philosophical meaning or even a vaguely interesting climax.  For 20 episodes, I was thinking this could be a new favorite.  For the last 6, I was wondering just how much damage had been done. 
Let's start with the Miyazaki influence.  In many respects Xam'd feels like a cross between Princess Mononoke and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.  Each features an environmentalist message and strong female protagonist with a connection to all living beings.  Here the role of San/Nausicaä is played by Nakiami.  From her desire to live in harmony with creatures feared and ostracized by society, to her character design and even her flying kayak (which looks and operates like Nausicaä's mehve), Nakiami is not particularly original.  This isn't a problem: San and Nausicaä are, after all, from films over a decade old.  Nakiami, rather than coming off as an overused knockoff, is refreshing, and easily one of the best characters in the show if not of any anime in recent years.  Fortunately, even though she isn't the ""main"" character, she gets more airtime and development than anyone else. 
Xam'd's look and sound is also heavily influenced by Miyazaki.  The animation is essentially Ghibli on a tighter budget, and the result is beautiful.  While it's not Princess Mononoke, most of the time only the exacting eye could tell you how it falls short.  The soundtrack has some excellent tracks that feel like they've been ripped right out of Nausicaä.  See, e.g., Xam'd theme song; Taiyou no Soba.  Xam'd also features one of the best OPs and better EDs I've heard, see Boom Boom Satellites: Shut Up and Explode, and Kylie: Vacancy, as well as an amazing voice cast (English).  Blake Shepard in particular, who plays Akiyuki, could be the next Johnny Yong Bosch, and the more seasoned Luci Christian is perfect as Nakiami. 
Alright, good job Xam'd, but what do you have to offer beyond repackaging some Ghibli themes, characters, and production values?  What does your story offer, and what are the rest of your characters like?  This is where matters get complicated.  From the beginning, Xam'd's plot is pretty good; a bit unoriginal but plenty to work with and to get your attention.  There is a war - the Northern Government and Southern Continent Free Zone are having at it while Sentan Island, home of our young protagonist Akiyuki Takehara, remains neutral.  There is also a strange, ostracized people, the Tessik, who seem to bear a spiritual connection to the Xam'd.  One day, all hell breaks loose.  During a field trip, Akiyuki and his best friends Haru and Furuichi are caught up in an explosion caused by a Tessik girl, a thing called a hiruko flies into Aki's arm, and he becomes Xam'd!  Not long after this explosion the Northern Government attacks and Akiyuki is forced to fight off a human-form monster (a hiruko-infused human similar to Xam'd).  Victorious but unable to control the raging hiruko within him, Akiyuki begins to turn to stone until Nakiami (another Tessik girl) arrives to save him and takes him aboard the international postal ship, the Zanbani, where his journey begins. 
These first few episodes raise a number of great questions that are unfortunately never satisfactorily resolved.  Why is there a war?  Why are the Tessik ostracized by everyone else?  What is a hiruko, why do they exist, why do they turn people into Xam'd, and why are they so lonely?  Why does the Quickening Chamber operate as it does, and why (without huge spoilers) do things have to end the way they do?  Failing to answer key questions isn't the best way to tell a story, but it gets worse.  While I have to applaud the relatively large cast of well-developed, memorable, and generally likable characters (e.g., Haru, Midori, Furuichi, Fusa, the badass, raunchy Ishuu, and too many others to name), I was surprised at how empty and bland Akiyuki turned out.  In the first episode he comes across as this cool, opinionated, rebellious type with a lot of character, but as the plot progresses his development is oddly pushed to the side, and he ends up being defined almost entirely by the characters around him.  By the end it felt as if Nakiami were the true main character, and Akiyuki functioned solely as a vessel for the Xam'd.  Perhaps this was intended, but it isn't a good way to make me care about what, if anything, happens to him in the end. 
In a way Akiyuki is symbolic of the show as a whole: promising some complexity in the beginning, but relatively static in the end.  This was especially true with respect to the various ""deep questions"" (see, pseudo-philosophy) raised only to receive a shallow response or no response at all.  For instance, the Xam'd all say ""I want to live.""  Aki's dad says early on ""A question without an answer is truth.  Yet people must continue to question themselves.  It's in their nature.""  There is a long speech about ""this is your enemy, that is your enemy, blah blah blah.""  What do these things mean?  Hell if I know.  As far I could tell, they didn't bear the slightest relation to the underlying plot.  Perhaps the worst of all was the climax, which at least offered some answers but couldn't have been more mundane.  Then we're all supposed to be emotional and involved, and I'm busy looking at my list for something else to watch while episode 26 plays in the background.  By the end the show had just devolved into a mess, with too much going on, too many characters getting attention while Akiyuki got virtually none, and too hasty and lackluster of an explanation.  Do I want those ~12 hours of my life back?  Absolutely not, because the first 20 episodes were so enjoyable, even if they were sullied by the last 6.  At the same time, that is the worst kind of disappointment: climbing to the top, only to plummet back down in the end.

    In a world plagued by war, one young man tries to find his place during a time when many others around him barely understand their own purpose in life. The result of this is a world where the citizens cling to anything that give them hope, whether that be religion, the military, or family. It's in this world that X'amd: Lost Memories transports its viewers. 
Suffice it to say, X'amd is looking to throw the audience into a world they barely understand. The first episode is full of terms and phrases that will confuse you to their meaning. And believe it or not, half of your questions won't be answered by the series' end. And that's okay. Because X'amd isn't about the story. Well, that's not entirely true. The anime is very much story driven, but it's not important for you to know the details of the world. That's not the point. The point is to watch different characters grow and understand themselves better as the series goes on. 
That's the main focus of this anime. How do characters grow and react to the different situations they're placed in? You may never know how or why a particular battle or machine works. You will know that a character learned a lesson from the experience, though. That's what makes X'amd such an entertaining show. The characters are the real force that pushes the show forward. 
Having said that, some of the characters are not as developed as I would like and there are some questions left unanswered about certain characters by the end. But for the most part, the characters are very strongly put together. Each character is different from the other and nearly all of the characters you see in the series will undergo some sort of personal change and growth. This makes it a very emotional anime at times and plenty of tears are shed by a slew of people as they struggle to overcome some sort of difficult thing in their life. 
Accompanying all of this is some absolutely stunning animation. The background sets and pieces are drawn to an amazing detail. Every background in the series looks gorgeous and the battle scenes are incredibly well drawn and animated. The anime's soundtrack is also high caliber. Each scene is graced by fitting music and it can really drive the mood of any particular scene as it reaches a pitch or climax. 
Overall, X'amd: Lost Memories is one of the better anime's I have watched and fully recommend it. While it doesn't answer every question a viewer has and the story does have some issues that are never explained in detail, the character development and the beautiful animation that goes with it makes X'amd a must-watch for any anime enthusiast.

    I will keep this review very simple. 
The Good: 
(1) This anime has a very intriguing poster cover. 
(2) The art is very decent. 
(3) Makes Guilty Crown look like a master piece in comparison.  
The Bad:  
(1) This anime has no plot whatsoever. 
(2) I repeat, this anime has no story whatsoever. 
(3) This anime is what garbage are made of. 
Believe me when i say this anime has no plot whatsoever, i almost lost my mind enduring this garbage of an anime. This is my second time giving an anime a negative review, the first being Guilty Grown (and now i feel like i did that one injustice, Guilty Crown now looks like a master piece in comparison to Bounen no Xamdou). 
I usually keep the negative comments to myself so as not to discourage others from trying it out, cause you know.... everyone has his/her own preference and might see things differently, but then there are times like these when i just have to call a spade a spade, in this case garbage. 
No offense but anyone giving this anime a rating higher than 5 needs to have their head examined, cause something might have snapped while watching Bounen no Xamdou.

    I'm a big fan of the Eureka 7 series so when I came across Xam'd, I was excited about being able to watch a series w/ the same visual stylings.  Not only is the art similar, but the characters and storyline have strong similarities.  Heck, they even have a flying base ship in this series too! Although I enjoyed Xam'd, I felt that the main characters weren't as compelling as the support characters and that grew frustrating as the series wore on.  Xam'd is an entertaining journey, but gets a little convoluted in it's storytelling towards the later stages of this series and perhaps gets a little too ambitious in attempting to tie together it's various storylines.  Visually, I have no complaints, it's a joy to behold.  And, it's nice to have some catchy music by Boom Boom Satellites to open the show.  That was a pleasant surpirse.   I'm also hooked on the closing sequence's music by Kylee!  Enjoy!

    From the get go, when I started watching Xam'd, I thought of Howl's moving castle. Other who have watched this I'm sorry if you disagree with me, but the graphics, animation, fantasy story seemed so similar. Of course two different kind of stories, but I insist if you liked Howl's moving castle and its animation and its emotional journey and climb...You will like Xam'd :) 
okay talking about the my scoring... 
The story was amazing, I didn't think there was any unnecessary episodes that seemed like a filler you would see in many anime series. The story personally took me a while to understand what is going on in this ""world"" but once I understood what was happening I fell in love with how the story took off :) For me since now I understand what is going on, a second time watching it will probably be more enjoyable than the first! 
The art really reminded me of the style of Howl's moving castle. This is probably why I thought it seemed so similar. Well I loved the animation, it was well done and the action sequences seemed to flow well! wonderful work! 
Wow the sound was great, I loved the Intro and ending songs on each episode. But looking back on the show, the music or sound during the anime didn't stand out. Its more of a I didn't notice any crummy sounds, or any amazing sounds so it must of been good. I think I might of been so worked up to the story that everything else seemed short to it. But I did notice a great usage in sound during climatic moment and emotional heartfelt times :) 
Characters were well developed, funny and interesting. In this world of fantasy and magic I would say each character fills the parts and has a deep relationship with others. You notice tension right off the back with certain characters that make you want to watch more to see what will happen. They did a great job with the characters.  
The Enjoyment factor was up there! I enjoyed the heartfelt moments, the comical parts, the sorrow and dreadful moments of the show. This show had all emotions of the pyramid and it used it well. It kept me uneasy for what was going to happen next and kept me more than entertained!  
Overall this is a very solid anime! The Story were well above par, they had catching graphics that reminded me of Howl's moving castle. Sound were well in certain parts of the story. Characters were very heartfelt and the story as a whole was great! I see myself watching this series again and probably getting more out of it the second time around! 
All I can say is Enjoy :D

    This show is the prime example of why the points scale for ratings on this site will never be able to reliably encompass the opinions of raters. The show has really good art and sound and for people that watch a lot of anime its hard to give shows like this poor average or poor ratings. You just see too much crap art to demean a show that goes the extra mile in the aesthetics department, But the plot is fundamentally flawed and stories make the show, no getting around it. 
Most negative reviews point out cliche stuff like shallow character development and poorly thought out ending but this show just, ugh, it's just not right. The story's attentions is to diluted. Following characters for long periods that don't effect or convey the themes efficiently. There are a lot of flat out unnecessary characters. This is compounded by not streamlining the driving forces of the story. For example, fine you wanna spend time following some little kid for hours to show his difficulty with his upbringing and parent loss but then, instead of showing other characters issues with child rearing and relationships with parents the next scenes are that of some place getting bombed. They then will bring up questions involving existentialism and what no,t when all though that may relate to parenting they haven't began to tie it in to the theme of the plot. It'll be like one characters mom died, then a scene of someone unrelated to the character hvings their arm blown off, then they show the military performing morally questionable experiments and then they focuson  potentially developing relationships between characters. NOT JUST LOSE ENDS, BUT A BUTCH OF SIMULTANEOUS SUBPLOTS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO THE CORE STORY. In the end I don't know what the conclusion is supposed to bring, a end to the war, romantic relationships, uhhhhh, temporary fixes, or reflection for lost lives. What was Akiyuki trying to do this whole time? Really if you have and answer tell me. Save the world, save a girl, save a marriage, save a people? and which one of those was accomplished that warrented a definite conclusion? If I sound flustered its cuz I am. Whatever, just tell me what happened in the climax that resolved the major issue whatever it was?

    Do you want to experience a very deep story with good romance, drama, action as well as art along with exceptional characters? then, this anime is for you. 
Presenting you a masterpiece by the creator of Eureka Seven 
Story (9/10):Its about a boy who goes into a misadventure without his own will. a story about the extent of the bond called friendship, and he troubles he faces in order to survive. the story was Dark, but it was pleasant. there were times when you actually laugh and actually cry. i found the story quite realistic. the anime explains all the emotions that a person may experience when they are in a bind, which includes from jealousy to fear. the spoiler of the ending is explained below if you are interested to know how it all ends. Incase you dont understand what happened ( will mostly happens), you may read the spoiler below after completing the anime. 
[SPOILER] 
i should not say anything about the ending, however these kind of anime tend to turn out to be a sad ending, or an open ending which holes your heart forever...... however this is not in this case. the ending was preety good, though it's hard to understand what actually happened. the anime leaves a kind of open ending which is left up to the viewers to imagine what happened. this is what i understood: 
Route 1 (happy end): the protagonist completed his days being a stone and finally returned back to his beloveds. 
Route 2 (open end): the female protagonist goes near his location, and imagines his talking to him, however this presents a happy open ending where it is made sure that he will return back to her ""someday"" 
[SPOILER END] 
Art (8/10): what else can you expect from the creators of Eureka? its animation quality is same as eureka 7, assuming you have already watched it. the action scenes, and facial expressions are superb. 
Sound (8/10) a fitting sound for a dark themed anime. the sound especially, made it eerie. when you are watching it along  with the sound, you experience the sorrow expressed in the scenes, however giving you hope that it will all turn out good sometime. 
Characters (10/10) what can i say, OUTSTANDING. its been a while since i watched an anime which presents such realistic characters. 
3 friends, two of them followed their own routes. one turned out to be good, and the other bad.  the third friend develops feeling for of of them, which turn the second one insane. a marvelous combination of emotions. 
apart from the 3 main characters, the antagonists were on part with their uniqueness.  
Enjoyment (9/10) : the anime itself is unique in its class, and i doubt anyone else can copy its elements. a true masterpiece, and truly enjoyable, however not a 10 because i wanted to see more than 26 episodes, and i wished that a few sidestories about the side characters were explained a bit more, which was definitely not possible in a mere 26 episode anime. 
Overall (8/10) an anime worth watching if you enjoy dark and mature theme.

    亡念のザムド  -  Bounen no Xamdou is a very beautiful, retro-futuristic adventure created by Studio Bones and co-producters Sony/Aniplex with a lot of ambition. I really like the anime for its great graphics, the character designs, the art in general, the good music and because the plot is not the typical monotony. 
Story: Complexity disguised in simplicity but perpetual changes demand attention (7/10) 
The Series is more demanding than the basic story of the military conflict between the Northern Government and the Southern Continent Free Zone, in which our male protagonist is inadvertently drawn, suggests. As a victim of a terrorist act in which his body becomes the host of a symbiotic organism, it is up to him to find his way to deal with his new ambivalent existence, the so-called Xam'd. In addition to the military and human conflicts, the plot skilfully deals with topics such as the exclusion of ethnic minorities, religion and the basic principles of humanistic thinking as well as genetics and their military application. Despite 26 episodes, the plot is extensive, the story not only focuses on the protagonists Akiyuki or Nakiami, but also illuminates other characters with a lot of depth, even if those are lost soon again because the course of the action takes a different path. Some viewers will certainly find this tiring, as you can not only relax and watch the anime, but have to concentrate on the story. As far as I'm concerned, this is one reason why the series is among the best, that 2008/09 had to offer. 
Characters: good development, at times somewhat questionable, since soon eliminated (8/10) 
This anime has a very large cast and almost everyone receives a very good development. Almost no character appear and remain one-dimensional, which is a pity for the characters, who only serve a side story and then no longer occur. All in all, the cast is due to their different personalities and background information, besides, the interpersonal conflicts are very interesting and often the viewer is forced to think about whether the character is a friend or an enemy - that makes it exciting. The cast is too big to describe them all. Even if you focus only on the crew of the airship Zanbani, there are many, interesting and multi-faceted characters from the captain to the machinist. So my description of the characters will be limited to a few. 
* The description of the characters may contain spoilers, so take a look at the anime first. * 
Takehara, Akiyuki: 
He is a slightly mischievous teenager, whose goodness of heart promptly gets him in great trouble and him to the beginning of his adventurous journey. So far, it sounds more like the typical monotony, but as mentioned earlier, the characters go through ups and downs in a very flexible plot. You never know what's next, I liked that a lot. On the other hand, his background story is plausible and illustrated in a very human way. 
Nakiami: 
Her character is very interesting, she is very mature for her young age and her behaviour and actions are marked by the desire to protect life, no matter what kind. She bears a great responsibility. Actually a calm and thoughtful character, on the other hand also energetic and enthusiastic. A special plus is that she is not afraid to accept the rebukes for her actions. 
Benikawa, Ishuu:  
She is the captain and my personal favourite. With her strong will, she holds the Zanbani crew together. She is strict, does not tolerate disobedience and has full respect for the crew. This is surely because everyone knows that she is tough, but also has a good heart and does not let anyone down. She comes across very rough, because her hobbies are smoking, drinking and weapons, but she is also educated and enjoys to read sophisticated literature. All in all, a lady with whom one should not mess with. 
Takehara Ryuuzou: 
Akiyuki's father and the village doctor. He is a very likeable character and simply the best example of an ex-husband. The doctor lives for his work, which also led to divorce. He is chaotic but also brilliant, a calm and very kind person. He still mourns the time with his wife Fusa, but when they meet, he manages to annoy his ex-wife in no time. 
* spoiler alert end * 
Visuals: clean & fluid, good use of colours & contrasts, Animation & Art very good quality (9/10) 
The art is detailed and creative, the colours were silky lively and the contrasts are well done. The design of the world of Bounen no Xamdou is a feast for the eyes. It's a simple yet futuristic world. The mix of old technology like a simple school bus and on the other hand, airships and biotechnology, are very successful examples of beautiful steampunk elements. What I liked most about the design was that objects, whether aircrafts, houses, vehicles, etc., had beautiful and credible traces of usage or signs of decay, for example walls had various shades, cracks, colour differences or at times a brick was missing. These all are just little things, but I like it a lot. The character designs are also very well done, the faces and bodies are very different and fit well with their roles. The facial expressions convey the feelings very well, both in the funny and above all in the melancholic moments. You can well imagine the emotional world of the characters, based on the visual representation. 
The animation is fluid and clean, stunning for a non-movie anime. Not only the fighting scenes are very well implemented in terms of animation, even very small moments are very noticeable. For example, I noticed Nakiami wiping the mirror in the bathroom, which was still misted, and you can see the reflection of her face in the mirror. That's just a small thing, but with great attention to detail, and that's not the standard, certainly not in 2008/09. All in all, the art department creates a great overall picture. I know that it is not the Studio Ghibli, but the picture quality is largely in line with the standards of the well-known studio.  
Sounds: really good BGM & sound effects, a little worse in terms of VA (7/10) 
The high expectations with regard to the background music, which are aroused by the very appealing look of the anime, are fully fulfilled. The compositions of Oshima Michiru have already given many other animes a harmonious musical framework, so it is no surprise that the music is tonally very appealing again. The BGM underlines the plot very well, especially moving moments are emotionally well conveyed, but the music is never intrusive. The sound spectrum is very extensive, from calm-soulful, classically oriented arrangements with choir to well rocking sounds. 
The  first OP ""Shut up and Explode"" comes from Boom Boom Satellites. The electronic rock duo Kawashima-Nakano has been active since the 90`s. Among other things, they have made the soundtrack for the anime ""appleseed"". The OP is a casual-rocking prelude, creates anticipation for the anime and is well done. 
The second OP ""Back On My Feet"" is also from Boom Boom Satellites. It has a similar sound as the first OP, a bit faster and the music is more in the foreground. The animation is again very well designed, with scenes and characters from the series. 
The ED ""Vacancy"" sung by Kylee, is a nice and rather melancholy ending. The singer has a really nice voice. The song was great, but the real breakthrough did not happen despite her beautiful voice. 
The voice actors are well chosen but not all convince in the presentation. However, I was very impressed by the voice of Sapei, Yuuuko, who gave Nakiami her voice. The voice is calm and yet very feminine, as well as pleasant to understand. Unfortunately, not all other voice actors were able to convince me so well. 
Personally, I consider Bounen no Xamdou a clear recommendation, because watching the anime conveys the same feeling as reading good literature. The series is not a hunt from one climax to the next, but it's exciting and mesmerizing with constant change / evolution as well as breathtaking visual quality right up to the end. On the other hand, the unusual plot requires a lot of concentration. Viewers, who prefer an entertainment that follows a clear structure, this anime will be a particular challenge. For these, it may be better to skip the anime. But on the other hand, if you read my review and do not get scared, give it a try! I'm sure it will be a pleasant experience. 
Thanks for reading and have fun watching.

    Xam'd: Lost Memories is a sprawling fantasy from acclaimed animation studio Bones. In the tradition of  the grand adventures like Full Metal Alchemist and Eureka Seven; Xam'd creates a vast fantasy world, complete with a big cast of characters and an intricate mythos. It also touches on themes of identity and the tole of war. Xam'd tries to accomplish a lot, in fact maybe too much for its 26 episodes, as the show becomes uneven as it reaches its conclusion. Despite this, Xam'd is certainly worth taking a look at. 
The story takes place in a world in conflict. There is a war between the Northern Empire and the free lands in the South. However, the war is far from high school student Akiyuki Takehara's mind, as his home Sentan Island has remained tranquil. That is until a sudden attack thrusts the island into the conflict; Akiyuki is transformed into a monstrous being (called Xam'd) in the ordeal and taken from the island by a mysterious girl named Nakiyami. He is taken aboard an airship where he must train to master the monster residing within him. Meanwhile, his friends back on the island join the military in order to find him. 
Xam'd has a lot going on, from the big conflict of the war with the North to sacred sacrifical rituals. However, it is the character drama that proves the driving force of the series. Each character has there own personal struggle, such as Akiyuki learning to co-exist with the Xam'd residing within him and Nakiyami having unfinished business with the past she ran away from. The complicated relationships between many of the characters also adds to the drama; most notable is the one between Akiyuki and his two friends from Sentan Island, Naru and Furuichi. The show explores complex themes of identity and personal relationship through the characters and their struggles. This makes Xam'd a compelling and multi-layered drama that kept me involved from beginning to end. 
The world of Xam'd is vast, which is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, the world is highly intriguing; one thing that kept me engaged in the story was the fantasy elements continually provided interesting twists and turns. The themes of the story were also accentuated well through the supernatural, further enriching the show's drama. At the same time, if you are looking for detailed explanation, then you are out of luck. Things like the existence of of Xam'd and Humanforms (the North's living weapons), and why the war is even being fought get only the vaguest of explanations, and sometimes do not completely make sense. 
The big issue this series runs into is in its second half; there is simply too much going on at once. The show splits its attention between four different story lines. This, of course, means that you will have to pay close attention to know what exactly is going on. Even then however, the story comes across in a somewhat confused and contrived manner. Moreover, juggling around story lines inevitably means that some characters who had heavy focus earlier are pushed aside until the plot needs them again. This makes any catharsis they might have feel forced and not as meaningful as the ought to have been. The show manages to tie the different story lines together well, which is certainly an admirable feat, but is somewhat marred by a lackluster final episode. 
Studio Bones is known for the high production value of its shows, and Xam'd is no exception to the rule. Character designs and backgrounds are sharp, well detailed, and distinctive. The animation is crisp and fluid, doing the colorful art justice. The art style itself has a similar flare as Eureka Seven (minus the boarding mechs, of course), especially regarding the Humanforms which are reminiscent to the Coralians from Eureka seven in their otherworldly appearance. However, Xam'd also feels a bit more grounded in reality, featuring less cartoon-ish faces and body language; and of course is more fantasy themed, where Eureka was Sci-fi. There are a few times where character rendering is a bit rough, but the animation is solid for the most part. The music is equally as good, fitting for the epic scope the show aims for. The music supports the show well through its quite moments and grand battles. 
Xam'd is a flawed work, but by no means a bad one. The characters' struggles with identity and relationships makes for some very compelling drama. The battles are equal parts exhilarating and horrifying. Despite being somewhat muddled, the story is still very engaging and really does have a few moments of greatness. All in all, a pretty good way to fill up a few hours of your time. 
On a side note: Nakiyami is clearly inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's character Nausicaä; from her appearance to her respect for all living beings.

    What did I just watch? 
Bounen no Xamdou is one of those show where you watch it to the end hypnotized by the pretty visuals and then when it finished you realize you have no idea what the hell the entire thing was about. 
I have to check two wikis to get a rough understanding of the plot, cause BONES suck at exposition and thought cryptic means good. The only thing I got was confusion out of the entire thing.  
Story - ? 
The story is about a war between two countries with one having some organic weapon cult thingy? I think? The reason I say this is because the entire show can't seem to decide what it want to be, at first it seems like a story about a young man dealing with the fact he became a monster-thingy and need to learn to control it, but then there is this weird cult and war thing added in and then it became Ultraman with a big fucking doomsday monster showing up related to the cult and it was defeated by giving it a name? 
I got no freaking clue and the world with the steampunk mixed with highschool mixed with culty-cult look didn't help, it felt like the entire thing was created by hacking stitching three very different show together and hoped to create something even better but the result was this Frankenstein monster show. 
I got no idea why the war is important, how the Xamdou soul thingy works, why or what the coo-coo cult are trying to accomplish, and why is the tech level all over the place. 
Character - Good, I guess? (7?) 
They certainly have a lot of character and angst, but with the confusing context, they just couldn't engage me. The ending had the MC and the red-hair die or sealed for 9 and 1000 year respectively, and all I felt was ""Cool animation, they really spent a lot of money on this."" I guess they were trying to go for a philosophical ""Who am I"" thing, but I felt this is the dumbest philosophy to ponder about (you get more mileage debating with 8-year-old on youtube comment section then consider this). 
But regardless, the characters have background, development and conclusion , so you might get attached to them and care (though I personally didn't). Even if it is all buried underneath a confusing world/plot and a pointless pretentious philosophy.  
Art, Sound - 9, 9 
Gorgeous and amazing, you don't see this level of quality anymore, a relic of past time when the industry hasn't start sucking its own fart and began getting brain damage. 
Overall - 5 
Great show for seeing how anime used to be very great and try hard (even if this appears to try too hard and ended up breaking its back), with beautiful animation and music, a good cast, and a plot that try to be meaningful and deep (though it failed but at least it tried).

    It's a great work.  
At first I even thought about stopping to watch, but when the story began to develop I was very surprised.  
The story has totally changed direction and characters that at first seem unimportant, began to gain ground and become very important for the work.  
The OST is very good, especially the opening.  
The art itself did not please me much, but it did not spoil the anime.  
I recommend this anime to everyone, it really is an anime that is worth watching.

    xam'd is a mecha,romance,fantasy, sci fiction,slice of life,  shojo/shoenen esque anime. 
story: kinda a boring plot and i dont think much really happened atleast anything important.dont wan spoil anything watever. a bit filierish. still entertaining thouh. 
art: The mech designs look kinda dull and a little , but look pretty cool once they start going and attack other things. Animation is pretty standard some good, some bad. Sometimes the animation looks real stiff at times or very unnatural.pretty similiar to e7  quality animation. overall decent. 
sound: RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY 
sums up my opinion of the opening (no offense).  and the ending is generic mainstream j-rock music. so nothing really special. thought everyone's voices ok cept the main character sounds very monotone and somewhat annoying.  
character:  as of right now most of the characters are forgettable cept that one guy whose name i cant remember . well he's a cool guy , walks around being all stinky and aint afraid of anything. Then it got better when he got naked in the tub but they ruined by having him shave off his sexy facial hair.  
enjoyment: a decent watch to pass the time of my boring life til death.

    Wow, what the fuck. This show.  
So this was a show that I went in with quite literally zero expectations, and wow, I was blown the hell away. 
Bounen no Xamdou has a confusing start. It has one of those slow and somewhat boring beginnings that would cause some viewers to drop the show after watching the first few episodes. However, to those who haven't watched this show yet, DO NOT DROP! This is a show that only gets better and better as you watch it, and I believe that it has one of the most satisfying pay offs in anime.  
Bounen no Xamdou is kind of like Gurren Lagann. Its story may be all over the place, but it just screams power and emotion. Bounen no Xamdou may be one of the most emotionally gripping war dramas that I've ever seen, not only in anime, but in any medium ever.  
Bounen no Xamdou's story is actually pretty lackluster, but that's not the main focus of the show. In the end, it's all about the characters, their interactions and reactions, and their development. This show has some of the most gut wrenchingly powerful character reactions I've ever seen. When a character just completely breaks down, I felt like my heart was breaking down along with them. Combined with the absolutely mind blowing music, and the stellar voice acting, this show had me at a state of awe and heartbreak throughout a lot of the show.  
The story itself is full of unexplained themes and mishaps. There are a lot of story elements that just seem unnecessary or vague, but in the end, it still set up all the powerful themes and character interactions beautifully. There are so many impressively powerful themes within the story, such as the idea of living with everyone in harmony, the importance of family, and so much more. It's like this show was actually just the questioning of human morals, as well as the heartbreak that can result over said dispute over human morals. A simple difference in ideals can break apart even the strongest of bonds, and the idea of loss and betrayal can shatter even the strongest of hearts. The beautiful expression of emotions and ideals definitely outweigh any mishaps in the story. 
This is a show that holds a lot of rewatch value, especially after you've only seen it once. Upon knowing the general gist of the setting and the world, you can completely focus on the characters and their emotions/reactions.  
In other words, don't watch for the story, watch for the feels! 
Also, this show has a great amount of action, with the very dynamic Bones animation style! Prepare for lots of explosions! 
TL;DR: Now if only this was a mainstream anime... I guess you would call it... 
*puts on shades* 
Shounen no Xamdou.

    On a ship headed for unknown destinations, cast against ethereal clouds and a violet sunrise, a raven haired beauty reads aloud. Her voice echoes with a mixture of sobriety and apathy. Behind its ostentatious opening and impressive spectacles, it is this somber tone that reveals Bounen no Xam'd's profound humanistic elements and its trust in the resilience of the human spirit. 
For Xam'd, the destination is often as important as the journey itself. While its story begins in the independent civilian center, Sentan Island, Xam'd brings our characters to foreign lands and war ravaged towns, cities turned into industrial waste and forest of stone creatures. Even without explanation, Xam'd's imagery brings to mind a very visceral illustration of the world our characters traverse, and manages to build a mysterious but enthralling place often quite different from our own. 
It is within this world that Xam'd has an incredibly compelling story to tell, rich between the lines, while sparing its audience needless explanation. Many fault the show for having little to no plot, but Xam'd is challenging, and confronts us with a story from the perspectives of characters who are either unwilling to reminisce on the past or have not been alive long enough to experience it. In many ways, Xam'd ""of the Lost Memory"" is quite literal in its description of the show's approach to the story, but that is not to say that Xam'd does not adequately explain the questions that arise throughout. The origins of the Hiruko, the history of aggression between the North and the South, racism and the exile of the Tessikan people, all coalesce not just to bring the world of Xam'd to life, but to craft a set of resonant ideas and themes. 
The characters are likely what will stand out to most people. For one, the cast is rather large, but there is a great variety of interesting faces, many of whom get their fair share of attention and detail. While their pasts are not often fully explicated, there is a strong sense of realism to these people. Be it their struggles or aspirations, many of them are brought to life purely by how flawed they are as people. Whether it's being stuck in the past or unable to speak one's mind, these simple traits turn out to be rather complex and make for great interactions between each other. Even if the story of Xam'd does not catch one's attention, the drama between the characters feel real and organic and are worth it for that alone. 
Include an atmospheric soundtrack and great visuals for its age, and Xam'd is a great recommendation for a tough but captivating science fantasy adventure. The show is, at times, incredibly ambitious with the story it sets out to tell, so much so that it's fair to fault it for reaching too much. However, for all its imperfections, the show is both a gripping drama and intricate in its lore.

    I was very excited to see Xam'd, Bones is my all time animation studio and I was looking forward to something amazing. 
The Animation was some of the best I have seen for a very long time, and did not disappoint. 
The story on the other hand I have a hard time liking, there was a enough substance to keep me watching till the end, but after it was over, and the initial flare from the ending had left me (as quickly as it had arrived) I realized I was deeply dissatisfied with the whole thing. It felt like the most of the anime was very nice story related filler, with no substance, adding very little to the characters, even though if felt like it was trying to. The ending left with little to no closure. There was a mixture of happiness, sadness, confusion, and a deep sense of being cheated out of a decent ending.  
I'd recommend watching Xam'd if you like great animation, or if this genre suits you, but for a seasoned warrior in the anime world, it won't leave a deep impression.

The main problem with Xamd is the story. Story starts out like your typical Shonen, boy receives special ability sets out on a journey to discover more about his ability known as Xamd. An ability which allows the user to change into a bug like creature. Story is interesting initially the main character Akiyuki, and his two friends have an interesting plot where each friend takes a different path as they mature and grow. But the story never matures into anything special from there. After a few episodes you realize the story is just missing something like intelligence or enjoyment. Still it&rsquo;s a good watch if you fancy a fantasy setting, airships and the occasional flashy battle. With that said fighting scenes are very rare but dialogue is abundant. Xamd eventually transforms into this bizarre drama that confuses the hell out of viewers in my opinion. 
I liked the characters but a fatal flaw is that the show focuses far to much on characters no one gives a shit about, about half the episodes focus on side characters for a period of time which kills viewers interest. 
Animation and Sound  
Superb, makes up somewhat for the lack luster story.  
Both Xamd lost memories and Eureka 7 were done by the same team. If you enjoyed one you may enjoy the other. Both Animes have this slow pacing and a level of drama which just kills the anime for me.

    “Memory is a way of holding on to the things you love, the things you are, the things you never want to lose"" (Kevin Arnold). 
Beneath the romantics, action, and tragedy in Xam'd  lies a simple message: the importance of identity, which is perhaps one's most treasured possession. Memories, friendships, relationships, and the power of a name are all components tied into one's identity, which Xam'd examines closely. 
Story - 7 
This was, unfortunately, the most acknowledged fatal flaw in Xam'd that prevented this artwork from being a masterpiece. While it was original, creative, and innovative, the writers made the plot overly complex, creating too many complicated technicalities, making the story difficult to follow and comprehend. However, the general concepts of the plot were understandable, and only mechanical details tripped the story's flow. The setting was brilliantly laid out; the militaristic society in which the story took place was well defined. The cultural and racial conflicts and discrimination in Xam'd were especially a plus to the structure of the plot, aiding in the characterization of the situations. This was one of the main catalysts for the drama in Xam'd, which was definitely one of its greatest features, realistic but in a fictional universe. Overall, the plot was envisioned to be a smooth progression of exciting events, but the theory was not executed as perfectly as planned, leading to its own entanglement. 
Artwork - 9 
The animation was smooth, the colors were silkily vivid, and the overall image of Xam'd is magnificent. There is little to critique in the artwork of Xam'd, as it was definitely not an eyesore. Although not as overly detailed in art as Guilty Crown, nor as originally creative as Bakemonogatari, Xam'd was free of major flaws in the animation, while keeping the setting detailed and pleasing to the eye, constituting ""great"" artwork. 
Sound - 10 
The most fitting part of Xam'd is the brilliant sound. The OST is one of the most perfectly matched for an anime. Original and upbeat opening really catches the attention of any viewer. The orchestral background music was well applied to the setting and drama of the story. Music in Xam'd eases the viewer and is soothingly calming; stringed instruments were great to incorporate into the anime. Bravo to whichever genius decided on the soundtrack of Xam'd. 
Character - 9 
While the story line was lacking a fine, strong foundation, the characters were a dynamic factor in the construction of Xam'd. The strength of the structure of the characters was all about the realistic embodiment of each individual, despite the fact that the story took place in an extremely fictional setting. Especially appealing were the dialogues between all the characters, smooth and natural. The conversations were not at all awkward, and they broadened the characters' relationships beyond appearance and race. The character development was strong, and even though it focused on multiple individuals and groups, Xam'd succeeded in giving insight to the viewers on the characters. Not only did they emphasize the pasts and mindsets of all the characters to the point where sympathy can be held for any character (good or ""evil""), but they also developed the relationships between the many groups of characters, all connecting to the main, Takehara Akiyuki. Although he is the AVERAGE high school student, there could not have been a more dynamic substitute for him; the relations he had with Benikawa's mail crew were another well developed aspect of Xam'd. His charismatic nature leads into the plot development and progression so well, especially as the main factor of this anime is identity. The characters' connections of Xam'd can be visualized as a base, Akiyuki, branching off to a few segments, which branch off to even more characters, which all the relationships were shed light upon. If Xam'd had been a more character-driven plot, there would have been much greater success. The ending, however, was still made magnificent because of the work that had been put into the characters. 
Enjoyment - 9 
What could make a story more exciting than its plot? Drama. It creates suspense and keeps people at the edge of their seats, unable to stop themselves from marathonning the entire series in one sitting. In fact, the enjoyment of Xam'd is probably what causes people (such as myself) to rewatch the series multiple times in hopes of understanding the plot more. The drama, the tensions, and the relationships are what allows us to overlook the flaws and simply enjoy the anime itself. 
Overall - 9 
Despite the nagging feeling that there is something unsettling or unknown about the plot, Xam'd was very enjoyable. The characters are very likable and the setting was creative, with good art and a very strong OST to back it up. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes any genre of anime, because Xam'd has a lot of content packed into it.

    Xam'd: Lost Memories starts with gorgeous visuals and a great score, a staple of any good Bones anime, but Eureka Seven this is not. Rather Xam'd feels so confident in itself that it forgets how to tell its story, and what the viewer is left with is a hodgepodge of plot devices, sudden character and relationship development, and twists that run on no backing whatsoever except that we didn't see it coming. There's only two judgments that can be made from Xam'd: Either it was planned as a 50 episode series or they made it up as they went along. 
These aren't judgments I make lightly either. Characterization is a huge point to be made here. So focused this anime started with its characters with enigmatic pasts and unspecified mysterious connections, but some of these pasts aren't even explained, and most are barely even touched upon. Xam'd filled its cast list too full with too many promises of pasts and relationships that it couldn't cash all the checks it wrote early on. Relationship that aren't thrown to the gutter, such as Akiyuki and Haru's, flourished quite well, and Nakiami's past, while not incredible, was well-done and justified. The problem then is not that the series doesn't develop characters and relationships well, but that it didn't make enough time to explain everyone's character and the nature of their relationships. 
The story however is inexcusable. For such a simple ""lone hero must unite the world"" plot, this series flooded itself with unexplained terminology (I'm still not entirely sure what the hell a Xam'd even is) and splinters off into so many subplots that the core of it becomes lost in the shuffle. Likewise, some of the subplots don't even connect in the end and the ones that do don't do so in any fulfilling way. I loved the character of Yango, but seriously, what was his purpose? He wasn't necessary for Nakiami to make her evolution, yet the story felt the need to carry his character to the end regardless. Never finding its own personal voice, this series tries to compensate by settling the series on an epic scale, but because there is no cohesive element to allow it to do such, it just looks sprawled out, messy and disconnected. In short, Xam'd loses itself in its own expectations for itself. 
Technical aspects are standard Bones and of course that means its near bar-none. Richly painted and vast landscapes blend wonderfully with the conventional but uniquely appealing character designs. Likewise, the animation flows fantastically without flaw. 
The music is also very suitable with some fitting BGM ranging from average to above-average but never below. The OP may not fit for some, but there's a great ED in the mix. Voices are decent but no one really stands out. Rather, the cast list looks like a vocal experiment with an actual little boy playing Yango and Yuko Sanpei playing a girl for once. There are places where it works and places where it doesn't, but the overall result is appealing. 
I would ultimately call Xam'd a glorious failure. I liked it and there's no denying it didn't try to be great, but with multiple pacing problems, characters left unexplored and useless subplots, Xam'd spreads itself so thin that it falls apart. It looks great, it sounds great, but it's not great. Maybe next time, Bones. 
Overall, I give Xam'd: Lost Memories a 7 out of 10.

    This series reminds me of a very elegant and beautiful mansion on the hillside. A most grandiose house amidst the whole perfect ambiance of the forest surrounding it. But, as you venture inside, you find the whole house empty. No residents, furniture scattered around, walls tattered, curtains ripped...there isn't even a single rat scattering about. You are then filled with grave disappointment as you realize that with just the right amount of good care it could have been the best sight you could have ever seen. 
Xam'd Lost Memories is just this. It delivers very well on the aesthetics, but it tries too hard to deliver its plot that it ultimately falls flat on its face. This is disappointing, especially coming from BONES which is one of the production studios I respect(along with Production I.G)that hasn't succumbed to the 'moe' infection in anime today. 
Story-wise, Xam'd had a lot of things going for it. Interesting concepts were abound, good settings and solid foundations for a great universe. However, the problem here lies in the execution. It starts off on a high note, but it increasingly becomes dragged down with too much exposition. Too many terms were dropped with hardly any of them getting adequate development. BONES is highly notorious for this. The Xam'd universe then became too convoluted for a 26 episode series and left me with more questions than answers. This inhibits the viewers to empathize clearly with the characters as they are often left confused as to why those characters are even in the story itself. Pacing issues and poor planning greatly hindered this series from achieving what could have been greatness. 
Xamd's art is great, though. Backgrounds are detailed, with each place having its own motif. Character design is good. Every character has his own unique look and feel--especially the Xam'd. The many different Xam'd designs are innovative, reflecting the fresh approach the series had. Animation quality is top-notch, which is expected from every BONES series. From the visual department, Xam'd delivers perfectly well. Sound is also good; it delivers the right tracks at the right moments without ever sounding bland and dry. The OP and ED are fantastic--the OP being a very exciting and energy-filled song befitting the action-y feel of the show and the ED a somewhat mellower one to ease the tension, so to speak. Aesthetically, Xam'd is many leagues better than its counterparts. 
But the visual and auditory greatness of a show is easily forgotten if the essentials are lacking. Such is the case for Xam'd's characters, who are relatively interesting at first, but are soon engulfed in the dreariness of the plot. The protagonist, for instance, is a copy-paste hero from every action anime. What depth his character had  feels tacked on and he doesn't really put out something new. The only good character the show had was Nakiami, who was also shortchanged at the end. Supporting characters felt artificial, they had really no significant part to the plot. Some of them were even put there just to die meaningless deaths. The characters' uselessness is personified in the blonde military secretary who was just there too look hot and say snappy comebacks and one-liners. Haphazard character development definitely damaged this series. 
Cookie-cutter characters, meandering plot progression, incessant and unnecessary exposition shouldn't really stop you from enjoying Xam'd though. You can just look at the well-animated fight scenes and the unique fantasy feel of the series or just listen to the OP song all day long on repeat(RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY, anyone?).The aesthetics should be enough for the casual anime watcher. For the more experienced and those looking for substance though, if you can get over the series' major flaws, you can definitely have fun watching the show--albeit with your brain turned off. 
Overall, Xam'd Lost Memories isn't a bad watch at all. In fact, it could have been one of the decade's best anime series. It's just too bad that it shot itself in the foot with poor execution, terrible pacing and forgettable characters(I even forgot the doctor's name even though he was semi-important). Just like the beautiful mansion, just looking at it from the outside should be enough satisfaction for anyone. However, if you want substance and would want to look inside,turn away now. Disappointment awaits you just as you walk through the front door.Or even better, just RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY...

    Well, &quot;Bounen no Xamdou&quot;, aka &quot;Xam'd Lost Memories&quot;, aka &quot;Why the F**k Do We Need a Story?&quot; has finally finished. In one sense I must admit that the final episode was consistent with the rest of the anime; and I mean that in the most damning sense because the entire series was without substance. Let me be a bit clearer - the original TV ending to &quot;EVA&quot; was significantly more imaginative, original and meaningful when compared to the ending of Xamdou. 
I don't really care how much effort and money was spent on the animation - Xamdou failed terribly as a story. We were never given any inkling of why there was a war, why there were competing apocalyptical forces at work, what the &quot;Emperor&quot; was, why the audience was supposed to empathize with terrorists, and worst of all, why so many characters that should have been very dead showed up again in the epilogue.  
No matter how many times during the series I gave the writers the benefit-of-the-doubt they returned again and again to metaphysical b.s. that drove my suspension-of-disbelief screaming and running away. Characters pulled their motivations out of their butts at random. The pseudo-science and technology of the world was all eye candy and totally devoid of substance or purpose. Pointless sub-plots crawled out of the depths of triviality to waste any opportunities to provide any consistency to the story. 
I definitely want back the 13 hours of my life that I wasted on this series.

    Bounen no Xamdou is one of those series that took me by surprise. It was on my to watch list for a while, and I really trudged my way through a few misses before I found this one. It's hard to get a gist for what you're going to see by reading a synopsis, because it is a character driven story from start to finish. The overall story isn't bad, but it's really about the people in the story and their relationships with eachother. I was impressed, and it had a satisfying ending as well. Definitely this was a great series. 
It starts our looking like your stereotypical mecha, post war, children of war, superpowered series. I thought I was in for the same song and dance I've seen over and over again. I was surprised to find that this wasn't the case. After the main character is wisped away and his friends are left in the aftermath, the real story begins. The story does a good job of following all characters, and you are given plenty of time to develop an emotional bond to them all. There are not a lot of action filled scenes, but the ones you get are satisfying. It's pacing isn't too slow, but it definitely is never rushed either. All in all it's done really well. 
One thing that I was really impressed with is that some characters started out villainous and then seemed less and less evil as the story progressed. Others started out seemingly ok, but then became more and more villainous. Not one character was ever truly evil, and I felt most were likeable in their own way. As I said, this was  character driven story and it was done extremely well. 
I'll say the artwork and animation were pretty good, but the music and voice acting were top notch. The music was typically right on, and it really fed to the emotion in each scene. They really did a fantastic job. The voice actors hit their mark just about every time and it made for a great experience. 
If you don't mind story/character driven anime series with less action than character development then give this series a look. I thought it was great and would highly recommend it.

    What a disappointment.  I expected a lot out of this show as it was done by BONES but it definitely falls apart at a certain point in the series.   
There were a lot of things that were done well in the show.  The animation was quite beautiful and remained at a high quality all throughout.  The music worked although they repeated some themes one too many times.  The OP is pretty nice although I think others are better.  The concepts they introduced in the first half of the series were quite interesting as well. 
But a ton of problems arose as the series went on.  The characterization was shallow, and this was surprising coming from BONES.  Even at the end of the series, it's hard to sympathize with any of the main characters.  The presentation was dramatic without being able to create any drama because the audience just never learns enough about anyone, even Akiyuki.  The minor characters (especially Ishu and her crew) were there but you never feel like you know them that well either.  When characters cried, I could barely understand why they were crying save for the part about Haru's mother.  The most well-developed character was probably Nakiami, although she had less screentime than Haru.   
Another issue was the world that Xam'd was set in.  There is a war and there's apparently a North side and a South side but it never really matters because it's only ever important in relation to the military experiments with the Xam'd.  I didn't care about any of the &quot;suffering&quot; or people affected by the war because it seemed to be there just to try to make the war more important.  The military also makes a big deal out of the Humanforms, but those are pretty much useless in the grand scheme of things.  In fact, many aspects of the show end up being pretty useless in the grand scheme of things including Ishu's postal ship, Ishu in general, Kakisu, Akiyuki's parents (who are shown in a ridiculous amount of scenes with absolutely no effect), and Raigyo.   
There were so many interesting ideas and concepts, but the strangely dull presentation and slow pacing don't deliver them to their fullest potential.  Everything up until about episode 14 was just fine, but it seems that every decision they made in the plot after that just contributed to less of anything being explained in the series.  In my opinion, they should not have separated Akiyuki and Nakiami for the second half of the show. 
It's bewildering to me how much I ended up disliking a lot of what happened in this series after such a charming first episode and beginning but I suppose BONES just hasn't been too successful with any of their original plots not based on a manga.

    First of all, I am impressed! 
At first this Anime was long gone from my top 10 Anime's. It was good, I liked it ever since the first episodes. This is because Xam'd: Lost Memories really knows how to make itself enjoyable. Putting in effort into the Animation at the correct times; and not doing so at the correct times also. 
However, due to some issues I was unable to see Xam'd: Lost Memories for a while. Then, when two newer episodes came out, I was honestly surprised. The Animation was fluid and looked outstanding, the story was becoming more and more of a build-up, which fits the story perfectly fine. That's because a lot of things still need to be explained. The drama in between sure got me seated at the front of my seat (especially a special son -scene in episode 13), it was terrific.  
Not just that, the music adds up to it and is pretty great. They use a lot of basic sounds; which sucks. But when the music starts kicking in, oh boy, you'll be dragged in! 
But what really got me the most is the cast. For one, the main protagonist is much more like your everyday guy. He's not quiet, he doesn't cry and he doesn't acts like a wimp (heck, a lot of Anime guys act like wimps). But he, Akayuki, though not liked all the time, sure is a fascinating character. The main cast is what interest me the most, and what adds to this story the best. 
They aren't original, they aren't exceptional: but yes, they are incredibly fascinating and add something to the story every episode. I love it, I just love! 
In the years I've watched Anime, I've only given a few Anime's a 9 in overall rating. Never have I given a ten however, and an 8 is already exceptional with me. However, Xam'd, even though it's not finished yet.. deserves a big fat 9 from my part. It just, becomes even better the more you watch it. And I have great expectations of this Anime, I just hope I won't have to come back on my words. 
Watch it, bare with it.. and you'll be dragged into liking it as well. Because even though it isn't 'that' original; it still is one of those Anime I will definitely enjoy watching and that makes me sit at the edge of my seat!

    In order to watch this show, just sit back and take in the visuals. Don't concern yourself with the plot or characters otherwise you'll have nothing to hold onto. 
This is a tremendously creative series set in an intriguing world with beautiful animation. Unfortunately, nothing about the story or characters even comes close to matching the show's outward beauty.  
This isn't a boring show; it constantly shows the viewer new locations, characters, confrontations. Locales include a pleasant island community, Himalayanesque mountains, and much more sumptuous scenery. Character designs are all equally creative from the military uniforms to the Zanbani's rag-tag crew to the various culture's depicted. ""Xam'd"" also earns points from me for some of the most creative monster designs I seen. Every bit of eye candy propels the show briskly through its 26 episodes. 
Beyond that, there is nothing. Those who have seen ""Eureka 7"" will instantly recognize some of the characters and possibly carry over some attachment from that show, but really, ""Xam'd""'s characters are simply hollow pawns to the story. 
A story that is no more intriguing than any of its characters. Honestly, I would be hard-pressed to even give a plot synopsis. There are many good ideas in ""Xam'd,"" none of which are developed to fruition. There's a war; however, I couldn't tell you who was on what side or what the cause was. There are things called Xam'd or hiruko or something; I have no idea what they are after even after watching the show. There are a hundred examples of this.  
This damn thing takes so many directions, incorporates so many details, and continually adds to the fracas that nothing is ever given its proper gestation time. It almost feels like an abridged version of a larger series. 
I still recommend ""Xam'd"" to people who enjoy quality art and good animation; however, don't frustrate yourself with the finer details of the story -they aren't all that fine anyway.

    ""Everyday I wake up thinking it'll be okay. 'Cause you promised me that, you'd come back some day. My heart is throbbing but I will wait. And I'll strive... to stay strong..."" 
Try as I might, I cannot think of a song that matches the content of a series better than the first ED of Xam'd: Lost Memories. If you wanted to, you could probably put these lyrics as the synopsis of the series and have it hold the same effect as the current. 
Xam'd is not a series that everyone will enjoy. At first glance, it would appear to be another action series that people watch to see intense fight scenes and fast pacing. While the action scenes that are included are displayed beautifully, this is not what I, or anyone else, should classify as any other action-adventure. If that is what you are looking for, Xam'd may not be the right fit. 
However, if you want to watch a series that will make you think, or perhaps are looking for a hidden gem that will tug at your heart-strings, you should seriously consider picking this up. It is not fast-paced, and I cannot stress that enough. You have to be able to think and decipher hidden messages in the plot to enjoy Xam'd to its full extent. 
Set in a world where the two major continents, the North and the South, are fighting a bloody war that is beginning to take civilian lives, Xam'd does a brilliant job of displaying the devastation, loss, and beauty of war. The story, while confusing, accurately depicts the fight between two warring factions who both believe are doing the right thing. Let's get this straight. War is NOT simple, and in a world as complex as the one Xam'd is situated in, it is even more complicated.  
I am not going to explain any part of the story in detail, because I believe that one of the major attractions of this series is being able to discover for yourself what is going on. I will say this however; if you find yourself lost, do not hesitate to re-watch certain episodes, especially ones around episode 20, where the story really begins to get serious. The show goes from a more light-hearted mood to very serious rather quickly, and begins leading the viewer down a twisted path where you WILL find yourself lost at least once or twice. But such is a story of love and war. 
Akiyuki, the main protagonist of Xam'd, at first seems like any other shallow MC that the industry spits out 10 times a season. While he is similar to many MC's in the past (Especially Renton Thurston, another one of BONES' brain childs') he has one major thing going for him.  
Akiyuki has a heart, and an undying love for his friends and family, especially his child hood friend, Haru. This heart of Akiyuki's will guide him on a quest across his world to discover why he was chosen to lead a new life as a Xam'd, but to find his passion for the ones he loves.  
If there is one negative aspect of this show, it's that it brings in A LOT of characters, while only truly developing a handful throughout. The three main protagonists are quickly pinned as Akiyuki, Nakiami, and Haru. With them, however, each protagonists brings in more characters that the viewer my find difficult connecting to. 
Akiyuki brings his parents, who get a lot of screen time with most of the development coming with his father.  
Nakiami brings an entire ship full of characters with her, of which, only three (Raigyo, Ishu, and Yango) get a true development to the point where the viewer will connect with them on a certain level. Along with the crew, Nakiami also brings Lady Sannova, the white-haired children, and also her village of Tenjo and Tessik peoples, some of which are not thoroughly explained. The whole religion aspect of the story is an extremely weak point of the story, as it does not truly get proper development.  
Haru brings her family and good friend Naruichi into the story, of which her sister Midori is the only to get a decent level of development. 
The military comes in without a true explanation as well, but the viewer will quickly pin Toujirou and company as the main antagonists of the story. Throughout the show, you will need to re-watch certain parts to be able to understand what exactly the whole military-versus-religion thing is really about. Not until the end will you really be able to understand, so don't fret if you get to around episode 23 and still aren't too positive about what's going on.  
Akiyuki is without a doubt the main character of the show, and a beautiful one at that. On his journey from his home island of Sentan to the Northern continent, he has many struggles to deal with. He handles them quite well, from his love and want to be reunited with Haru, to understanding a war which he has been thrust into unwillingly. You will find a quick connection with Akiyuki, and share his tears, as well as smiles. 
Nakiami, however, is a more difficult character to understand. She goes VERY late into the story without getting a true explanation of who exactly she is, and why exactly she has such a connection with the Xam'ds. She is a character completely shrouded in mystery, but one that will steal your heart regardless. It is tough not to grow to love her as the story progresses, and by the end, you will shed a tear or two if you have watched the series correctly. 
Haru is a girl that has experienced great loss in her life, and with her sudden and even greater loss of Akiyuki, this character will tug at your heart-strings like few characters are able to. You will find yourself rooting for her with every action she takes, and although I will admit I was FUCKING PISSED when she cut her hair (what's with BONES and having female leads cut their hair half way through? First Talho and now this), she was my favorite character when I finished the show.  
These three MC's, as well as the several side characters that get an actual development (Raigyo, Yango, Midori, Ryuzuo, Toujirou) will bring you on a ride that I can guarantee you will not soon forget. 
As beautiful as the story and characters are, it is the sound and animation that really bring this series to life. I am a huge fan of BONES' choices for the OST. The ED's and OP's are awesome, and the music that plays throughout is beautiful and heart-warming.  
The animation is on another level when compared to other series of the same genre. While the character designs are quite unique and vibrant, it is the design of the world as a whole that makes this story beautiful. You will find yourself pausing to admire the amazing detail this studio put into making this series a real winner. 
As the series comes to its end, you may find yourself struggling to hold back a few tears. The ending is beautiful, and I'll admit that even thinking about it clouds my eyes. A word of advice for the ending, Ishu is not rambling some incoherent poem in the background as the final credits begin to roll. Listen to (or in most peoples case, read) what she is saying and pay attention to what is being shown to you. It is only then that the true power of this ending with touch your soul. 
As I said before, Xam'd is not for everyone, but if you close this review with even a slight interest in the story, characters, or art, then please, check out Xam'd: Lost Memories. It is not often that you can find a series as beautiful and moving as the tale of Xam'd, and the opportunity should not be passed up.

    I just finished watching this anime through the second time, and it has great replay value. The story is very intricate and interconnected so don't expect to grasp all of it the first time through, but the overall messages and themes are impressively powerful. It's got action, don't worry. Lots. 
I suppose I'll start with the story first, STORY: 
The beginning of the series is very focused on a few characters, and slowly branches out to include more and more characters in the plot until towards the end all of the characters are being covered but the focus is where it should be. Things start rather slow I think in the beginning, but the other elements really hold it together and make it worth sticking around for. I don't think many people will fully understand the resolution, so the tip I can give you without spoiling the show is to understand Akiyuki's connection to Xam'd. Pretty vague, huh? Well if you really string together various scenes and points of view of many of the characters the entire world really comes together rather complete and stunning. For anyone who likes depth in story I strongly reccomend Xam'd: Lost Memories. It might be a bit unknown in terms of popularity but that's because it's a very character driven story along with many, many scenes in a single episode so the faint of heart might not like the jumps between settings so quickly. Especially when the story crosses dialogue from one character with scenery from someplace completely different. The show has a very individual look on people and life in general, which made the plot intensely likable for me. Don't worry, the ending doesn't upset in my book. 
Next up, PICTURES, lots of em! 
This anime has really fluid and clean animation. The characters move cleanly around and interact with their world on such a personal level you get drawn in very easily. This just makes the fighting scenes much more intense because of the level of detail that's been drawn out in every picture. There's also alot of symbols and objects that have many meanings and connections to the characters making the picture that more meaningful. For example: whenever a character is giving advice or helping someone else they'll often throw something at them and they'll catch it. Pretty nifty bit I thought. Anyhow, the machines and the mechas (I call them bio-mechas) are really interesting and one of a kind looks. They really make the world very alien and yet believable in the context. (All flying machines are powered by stones that create a cool rainbow effect when ships take-off) Don't worry that didn't spoil any plot. The characters expressions are also spot on all the time like most animes, and there's so much interaction in these stunningly beautiful shots of landscapes and skylines that it's hard not to be a little passionate when you write a review on the art style. 
Sorry, did you say SOUND? 
I'll make this one short, since you can't describe sound with words as well. 
Volume: Great! 
Environment: Pretty good! 
Weapons: Satisfying 
The Fwoosh Rainbox Sky-Ship Sounds: FWOOSH!... Tink! 
Voices: Really, really good. 
Disturbing/Strange: Unexpectedly familiar yet different 
Timing: Spot on! 
Who's a CHARACTER? 
All the characters are really dynamic and many of them end up changing towards the end of the show, or coming to some sort of realization. That's what makes this anime really special in my book. All of the characters are pretty dynamic and interactive. The world feels really alive and ever-changing. Sure, there's always characters with flaws, and there's characters that are supporting, and there's ones you see more often. But when you see a character, you'll think of them specifically because they're really well defined. All of them have differences and individual personalities. I could say the only exception is the standard soldier-type person in this show, but that's believable in the context of things. Everyone also gets a bit of the spotlight as the plot goes on, so if you don't see much of a character in the beginning or when you first see them, expect them to show up in the future because the anime pretty even-handed when it comes to show time. (Of course Akiyuki overwhelmingly has the most show time, being the protagonist and all) For those who don't like the vulnerable parts of characters especially, this show isn't for you. One of the main themes is showing the weaknesses in people and how they overcome their flaws. If that isn't a powerful enough message for you I advise moving on to a different review. 
I watched the show twice, I liked the show more the second time I saw it. I probably wouldn't see it a third time because I understand pretty much the whole story now. 
Highlights: 
-Akiyuki growing as an individual through the whole story 
-Akiyuki's parents 
-Midori/Haru 
-Every single fight scene 
-Every single fight scene 2nd viewing 
-Climaxes of secondary character plots 
-Climaxes of secondary character plots (Especially) 
-Revealing of the truth of Xam'd towards the end the 2nd viewing, because I grasped most of the point behind events 
Loved the story 
Loved the animation a bit less, still loved it 
I never focused on the sound because it was so flawless in my book, totally believable 
The characters WERE the story, and I loved the story 
OVERALL First view: 8.5 
OVERALL Second view: 9.5 
Watch this anime! Maybe not twice, but more people should definitely check it out. It's beautiful storytelling on a fast paced and intense level. 
Lil' Note: 
I must warn viewers that if you don't understand what's going on and get lost or confused, you will probably get frustrated with the choices that characters are making, even under their respective personalities. But, if you follow the plot you will really understand why a character does or doesn't do something, or what the heck just happened and where they are you'll love the show by the end, guaranteed. I found this out in my second viewing that I liked the choices characters made the second time through because I fully understood the show and where it was going.

    As many people have already said, this anime is produced by the same people who brought you Eureka 7. Keep that in mind if you plan on watching this anime.  
First off, check out the OP. Holy jebus it's sweet. Catches you instantly, and gets you all excited for what looks (judging from the animation quality) an awesome show. In some respects, this is a let down. While the animation is superb, the soundtrack is hauntingly good, and the characters are generally quite fleshed out (just enough info for you to find them interesting)... the story is near random. This anime seems confused as to what it's trying to say. On the one hand, we are basically following Akiyuki on his journey becoming a Xam'd, which is done quite well in terms of painting a comprehensive picture of the trials he endures.  
Then it falls apart. The world as it is presented is split into two warring hemispheres, with some kinda naturalist &quot;Tessik&quot; tribe caught in the middle. No justification is ever given for this war, and for some unknown reason the Tessik are ostracized by everybody. As the series progresses, I was torn. In some regards, it's amazing: The characters are brought to life fully. You understand their hopes and dreams, and why they may be sabotaging their own attempts to reach them. In other regards, it's confusing and disappointing: Things keep happening to Akiyuki with no background reason, and the whole concept of a Xam'd is some kind of forbidden topic. Also, side stories seem to be the order of the day. A LOT of episodes are devoted to Nakiami's side trips, where she always seems to be preventing some poor sap from being engulfed by the Xam'd in him. (They also never explain the nature of a Xam'd... that's for you to decide. And good luck figuring out what the deal is with Human-form weapons...) 
Conclusions? Well, it was a fun series to watch, but you'll get MUCH more out of it if you focus on a character driven storyboard. Pay attention to character interactions over actual plot, and you'll be much more satisfied. Otherwise you'll end up like me, wishing the creators had decided to actually make the 50 odd episodes that would have barely been sufficient to explain the story they threw at you, instead of cramming way to many (admittedly interesting) ideas into a mere 26 eps. Bottom line: If you found Eureka 7 too slow, but liked the ideas... you'll have a good time with Xam'd: Lost Memories. But you'll still wind up with a couple wtf moments and an abrupt ending.

    Recently people have been arguing whether Go Nagai (Getter Robo, Mazinger Z ) can only make giant robots shows. For the most part, they’re right, he can’t do anything other than robot shows well when shows like Kekko Kamen were created under his name. That does not mean that Go Nagai can not create shows that are entertaining as hell like Demon Lord Dante. 
            The plotline to Demon Lord Dante starts off with a bunch of crazy cultists who try to revive the titular Dante. The protagonist of this series, Ryo begins to have several weird nightmares involving sacrificing. Later on, the cultists decide to take his useless, damsel in distress of a sister, Saori as a sacrificial lamb. After a few pointless events, Ryo gets possessed by Dante and can turn into an odd demonic creature at will. From then on, the series just takes a Go Nagai twist. Incest, sacrifice, violence, anything you’ve ever known about Go Nagai happens. One of the most interesting points in the series is introduced when the first of appearance of GOD occurs. It turns out GOD is an evil, evil dude and hates everyone in humanity. What is it with Nagai and God that they just can’t get along? In one of the Getter Robo installments, one of the robots beats the heck outta God. The thing about Demon Lord Dante, is you can’t take this seriously. Honestly you can add an exclamation point after every sentence when you explain what Demon Lord Dante is about. This series really isn’t for religious nuts, and it really would be boring to those who don’t care for Nagai. It’s a relatively boring anime unless you see it in the mindset of a comedy and not a horror. 
The artwork and character designs of DLD look like stock Nagai character designs. The main character, Ryo looks exactly like Koji Kabuto from Mazinger Z. As far as the supporting cast, there really is no one of interest to stand out. The main point of the series would be the demons. Most of the demons are not terrifying, but they do leave an impression. The eerie eyes, big mouths, large wings and huge height tend to make the series pretty creepy. Add in the fact that they’re fighting God and you’ll for sure need to go to church this Sunday (ff you’re an immoral Catholic like me). 
 The soundtrack to this is almost nonexistent. I don’t recall any of the songs adding anything good or bad to the series. The only notable part is the song by Tomozaku Seki which confidently tells you to “RELEASE YOUR MIND” which is what you should do to watch this. The dub is extremely flat and it sounds like everyone has become fatigued of being in the studio. I really can’t speak for the Japanese track since I spot checked it because the dub added a certain spice to it for being so bland. 
 As far as characters go, they all do ridiculous things to move the plot along. Ryo is a character that you would be  
screaming “don’t go there!” because of his stupid decisions. Saori, Ryo’s sister as I stated before is just a useless character who is only meant to be sacrificed and kidnapped. She becomes so useless that her father actually sacrifices her. That’s right folks, before long before Shou Tucker of Fullmetal Alchemist fame, this man betrayed his daughter. 
Overall, this is a series meant for Go Nagai fans who can understand what this is and Mexicans like myself. No, that is not racist, it just so happens that this show has a cult following in Mexico. The horror is weak, the character designs are stock, and the story is ridiculous. There’s a reason why the director Mitsutaka Noshitani never got work as a head director again. That doesn’t mean this show is throwaway. It’s still decently entertaining when you show this to a very religious person who would accuse you of blasphemy for showing them Demon Lord Dante.

    Pretty good for an older anime. Story has creepy elements similiar to Doomed Megalopolis and Devilman. Action is good at times. Violence is fairly well done, although not too gorey. Odd concept is what comes to my mind when I think of this one and that is why I didn't resell it. Kinda boring in parts and whole story would have been better if it only had 9 or 10 episodes.

    I think the audio might be a bit de-synced, it's actually interesting plus it short. 
Pros: A good story with good sounds. 
Cons: Nothing really, it's short and sweet. 
~SPOILERS~ 
A headmaster reminisces about a cruelty(killing a beached whale) that he witnessed as a child. Now as the headmaster he sees the same thing happen, he decides to do what he can. It is worth a mention this looks like a Greenpeace initiative. Worth a watch. 
How can i write a longer review when this episode. It seriously is a single episode there's nothing to write about and this bullshit minimum verbiage is stupid. This is getting ridiculous sometimes there's not much to say on a recap episode, that everyone would've seen watching the series.(8)

    Okay. This is a short made for greenpeace about why we should save the whales because they once saved us. Pretty presumptuous and annoying message (Worthwhile/good messages[1] should be easy to understand. Re-read what I said...what the fuck, right?) It almost makes me want to begin eating meat. 
But the animation--Koji Yamamura's style-- is nice and it's really hard to become irritated with something in the span of two minutes. So it's not so bad.  
If I repeatedly watched it 3 or 4 times I would definitely lower the score 2-3 points. 
---- 
See _Princess Mononoke_ if you're really into this stuff. That one is much more enjoyable and has  much nicer pictures to look at. 
[1] Well they should, like, be applicable to everyone too... The whole metaphor is kind of bullshit. I think the target audience is Japanese people who ate whales due to starvation ??? I'm not really cultured enough to know if that demographic is big or not. I don't care. I've never even seen a fucking whale.  
I guess I should lower my score?

      Once again Yamamura Koji uses is talents to teach us to conserve rather than be greedy. One of his lightest work, I feel it is also one of his best in terms of the animation and especially because of the marvelous transitions which are so very unique and wonderful to his style! 
The characters definitely have a similar look and feel to those from Inaka Isha except they drawn three shades lighter and have had the world's weight taken off their shoulders. Gone are worries of freezing Soviet-Europe and sickness - this is a film about saving, not trading lives.  
This is a truly Yamamura Koji film if there ever was one and while there isn't a trace of Noh in it, it almost feels MORE like him because of it. I feel as though I could really appreciate his animation style in this piece because it was such a simple message given with such a simple delivery: Please save the whales.  
Never was there a finer advertisement to be found.

    These short episodes came with the original videos and star Amano and Noriko as they educate the viewer on the science and history of their universe. Episodes are devoted to the science behind warping, the Space Monsters, and other topics with the average two minute running time utilized well. The scientific explanations can get surprisingly dense, but following them isn't exactly rewarding as some or all of what it says is going to be fictional. Still, the care that has gone into these explanations is admirable and makes the Gunbuster world more respectable. Hideaki Anno would go on to combine super robot and real robot concepts in Neon Genesis Evangelion. 
These shorts didn't make me like Gunbuster any more than I did before but they're worth a watch and have a few silly moments.

    Chibis jumping up and down, talking about hard core scientific facts is the last thing to expect..if  this wasn't Anno's work.  
This little extra paves the way nicely for the series both for factual and fictional background. It's a clever way to keep the series tidy of unending explanations and surely saves space in its short running time.

    Oh yeah. This. This is a thing I watched. What the fuck is it, right? It's actually a Hirohiko Araki adaptation of a manga before he wrote JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The OVA is about 45 minutes and the manga itself spans a multi-generational, genre-hopping, epic two volumes so I assume the OVA is full and faithful. With that in mind, we have reason to be disappointed here. There is little of the eccentric creativity or style to remind you of anything Araki. The only reason you'd have to expect he was involved is that dogs are beat and shot in the first five minutes. 
In Baoh, a teenager after an accident is turned into a bio-weapon by a secret organization. Another captive of the organization, a little girl with psychic powers, inadvertently frees the guy as she tries to escape. It turns out a parasite inside of Ikurou gives him the ability to turn into a primal creature uncannily similar to Beast from X-Men that has super strength, sharp claws, and can generate electricity. Ikurou and Sumire escape together and are on the lam from the Doress organization, and soon have to take the fight to them. 
Baoh is a barren story and setting. It feels like the foundation for something that should've grown more extravagant and detailed, like a pilot manga. Whether this was one or not, even the basic concept doesn't feel fresh. Transforming bio-weapon mutant is a cliche in and of itself, and Baoh's standard abilities never grow to anything beyond what they seem at a glance. The action scenes, of which there are many, lack the pieces necessary to make compelling set pieces or combat. Baoh dispatches all of his rivals with total ease and almost purely brute force, allowing for that B-movie kind of violent 90s OVA with a ton of exploding heads and gore. Even when it comes to being weird and unnecessarily violent, the appeal of a lot of these pulp OVAs, Baoh is fairly tame and the exploding head trick is about all it has to show. The antagonists have no goal other than to bury their Baoh experiment and use it to gain world influence, and certain characters having psychic abilities is never explained or related to the Baoh project in any way. This little girl has visions she can use to foresee events, and that's all there is to it. We know nothing about our heroes other than they don't want to be captured by Doress, which is completely expected. 
Production values are fine. It looks better than your average series, but not by much. I noticed some reused head shots and still backgrounds which are the kind of thing I normally hope to not see in an OVA (or anywhere), but motion is fluid and I didn't spot any obvious low frame rates. Background music is a lot of that completely stock squeal ""tense"" ambiance and electro rock 'n roll when Baoh goes on the attack. In conclusion, I don't think there's any reason to recommend this. It doesn't conform to people's expectations of Araki, the violence isn't that extreme even if you're a ""gorehound"", and it doesn't have much of that camp appeal due to how straightforward and natural of a story it is.

    So, I read the baoh manga a couple months before watching this, and overall, I found it kinda average. Nothing really special, but I certainly wouldn't call it bad. I decided to forget about and, until I found this. And... I'm a bit disappointed. Baoh is still really awesome, and I'd say if there's any reason to watch this, It'd be to just watch him be awesome. But it was also really short. I mean, the manga was pretty short too, but the ova just cut so much out, the whole thing went by too quickly. I'd give it a higher score if I got to see more of Baoh, but I'd say just read the manga if you're interested.

    Rate:5 
English Dubbed

*note:'_' is intended to not give out spoilers 
Bland and simple. An experiment that rises up when the chance presents itself. Story has some logic failures. Such as if the ____ works on brain eventually it will run out of brain. So how can you say a prolonged life? 
Nicely drawn. Animations are done well. Art is different then what the cover picture shows(depending which picture you are looking at here). Works well with the story. 
Subtitles don't work well with English dubbed. The actors either use different words or the time is off. Better off keeping the subtitles off. Some, i would say about 1 percent of the spoken language is muffled. Which means makes sure to use the subtitles when needed to figure out what was said. 
Is mostly driven on the main male character. As for the main female character her bio is moderate. For example her origin is iffy. 
Mad scientist lovers would likely like this.

    Only a few minutes into this OVA and there is already a scene where dogs are brutally mudered... yup this is without a doubt a story written by Hirohiko Araki! If you're a fan of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, you may already know Baoh from JJBA Allstar Battle, because he was a DLC character in this game. 
The plot is pretty straightforward and without many twists: this anime is about a young man who has the so called Baoh parasite in his body. This allows him to transform in some sort of monster that looks like it's straight from Thundercats. He escapes from a facility and meets a girl with physic powers on his way. They encounter a lot of bad guys that Baoh has to slaughter and in end he fights a strong enemy, so they bring some shounen elements into the mix too. 
This OVA is pretty gory, so if you like to see a monster killing people and melting their faces, then Baoh Raihouska might be for you. Like I said the plot isn't really all that special and since this anime is only 47 minutes long, there isn't much character developement. The action was good and the artstyle was nice to look at (it doesn't really resemble JoJo's Bizarre Adventure though). Some things bothered me though: the girl's physic power really didn't add anything to the plot at all. Why did she even have a special power in the first place? It felt really random. Also the ending was kind of weird too. Overall Baoh Raihousha is no masterpiece, but for what it is, it's definately pretty enjoyable.

    Story 6/10 
Ikuro Hashiwaza was turned into a weapon by the Doress Laboratory. He escapes with Sumire, a girl who possesses psychic abilities. Join them as they try to escape the clutches of the Doress Laboratory. 
Man, this story had many things going for it. It just...fell flat. I wanted to see more. I really don't know how to describe it. 
Art 7/10 
I had animation issues here. Like, in some scenes, when they talked, their ""mouth movement"" weren't in sync. I mean, it is a 80s anime, so I can understand why there was some issues, but it still bothered me nonetheless (I guess you can say it really bothered me). 
Sound 6/10 
The music choice isn't all great. I-I just don't know what to say. 
Character 6/10 
The only characters we pretty much get development are Ikuro and Sumire. Their interactions are great, but then when it comes to the villains, it's so one-dimensional. Like, I wanted them to explore Dorress's past more. Like, why are they doing this? What are their motives for creating a weapon? It really wasn't made clear. I wish they explored more of that. 
Enjoyment 6/10 
I honestly cannot say this was a good experience, but I can't say it was the worse either. I mean, the action is cool and it had something going when it came to the story, I just think it didn't quite came together well. 
Overall 6/10 
Personally, I wouldn't recommend this anime. But, if you're curious to know what it's about and all of that, then give it a try. If you only care about action, then you won't mind this. 
Thanks for reading. Let me know your thoughts on this review and any feedback you may have for me. Until next time!

    Now this is a great OVA and does not disappoint. You may recognise some similarities to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. That's because this was Araki's first to use his signature gore (the guy who made JoJo). 
Starting at a confusing beginning, everything is soon explained. Although not much is revealed about the main character's characteristics. It is great for a short story. 
The battles are unlike anything I've seen from a superhero anime. When this ended, I was left wanting more. 
There isn't much else I can say about this other then to watch it. 
It's great for all sorts of fans, it's got a Superhero, Gory fights, Horror, Science Fiction, Cyborgs and Espers.

    This anime has a lot of flaws, and I mean A LOT, but somehow, I can't get myself do dislike it. In my quest for 80's and 90's GAR anime I stumpled upon this great short OVA, and since I like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, I thought I might like this. I was right. 
The story itself is very eh. The way it's being told is very rushed, which is to be expected from a 50-ish minute OVA, but it was still entertaining to me, though not that good. 
The art was, in my opinion, probably the best part of this. It was in short terms, pretty damn good. Very Araki-styled. 
The characters are sort of bland and generic, but still lovable. Don't expect to be very connected emotionally to any of them, they're mostly just fun to watch. 
Even though it has it's flaws. Baoh the Visitor was so fun to watch. Really a sort of guilty pleasure anime. I really enjoyed this, but because of it's clear flaws, I can't give it a higher score than 7/10.

    English: 
First of all, yes, it's from the creator of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 
Personally I decided to see Baoh on the basis that he was the creator of Jojo's, I did not really want it, but although if his start is a little loose, the movie I finish liking quite a bit. 
Story: The story begins and does not tell you what is happening, later you discover why things are wrong, but the story is not the most interesting of the film, but I would have wished it to explain itself more. 
Art / Animation: The film is 89, so I can not demand much, okay, it is noted that they strived to keep Araki's drawing style as much as possible, which until the arrival of David Productions did not fit so well . 
Sound: Every time I started an action scene I sounded to the music that sounded in the ancient fighting arches, it was not bad, it gave a touch of emotion to the scene, otherwise I miss it a little, serious average The right word. Except Ending, that was fine. 
Characters: The characters are the worst of the movie, each and every one is flat, not that this bad and that damages the movie, but I would have liked more immersion of the characters, but it is only a movie and does not want to waste time In the characters to show more action. 
Enjoy: The film is quite enjoyable, it is very entertaining, I do not remember having comedy scenes, it is ok, since although they could, the story does not give much comedy, personally I say I liked it more than I should since I know Jojo's beforehand, but I have to say that even if you do not know Jojo's you might like it, my advice is to see Jojo's (David Production versions) and then see Baoh. 
Overall: Baoh is a good movie, not well known, but worth seeing, and more if you're a fan of Araki's works, and even if you're not giving this movie a chance it will not hurt you. If I give it an 8/10 even though in the other points none exceeded 7 points, it is because even with everything I have I like and I get excited with every fight, which has not happened much, that 8 more than anything It is by myself, if I were serious I would be a 7. 
PS: It has its touch GORE and there is a character that reminds me of Hokuto No Ken, if you do not know Araki is a fan of that series. Baoh is one of Araki's early works before Jojo's, and yet the series is good and it shows that even before Jojo's was a great writer. 
Español: 
Primero que todo, si,  es del creador de Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 
Personalmente decidí ver Baoh a base de que era del creador de Jojo's, no le tenia muchas ganas, pero aunque su inicio es algo flojo, la película me termino gustando bastante. 
Historia: La historia empieza y no te dice que esta pasando, tiempo después descubres el por que de las cosas, esta mal hecho, pero la historia no es lo mas interesante de la película, pero hubiera deseado que se explicara mas a si misma. 
Arte/Animación: La película es del 89, así que no le puedo exigir mucho, esta bien, se nota que se esforzaron por mantener lo mas posible el estilo de dibujo de Araki, lo cual hasta la llegada de David Productions no quedaba tan bien. 
Sonido: Cada vez que empezaba una escena de accion me sonaba a la música que sonaba en los árcades de lucha antiguos, no esta mal, la daba un toque de emoción a la escena, por lo demás lo pase un poco por alto, promedio seria la palabra adecuada. Excepto el Ending, eso estaba bien. 
Personajes: Los personajes son lo peor de la Película, todos y cada uno son planos, no es que este mal y que eso dañe la película, pero me hubiera gustado mas inmersión de los personajes, pero es solo una película y no quiere perder tiempo en los personajes para así mostrar mas acción. 
Disfrute: La película se disfruta bastante, es muy entretenida, no recuerdo que tenga escenas de comedia, esta bien, ya que aunque podrían, la historia no da para mucha comedia, en lo personal digo que me gusto mas de lo que debería ya que de antemano conozco a Jojo's, pero he de decir que aun si no conoces a Jojo's tal vez te guste, mi consejo es que veas Jojo's (las versiones de David Production) y que después veas Baoh. 
En general: Baoh es una buena película, no muy conocida, pero vale la pena ver, y mas si eres fan de los trabajos de Araki, y aun si no lo eres darle una oportunidad a esta película no te hará daño. Si le doy un 8/10 aun cuando en los demás puntos ninguno supero los 7 puntos, es por que aun con todo lo que tiene me gusto y me emocione con cada pelea, lo que hace mucho no pasaba, eso 8 mas que cualquier cosa es por mi mismo, si fuera enserio seria un 7. 
PD: Tiene su toque GORE y hay un personaje que me recuerda a Hokuto No Ken, si no lo sabes Araki es fan de esa serie. Baoh es uno de los primeros trabajos de Araki antes de Jojo's, y aun asi la serie es buena y se nota que aun antes de Jojo's ya era un gran escritor.

    *This review contains spoilers* 
My quest to review more obscure, terrible anime continues with Baoh. Yes, I am aware other critics online have already pointed out Baoh's...flaws, but very few people on this site seem to be aware of it. Allow me to remedy the situtation. I first learned about Baoh after attending an anime convention where there was panel called ""If this is voice acting, then I'm a banana"".  
Story and characters: 1/10 
To say that Baoh has generic story and characters would be the understatement of the century! A mad scientist creates the ultimate living weapon, but the weapon named Baoh escapes and must flee the evil scientist with the help of a cute little girl and her magical animal sidekick! Baoh essentially is like a darker version of a saturday morning American cartoon from the 1980s. This show is very awkwardly paced and even more ineptly cut. I will give the reviewer ""Bennet the Sage"" credit for actually counting that it takes Baoh 53 fucking seconds to slowly limp away while the assassin after Baoh simply stands there and does absolutely nothing. Where Baoh ""shines"" is with its absolutely wretched dub and bad habit of stating the obvious. This has the worst use of expositional dialogue I have ever seen in my life! A character will open a door and another character will awkwardly state"" Dear lord, character A just opened a door!"" I think the dialogue for Baoh was created with 2 assumptions: firstly that the audience is blind, and secondly that the audience is mentally handicapped. 
Art: 3/10 
The art is at least somewhat decent considering the age of this anime. However, it wasn't exactly good even for its time. At least it looks awesome and hilarious when Baoh melts people's faces off! 
Soundtrack: 3/10 
Its just the same soundtrack from every low budget, shit OVA brought overseas during the 1980s. 
Entertainment: 8/10 
""BAOH has a LASER cannon!"" - actual line spoken by a character seconds before being shot with a laser cannon. He then monologues on how cool the attack was while he bleeds out and dies! 
Baoh is hilarious! It has been a few years since I first saw this one with my buddy and there will still be random times when one of us yells the classic line and the other cracks up laughing! Mankind must always remember: BAOH has a LASER cannon!!!"" 
This is a HORRIBLE anime, but it is in fact quite enjoyable for that reason. If you love old, silly, and stupid anime than Baoh is your dream come true. follow the link and skip to 42:30 to witness one of the greatest moments in the history of anime!

    Hello, Visk here and today I will be clearing up this misconception about how this masterpiece has been misrepresented in the other reviews here. 
I love Baoh. I truly do. The world seems to also. I've been told that this OVA was the basis for how alchemy worked in the critically acclaimed series FMA. I've also been told that it was also the inspiration for the T800 Robot in Terminator. In many ways this OVA is superior to the aforementioned titles but due to its short run time and lack of exposure critics nitpick just because they are worried someone else will see through their clever ruse that I've seen through. I will now tell you the truth the others are to scared to tell you. Sure it is flawed but this is a real gem compared to the shit that comes out every season nowadays. 
 (Note: The same Mango Farmer that made Jojo wrote the source material for this.) 
[PART 1: THE STORY] 
There was once a parasite, no not the maxim one, and this said parasite was named Baoh. The parasite infects our main character's love interest. Said love interest gains the ability to become blue and that entitles gaining the ability to be baller like a Smurf or the ""I'm Blue"" guys. The evil people are jealous of his baller status and loli girlfriend so they set out to kill him. That is what you get at the start of this riveting story. I personally think this one of the most engaging and relatable stories I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. There is literally no way this could have gone in any other way than sheer perfection. I was told by a friend that the production of this show was done in a five year long orgy that only ended because the decade was about to end. 
[PART 2: THE ART & ANIMATION] 
For something that came out in 1989 it looks brilliant but the problem comes in when all your amazing characters are dwarfed by Col. Dordo. There just was not enough screen time for this glorious hunk of man and machine. Stan Lee also agrees with as Cyborg is pretty much a wannabe of the power that Dordo holds. Marvel makes Cyborg's enemies laughably weak compared to man that Dordo faces. He takes on the last Indian on Earth while Cyborg fights some skinny bitch boys who die in one hit. To our knowledge Baoh is invincible. Now, you are wondering why I rated it so high but the reason for that is that Dordo made it worth the money and the fights were as smooth as Bruce Willis's bald head. With that out of the way I will now continue onto the next segment. 
[PART 3: CHARACTERS] 
This show suffers from the fact that Dordo wasn't the main character. The world spoke and now we know that the only true flaw this show has is that there isn't more Dordo. It is a paradox because of the fact that Dordo exists the characters are instantly a 10/10 but the fact that he isn't the main character warrants this section a 0/10; so to be fair to the show I will give the characters a 2/10. Better luck next time Pierrot. 
I will end this with an overwhelming recommendation that you should watch it and then tell 5 friends to watch and repeat and repeat and repeat etc. This saved anime way before your French Killers and your Attacking Titans ever tried to. You will not regret giving this 46 minute masterpiece a shot. The end has to be one of the most memorable I have seen in any piece of media. 
Visk here and I'm signing out.  
I hope you enjoy the show.

    If you like your anime complete with exploding heads, melting flesh, dismemberment, and blood spilled by the liter, then look no further.  BAOH is a visual orgasm of blood and violence.  Of course if you also want an interesting story and characters that don’t look like they were stolen from other movies and stereotypes then you should probably not waste your time with this piece of crap. 
Our story starts with a young girl Sumire being chased through a train by the henchmen of an evil organization we later learn is called Doress.  Apparently this group kidnaps and uses people with various supernatural and mystic powers and also experiments on people, turning them into super powered monsters for military applications.  Sumire stumbles on one of their experiments and during her escape, the man called Baoh escapes along with her.  His real name is Ikuroo, and together they run from the Doress organization as they send out various assassins to kill them. 
It could be an interesting story but it isn’t.   The plot is never adequately presented, providing only the scantest amount of back-story in between the sequences of gore.  The blood and violence level is completely over the top.  Unless you just love heads being exploded or bodies being cleaved and dismembered then you’re in heaven.  But that’s all there is to the action.  The action scenes just aren’t that interesting or exciting.  Baoh seemingly comes up with a new ability whenever he needs it (conveniently named and displayed on the screen as if I cared to know) and he never uses the same one more than once.  The climactic battle at the end is really...anti-climatic.   
The characters are boring and uninspired.  Sumire and Ikuroo are given brief backgrounds but nothing that is even remotely interesting.  The drama over Ikuroo being consumed by the monster he transforms into is poorly developed and might have been of interest to me.  The various villains are really where this show fails miserably.  Besides all of them being silly, they all look and feel like rip-offs from other sources.  There’s a cyborg soldier who looks like the Terminator but most amusingly at the end is the ridiculous clichéd Native American, Walken.  He has a big ""W"" on his belt buckle in case you forget his name. 
Artwork and animation is also extremely substandard.  The character designs are not that good and look extremely dated or like knockoffs of other movies.  Sumire is the only exception and I kind of liked the way she looked.  Most of the detail went into animating gore and melting faces and other body parts.  Even this isn’t that good.  The musical score is typical 80s electric disco and is almost comical to listen too. 
In the end BAOH is an experience that should be missed by all but the most hardcore fans of gore anime.  Unless you are just really feeling nostalgic for 80s anime or thought Power Rangers was good programming, I can’t recommend this title.  If you want to torture yourself with something crappy watch something that at least looks good.

    This series uses a predominantly soothing style of simplistic animation, bright colors, and comforting stereotypes, punctuated by expressions of angst, alienation, and philosophical musing.  The simplistic, iconic animation style and anime cliches are subverted by the sharp insights into how shallow stereotypes can be. 
This is a comedy show with a very painful and peaceful twist.  This is the black comedy of a writer who is alienated and shocked by the inhumanity of everyday hypocrisy, but who nonetheless remains calm and sane and socially acceptable. 
For a contrast, check out &quot;Welcome to the N.H.K.&quot; which is equally existential and dark but a lot less mentally balanced.

    Please let me introduce Guu; Guu is a creature of (probably) female gender, possibly of the human species and is perhaps around the age of ten. She is the single most disturbing character in any anime I have ever seen. I kid you not, she is stranger than the entire cast of Baccano combined. It is quite interesting to see how an entire series become worth watching for a single character, though I lie, for Guu to work Hare must exist. They are complete opposites of eachother, Hare being the responsible, level headed, over thinking nice guy while Guu is possibly the devil personified, a creature only true to her own self, doing things randomly and more often than not for her own saddistic pleasure. In many ways she resembles a cat. Cats are not really very nice animals, they don't really care about you as opposed to dogs (which I guess is an animal as good as any other to describe Hare) who are loyal to the brink of the other side of being stupid (which means they passed stupid a long time ago and are now in the twilight zone on the other side of stupidity, many of you must know what it looks like). 
As I have blown Guu's horn for a while now, I shall continue to do so, she is boss. I kid you not, you will like her and because of that you will like this series even though the events that take place in this anime and the two before are often parodies of clichés but become clichés themselves which is pretty much a hit and/or miss thing for the viewers, some things are funny others are not. 
Jungle wa Itsumo Hare nochi Guu FINAL is the third increment of the Hare + Guu collection, it is also the best animated one of the three, perhaps KyoAni's involvement had something to do with that, I personally hope KyoAni were used as slaves for various lecherous acitivities during the making of this anime, but chanes are they were just doing key animation (damn) but despite KyoAni's many, many, many flaws, they can infact draw and animate. 
The opening for this third increment is not as good as the two beforehand, however the ending theme for Final is simply the best and should be enjoyed after each and every episode. 
Thank you for reasing this, I don't really care for opinions unless you agree with me.

    Surprise, surprise - this was quite a bit of fun!   
A small, neglected police task force is given the job of trying to stop a crime wave by a mwah-hah-hah-style eeeeeevil gang headed by an eeeevil mastermind and lots of powersuit mechas causing all sorts of damage.  Conventional methods don't work, so they decide to audition to hire an idol singer to distract the public.     
And it turns out their choice, the shy, naive, demure, young Maron, just happens to be ridiculously strong.  Not only does she wipe the floor with the bad guys, she also become the nation's top idol in the process.   
Okay, okay, the idea is pretty damn stupid.  But that's kind of the point.  This is a HUMOR show, where they are mixing in police drama with idol singers with mecha with the aforementioned eeeeevil antagonist.  It's all for laughs.  Think Prefectural Earth Defense Force.     
I like the more-cartoony-style character designs, that suit the humor well.  I like when they break the fourth wall (and usually I don't).  I like the completely-out-of-place sponsor commercial in the middle of the show -- 100% live action to boot.  It all seems to work.   
This is just a little bit of fun, worth the watching.

    A well made parody anime mocking its fellows from years before, it takes a well thought out and wicked jab at genres like the simpleminded heroine, evil organizations and small task forces dedicated to fighting them in place of the normal police, super human and mecha anime, drunken but heart of gold head of staff, a department full of misfits, all of them steryotypes that get a good ribbing out of this show. 
They break the 4th wall and make a mockery of advertisement and product placement in such a blatant way, that its actually effective! 
Its definitely light hearted, and basic story line, several more in depth plot lines were hinted at but since it was cut to a 2 episode miniseries everything was pretty much left out if it wasn't going to be finished in those 2 episodes. 
Classic late 80's early 90's style humor and the animation is surprisingly good for a low budget short run at the time it was made. 
I recommend it for people who are fans of the classic light humor anime of the era. 
But dont think that just because its a joke its not well written, the characters stand out and I found myself feeling for the main character quickly, all of them develop well, even in so short a show. 
Much lighter of a story than Masami Yuki's typical stuff, but if you like comedy, or are into Masami Yuki's work, and are in the mood for something on the lighter side, then give it a try. 
This is one of those not to well known gems that I have come to realize, I was damn lucky to have picked it up all those years ago. I still bring it out to show friends when they haven't seen it themselves.

    Before I saw Blue Submarine No. 6.  I remember watching a very similar anime.  The basic similarity was in that both shows feature prominently an indefeatable battleship, and an equally indefatigable crew.  However, Shin Kaitei Gunkan is different in that it is significantly older, and other historical themes play a more important role.  For example, the titular submarine, is a symbol of Japanese nationalism during World War II, in the same way, that the antagonist's battleship, the Liberty, is an expression of perceived American imperialism.  In any case, despite these strong echoes from the past, it is a highly enjoyable experience, although one that is short-lived, and inconclusive, leading one to wonder whether the conflict with the Mu was resolved at all.

    I started looking into this special shortly after finishing the series hoping to get a little more content in before officially moving away from Ben-To. 
I very much enjoyed the series and had good expectations for this special, but was gravely disappointed with what I got from it. 
You begin this special with Ume's bit on photos taken of her during a sports event. As expected of an elitist personality, you will see her in her usual mood as she discovers suggestive shots of nothing but her when a photographer was instructed to take pictures of a sports event for the school. She is harsh, snaps in her usual way and gives off the vibe that you are nothing more than a piece of shit. She basically does nothing but drag this on in a 7 minute duration. A slight twist does come in toward the end, but nothing to make up for what was already a plain and uninteresting series of events from the start. If you were not a big fan of Ume, unless it was in a yuri scene, you may dislike her even more in this special. 
The next part consists of ramblings from Oshiroi and her yaoi-filled fantasies of Satou. While it was definitely enjoyable seeing her go into that crazed state when she starts digging into her novel, this kind of thing can only be enjoyed for a short time, and attempting to drag it out through a period of 8 minutes can very easily tone down whatever it had going for it initially. There will be times where she changes her tone and livens up the atmosphere for a short period of time, but the moments in between were just too long to enjoy something like this. 
I would only recommend this to you if you had a strong desire to hear more of Ochiroi's voice or maybe a few insults and beatings from Ume. But don't have the train of thought I did and expect some kind of fight scene or possibly some ecchi fanservise, it just isn't there.

    This came out in 07 and ended in 08, which is honestly surprising to me since I thought it was earlier, and for what it is and only seeing the English dub for it this wasn't bad. Being dubbed by 4kids would send people away usually, but actually sitting down and watching this really helped me to see that 4kids wasn't a BAD thing since it did bring a lot of anime to places where it isn't regularly around at that time and making good memories to look back on.  
This series is one of the good ones to look back on because the dialogue is pretty good, you get to learn about dinosaurs that aren't brought up by other famous things, you get a reminder that this was a card game as well that fell under (like Chaotic), both uses of animation in it is good, and it has two seasons for you to sit through and when it's funny I hope you'll see it too. The ending is pretty typical for this kind of anime though and there are recurring jokes, one in particular that I fucking hate. Watch it or don't, this show is on Netflix and ready for anyone to view at other places available and I'm done.

    Kids love dinosaurs, every kid goes through a phase where they think dinosaurs are the coolest things ever and dream about becoming a paleontologist when they grow up. Usually this happens between six and seven years old and that's definitely who this anime was made for. I don't hate this anime, but unless you're a little kid I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone. The reason I wanted to watch this anime was because I loved it as a kid, but I never finished it so I wanted to see how it ended. 
All of the action in this anime is watching dinosaurs fight, which I know sounds great, but  the animation for these dinosaurs is so bad that they look like they're made of plastic and aren't even hurting each other. Furthermore, a lot of the dinosaurs in the show look alike i.e. some I can only tell apart because one's a different color than the other, I know all of the dinosaurs in the anime are based on actual dinosaurs but that shouldn't be an excuse. However, one thing that does give the anime a little variety is how there are different moves the dinosaurs can use i.e. some can shoot lighting and others can breathe fire. 
As for the story; the anime, at least season 1, is extremely episodical and every episode follows the same formula. The D-Team gets an alert that a new dinosaur card has appeared, they go to where the card is which can be anywhere on Earth, they fight the Alpha Gang who also want the card, the D-Team wins and walks away with the new card. However, the episodes do have some connection to each other. The grand question that kind of drags through the anime is ""where did the cards come from"" and of course it's one of those plot devices where you don't get an answer until the end of the anime.  
Season 2 is divided into about 5-episode long story arcs. I actually like Season 1 better than 2 because in Season 2 I feel like the story arcs just drag on way too much while at least in Season 1 every episode is self-contained. However, in Season 2 the plot gets a lot more complex which is good. 
As for the characters; the main characters, Max, Rex, and Zoey, have nothing unique about them! They're everything you're expecting; they're kind hearted, brave, selfless, and all they want to do is protect the dinosaurs. What I hate about them most is how the plot for a lot of episodes revolves around these little-kid problems they have i.e. in one episode Zoey didn't like the guy her older sister was dating and in another Rex's dinosaur partner Ace is afraid of water. My favorite characters are definitely the Alpha Gang. They remind me so much of Team Rocket from Pokemon; the Alpha Gang are some of the most incompetent villains ever! In every episode they always either get electrocuted, blown up, set on fire, or are victims of some kind of horrible accident and they never get the dinosaur card! I just love watching them fail over and over again! Also, I love how eccentric Max, Rex, and Zoey's parents are, ironically they don't get much screen time.  
Overall: Only watch this anime if you're a little kid and you love dinosaurs because this isn't a short anime that you can knock out in a few hours, it takes a while to go through every episode. Honestly, I'm glad I'm finally done with this anime, but I'm happy I pushed through to the end because the ending was very satisfying. My advice to anyone looking at this anime is to just watch Pokemon, it's way better and there's a lot of similarities.

    Welcome to Digimon… I mean Dinosaur King. For real though, We have three protagonists… two guys and one girl, who find special cards one day and when they rub the card on a stone, it activates. Does this not sound like the D-readers and cards in Digimon Tamers, especially the two guys and a girl concept? And then we have the bad guys, the Alpha Gang who seem to be a rip off of Team Rocket from Pokemon. During the time that this came out, it feels like most shows were trying to mimic Pokemon and Digimon though I think this might have been the first to put both into the mix. 
The characters are pretty annoying, and seem only like spitting images of three main types of Digimon Tamers… the children. We have your standard goggle wearing (or in this case, horn visor that seems to light up for some unknown reason?) leader who is over active and doesn’t know when to stop, Max. The more level headed boy who seems to actually think, Rex. And then we have the whiny little girl, Zoe. 
Let’s start with Max… well… He’s stupid. For a guy who is really into Dinosaurs, when he first meets Chomp the Triceratops, he doesn’t seem to have any clue what it eats. If you have ever watched Land Before Time, a Triceratops is also known as a three horn and is pretty much what Sarah is. For those playing the home game, they eat plants. I guess it makes sense that the guy who wears horns on his head all the time and is probably the laughing stock wherever he goes to school because of it would be the owner of a Dinosaur with horns. Still, he treats Chomp like a dog most of the time. He also came up with ‘Dino Slash’ which feels like a rip off of ‘Go Poke ball!’ On the other hand, like all main characters, he cares deeply for the dinosaurs that keep getting abused by the Alpha Gang and wants to help them. 
Rex is pretty smart, at least as smart as a character can be in here (That isn’t much by the way…). I’m surprised that he is so grown up since his father is exactly like Doc Taylor, the father of Max. I know characters are not all the same, but if you grow up in the same type of situation, you would at least be similar to the other person. Anyway, his Dino is Ace the Carnotaurus. Ace is kind of a speedy little guy who just does not want to stay put. In fact, basically all through the first part of the series, that was all Rex was dealing with. The problem I have with this is that when they finally figure out why, it’s not Rex finding out, it’s the whinny Zoe who does. It would have been a better way to bring Rex and Ace closer together if he found out himself. 
Rex and Max also have the same complex of who is the leader that any Digimon show has. They bicker about what the right way and the wrong way of doing things is, sometimes getting themselves into more problems. There really isn’t a reason for this fighting, it just happens. The show doesn’t even make me want to root for any of them to be the leader to be fair so the whole fight just seems pointless. 
Zoe seems to be a bit thrown to the side. She has a Parasaurolophus named Paris and how she got that name feels the same as someone calling a Panda Pan or a Tiger Tig… It’s just the first few letters of the Dino’s species. She normally only uses healing cards and has a rather gentle Dino instead of a fighting dino like the other two. In shows like this, they seem to always throw the women into that area… in Pokemon, Misty was a water Pokemon expert, and only water Pokemon it seems… in Digimon, the women were always getting pushed around or not seen very much (or they are given attitudes like they are always PMS-ing like the girl in Digimon Tamers). She may be considered a main character, but she just feels like support. 
Max’s father is a little odd. Somehow, he knows a lot about the stones the kids have right away, thinking that the thoughts of the dinosaurs are trapped within them. He seems to explain the stones like he knows exactly what they are used for and what can be done with them in the second half of the first episode. I see him somewhat like a clumsy Indiana Jones in a child’s cartoon, or maybe Professor Oak. His assistant, Dr. Reese Drake, is very monotoned and never really shows much emotion even when she is angry or embarrassed. Once in a great while at the end, she does seem to lighten up but other then that, no emotion. We could just have a computer instead of her and we wouldn’t be missing much. There doesn’t even seem to be much reaction between Zoe and Dr. Drake even though they are sisters which is rather sad. I would love to see more about their relationship instead of the whole ‘hey, she is my sister and you can probably forget about that because we are never going to show any emotion like normal sisters do.’ 
Let’s talk about the villains now. Pretty much, Doctor Z would really be the father of Eggman with the outbursts and trying to take over the world lines. He wants to be king of the dinosaurs, and yet he can’t even take care of his own minions. His minion (and stepson), Ed, is so stupid, he doesn’t even know how to spell Z’s name for crying out loud! I most of the time want to call him Meoth and have him meow like him. Ursula always acts like the queen, commenting on her looks and acting as though she should be taken care off (Much like Jessie from Team Rocket). She also gets bitten a lot by dinos. Her stepbrother Zander seems to be like James in that he tries very much to make her feel good (And that isn’t in the perverted way).  
So, we can now talk about what a really stupid idea it was to make a Dinosaur Card Game for children who probably couldn’t pronounce the damn names of the Dinos! I mean, what child would know exactly how to pronounce Carnotaurus and Cryolophosaurus? I mean I can’t even pronounce them and I’m 26 (when I first reviewed this, I was 23)! Another thing that is rather strange is the fact that they brought in battle fields into the show about 9 episodes in. It is rather confusing since they were at first trying to make this show sound as though the dino’s were actually living breathing beings instead of just cards. Actually, again I am feeling like I have seen this before… in Yugioh. 
The 3D animation stuff they have in the opening is really bad. The models look very broken and dinosaurs were never meant to actually dance. They seem to flop around without any reason. It’s also the same in the actual show. Models brake pretty badly and feel as though they would be better animated then CG. The only thing they did right was showing the breathing of the dinos but that’s only a small bit for them to look ‘alive’ I guess. The textures on these modals are colorful but definitely not nice. It’s like they made the textures overly pixel-ated and choppy. The transformations make me want to yell out ‘DIGI EVOLUSION!’ because it acts pretty much the same. The 2D animation actually looks pretty good and the dinos in that form look cute too. So much that I might have wanted one as a partner too. They just really messed up by adding the 3D animation. 
Warning, it was 4kids dubbed and when people say that they messed up a lot of shows, they probably included this one in that. The voices of the main characters are really bad. Zander and Ursula sound so much like Team Rockets Jessie and James that I normally feel like I’m watching Pokémon instead. The stupid little puns they forced into the show feel like there are way too much. We can’t go five seconds without a pun it seems because everyone does them. The music is supposed to be upbeat and fun but it sounds like they were forcing it, it doesn’t fit this at all. I can’t really stand the opening song and the background music feels like it’s ripped from Sonic X.  
Overall, the whole show just seems rather pointless. If you’re a big fan of Dinosaurs, there might be something for you but I don’t see what you can get from it. The Dinos’s don’t look real at all, the coloring just feels like its overly bright and childish. I think the only thing you will get from it is the names of the dinos.

    I love this anime, I first watched this as a kid back in '10 and I fell in love. 
This anime is kind of long but the ending is very satisfying. 
I however do recommend to only watch this if you like Dinosaurs or ""creature battle"" type anime because well... this is a Dinosaur anime. 
Personally I love Dinosaurs which is why I adore this anime. I even have some DK trading cards and I am expanding my collection of DK stuff. 
Overall in my opinion: Great anime, animations are great for '08. Many different Dinosaurs and... it is just so fun to watch.

    Though not as funny as the first three OVAs, these are definitely fun and well worth watching. Ukiyo, Ryoga, and Shampoo fans will enjoy the first episode and fans of the Ranma/Akane pairing will love the tenderness in the last arc. Kasumi fans will enjoy to third arc best, but there is always something for everyone here. 
The background music and OP/ED themes were also very good (as always with Ranma 1/2) for this set.

We go about our day in different fashions. But to put it bluntly we act like children with our desires to what is needed to make it through the day. Whether it is drawing on face (makeup), improperly articulating our language in written form or spoken (using text messaging shortcuts like o.m.g. instead of saying oh my god.) We are doing it in some manner. But there are those that are not as fortunate that might as well be from the past. Struggling hard with the few amenities they have. Yet, they seem to live some what more at peace. But why might that be? This anime tends to answer that question. I could indulge you with the explanation but i will let you learn it yourself. But i will note that the message is kindhearted.

    Hmm, this is...hmm. Just finished this one, so this review will be my freshest of the seasons of Minami-ke. Prepare for disappointment.  But, before you get the wrong idea, well this IS because the studio changed again, this review is not centered on its art style alone, but it will play a major role on how this review goes. 
This season did something that I was heavily afraid of: they embraced cliché again, something that has not been done since the second season. And by embrace, I mean EMBRACE. Right off the bat, it appears that they are repeating old elements from prior seasons, recycling old ideas to be specific; and they did not do a good job with it at all. 
Before I go on, I HAVE to say the positives now. From the looks of it, all the voice actors returned yet again and the writers were still capable of writing humor that made me laugh a lot in a few areas. They finally had a moment where Fujioka almost confessed to Minami, which was all I needed. Given it is a comedy, I knew it was not gonna happen, but it was amazing to almost see. 
Lastly, the charm of the anime is still there, but now it has mixed with Okawari and Okaeri from the looks of it, as far as delivery and art style go; and just throw in things from season one, too. But, not in the way that you might think. With all that being said, though, it is still Minami-ke at the core and DID bring back the voice actors, alongside the soundtrack once more, so you might still enjoy it in that regard. 
Now, with that being said...wow, this is a handful. Um, as I said before, they DID embrace generic anime cliché again, but they took it to a new level. They brought up the infamous Ninomiya-kun show again, alongside the mysterious loincloth people showing up at festivals, and they were trying to recycle a lot of old running gags from the first season. 
This would be fine, but they delivered them quite badly. On top of that, they had actual cringe-worthy moments quite a bit, but made up for it by returning one of my favorite elements of Okaeri: the background talk. In some scenes, two sets of characters will be talking to each other and whenever the main conversation is not humoring enough, the other one usually is and it is quite enjoyable to watch their reactions throughout it all. The background alone is almost more enticing than what they WANT you to pay attention to. 
Oh, and the worst of it? Hosaka. Now, they just decided that he would be a mental case instead of having him confess to Haruka, though they brought up the whole reason why he was doing this to begin with: the volleyball club! ANOTHER season one reference, and one that I actually forgot myself, but he actually WASN'T in love with her! I completely forgot about that, so that was a surprising reminder. 
Right, the mental case part you're curious about. Well, apparently, he didn't talk to her for so long that he fell in love with himself. To elaborate, the ""Haruka within himself"" of whom he saw in his thoughts. Apparently, nobody could find out why Haruka was ""imperfect"" and so Hosaka just believed her to be a goddess. The problem? He worshiped her like a fictional goddess; one that he would never actually meet because he never talked to her. 
But, the one thing that irks me is that he was actually about to and Hayami STOPPED him, ate his offering to her and basically turned him insane; making her my least favorite character of the entire anime after that. She basically took away his only chance of talking to her, and he was pretty casual about it, too. He had a lunch ready and was actually steps away from her, but thanks to Hayami, he never saw her for the remainder of the season and, well, as I said before, went insane basically. Also, he still sees her sisters as her daughters. 
Okay, let's see, what else. They introduced a new character, but she is purely filler at most; named Miyuki, she has a lifeless personality and was meant to be somewhat of a mix between Keiko and Kana at first, though she later went from recurring to minor quite rapidly as she only had one major appearance in a segment and, well, she was not as interesting as their newest addition, Riko, whom still brought up one of the more humorous love triangles I have ever seen. 
So, the question. Can I recommend this one? That, I can actually say ONLY if you're a die-hard fan of the anime series, because well it did retain most of the charm, it was not that enjoyable to me and I did not prioritize it as much as I did with Minami-ke (my default label for the first season) and Okaeri. Heck, Okawari would be better than this, personally because it had less cliché in it in comparison and was actually more enjoyable in a few areas. 
I won't be too harsh and say this season was pure trash, but it didn't appeal to me too much. The only major thing it did was give the anime the most detailed backgrounds I had ever seen, but they still didn't breath the same color into them as the first did. Regardless, they were still very well drawn and detailed. 
My score is about as honest as I can get here. And, normally, whenever I dislike an anime, I don't even put too much life into myself to write the review for it; hence, this one coming off as a bit cluttered and not as high on vocabulary as the first review was. But, I do have a few anime that I literally hate to death, so this one is not that bad. If you're a fan of Minami-ke, go for it.  
But, if you enjoyed seasons one and three, I might want to skip this one; keyword: might. If you enjoyed season two, you perhaps will like this one a lot as it brings more of that one's style here again with the cliché elements and all, but it is really up to your own personal preference on which seasons you enjoyed the most.

    I like how Minami-ke Tadaima begins each episode with a brief commentary: 
""This story is a simple illustration of the three Minami sisters and the ordinary life they lead. Please don't expect too much from it."" - Minami Chiaki. 
Just like all the previous seasons, fans of Minami-ke should be familiar with how it begins an episode with one of the characters commenting along those lines and that's essentially what Minami-ke is entirely about;heartwarming slice-of-life revolving around three plain girls with very lighthearted jokes delivered throughout the entire show. Alas, this season is one you shouldn't ""expect too much from it"", just as Chiaki said. 
With no story or focus on whatsoever, Minami-ke Tadaima is the latest follow-up, fourth season in the Minami-ke series, however, it does not require the viewer to have watch the prequels in order to understand the storyline(because there really isn't any) or know the characters(because they already provided introductions for most characters). Comedy presented in Tadaima is very light, so don't expect yourself to burst out in laughter. Apart from a few chuckles, Tadaima's sense of humor is random sadly, its bland and unimaginative. Even so, Tadaima is relaxing to watch. 
Like all seasons of Minami-ke, Tadaima also had undergone a refresh regarding its artstyle. Okaeri, Okawari and the first all had different artstyle. This season's new art is good, however, its none too special or memorable. Just one's personal opinion though, I still find Minami-Ke's first season was far superior compared to any of the other seasons, in terms of humor, OP and ED and rewatchability, just the artstyle looked pretty dated. 
Characters are pretty much unchanged; Kana remains to be the naive, energetic middle sister. Chiaki being the youngest but has more brains than Kana does, and Haruka being the motherly-type. There's almost no character development throughout the seasons so far. On that final note, most of them are still adorable as ever and to be more specific, there wasn't a character I disliked. Hosaka remains to be the most eccentric and funniest character in the whole series.  
Ultimately, Minami-ke Tadaima was an decent show for me. On the plus side, the charming characters remained intact, has solid visuals and also can be relaxing to watch but regrettably its sense of humor has gone stale. Some people may even consider this to be the weakest season. Nonetheless, Minami-ke Tadaima should appeal to slice of life junkies, but for anyone looking for good laughs, stay away.

    Has this series changed or have i? 
I'm just not sure anymore. The first Minami-ke series sits comfortably in my all time best shows, to me this was the defining slice of life comedy to which i compare all others. 
Okawari's change in studio annoyed me, the visuals were unfamiliar, this shows pacing gives you a great deal of time for such grievances to fester, but the content was still enjoyable.  
I watched an episode of Okaeri and left it at that, the problem has gone beyond a minor annoyance. 
With Tadaima the studio was again changed again, and they've done a decent job with the visuals, so why am i not loving the show again? 
The characters are the same, the style is more or less the same, the art is good. I'm wondering if the shows simply played on the same running jokes a little bit to long, it's all starting to seem a little to familiar. Kana and Chiaki don't seem to have quite as hilarious a chemistry playing off each other. 
The expanded cast do not do the show allot of favor's, we get allot of sketches, only partially involving a Minami sister, or sometimes not at all, i usually greet these with a sigh, they're not all that engaging, the Makoto gags seem to have been done to death, they just generally seem to be animating the same material over and over.  
The bulk of the pittance of a MAL following this show has, must be existing fans, so is it just me? Or has the show run its course for premium content.

    This is the 4th Season of Minami-ke and I'm glad to report that a lot of effort seems to be put into this one, probably making it the best of the series, so it is definitely a MUST WATCH. 
Just like the rest of the series, it is still a situational slice of life comedy so not much development is to be expected, which is reminded in each episode. The art is great and probably even greater than the rest of the series. It features the same VAs which fit each character, good OP and ED, and BGMs that fit each scene. They have the same fun characters and the supporting ones were given increased screen times, giving viewers a chance to get to know more about the cast and their roles, and showing a better, wider view of the world of the Minami's. 
Minami-ke Tadaima is most enjoyable. Each episode contains several sketches which were carefully planned for quality humor, and is incorporated with fanservice of just the right amount and level that is strategically used for some gags. Few minute problems exist such as the use of backgrounds that do not match the mood/situation and some overly forced coincidences, but these do not at all affect the overall Minami-goodness, and viewers would still be served with good laughs.

    Minami ke- A show I had never known about before this season but I just plunged through all the seasons and watched. Why? It was amazing. 
Tis is mostly geared to people who havent watched minami ke series yet cuz if you hve, you dont need a review to watch it 
Rating Overall- 9.4 
Ok. The minami ke series deserves a 10 in my book. Except that I wish it were longer so I can laugh for so 9. 
Story-9 
Every episode is comedy and absolute joy. For example, I broke my thumb and got water in my eye. I was feeling awful and minami ke just cheered me up. Got to say, this is like awesome medicine:P for sadness to joy. 
Characters- 10 
Every charaters is unique, likable and help you enjoy and laugh with their trooubles. THe thre protagonists, the sisters, each represent a different sector of people ranging for responsible, intelligent, and clueless(KANA COUGH). Even the least likable of charactrs (KANA) prove themselves with kind deeds and help you relate and at least bear with them  
Sound/art-10 
Brilliant art and sound. The music is great and I listen to op, end everytime. Animation is fluid and amazing too. IT really brings out the comedy 
Enjoyment- 10 
THis can bring me to laughter in seconds, just looking at the characters interact brings me joy. rewatching is also great cuz everything is just so amazing  
Overall-9 
It totally deserves a 10, but it is just so good that because I know it will end is bringing me sadness. 
Honestly, you should watch this season if you watched the previous, or if not, watch the first season to be introduced to the characters and watch the rest of the seasons (doesnt have to be in order)  
Funny story, so I watched the first season then skipped to Okaeri(season 3 meaning Im back) instead of Okawari(season 2 meaning seconds) but it still fit and was amazing. Basically, watch the minami ke series, it rivals  Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai and kore wa zombie desu ka in terms of comedy 
I personally almost didnt watch this because of the description (three girls and their daily lives) cuz honestly, it sounds pretty lame. However, this is like the greatest of comedies, with a dash of romance and others to make it even funnier. Especially the suitors after the protagonist, now they are epic (FUJIOKA KUN!!!) 
REMINDER: WATCH FIRST SEASON IF YOU HAVENT< OTHERWISE WATCH THIS ... ITS EPIC (NO kidding)  
Thanks for reading, I hope I encouraged you to watch this. Its great for like all audiences cuz seriously, who doesnt need comedy?

    Minami-Ke Tadaima is the fourth season of the series Minami-Ke. It’s a slice of life comedy with elements of high school romance sprinkled into the mix. To say that this show is unique and is a “must watch” would be stretching it. The slice of life genre has always been one of my favorites, but this show just didn't do it for me. The jokes are pretty stale and some of them lose their potential humor simply because of the way they’re set up. But let’s stop with the general impressions and get into the specifics, shall we? 
Being a slice of life school comedy, Minami-Ke Tadaima respectively does not have a complicated plot. It follows the ordinary lives of three sisters: Kana, Chiaki, and Haruka Minami. Each episode is formatted linearly: An ordinary problem is presented, hijinx ensues, and a conclusion is met. It’s simple and should be effective. I say “should” because the sheer quality of most of the jokes and the reactions of the characters actually works against this linear format. That's not to say that the show never made me laugh. It got me a few times, but for a comedy, it was rare. 
Aside from Hosaka and Kana--huge shout-outs to their voice actors by the way--most of the cast is a bit uninteresting. Again, most of the show's failings are brought up from the lack of reactions and lack of exaggerated responses from the characters and some of the characters ended up as tropes. Take Makoto's character for instance. In order to hang out with Kana without drawing the suspicion of his classmates, Makoto takes on the form of Mako--a female version of himself. You would think that this could draw out a few laughs, but the setup for the jokes are really typical and not fun in all honesty. In truth, I think the whole show could be described as “really typical and not fun,” but I do think the music helps ease the boredom. 
The music from the show is actually pretty good. The music used in the comedic scenes generated a silly, albeit cheesy, atmosphere. More specifically, the opening was always something I looked forward to listening to. It was really upbeat and I think it captured what the show really tried to be: a heavily emphasized comedy. The ending theme was less than addicting, but my ears didn't bleed because of it, so that's good. 
Art Style / Animation: 
Being a show from 2013, Minami-Ke Tadaima actually doesn't look great in comparison to some of the other shows that came out at the time. While the art style is a bit dated, the animation is serviceable enough and the character designs are unique and even a bit fun at times. While I wouldn’t consider the artistic direction of the show to be its strong suit, I can see how others might enjoy it for its simplicity. 
Overall Impressions: 
Minami-Ke Tadaima was a pretty below average experience for me. It just wasn't as much fun as I thought it'd be and I really like the slice of life genre, so I know that's not the problem. Aside from Hosaka's and Kana’s characters, the show was a bore to get through. With its lack of good characters, its repeated use of unfunny jokes, and without a solid reason to keep me coming back to the show, I had a really hard time getting through this one. Even some fans of the show found out that they didn’t love this season of Minami-Ke in particular. In the words of Chiaki herself, “Please do not expect much out of it.” I cannot and will not recommend this show, even to slice of life fans.

Introduction was nice, a tad confusing but nice. It was confusing to me for i am almost always thinking why? Why am i seeing this? What connection is there to this anime? What is to come. But that isn't what this plot's introduction was about. It was about escape and rest. Knowing that now i can't help but reflect upon how much i appreciated that brief moment. Even if was completely plot-less. 
Overall story was simple. Given the nature of the crime i am glad it was kept at a somewhat pg-13 level. I say somewhat for word choices could greatly be improved but mainly there was no rape component when there it could have been. Those kind of story are almost always emotional and pains me to see those of innocent in any form of pain. 
Was the ending justified? i will let you be the judge. If i present you with a case for example of peanut butter and jelly being the most popular sand-which making. Would you simply be happy with knowing the answer and not knowing more about it? Like why i felt that to be a popular choice? Or why i didn't choose ham and cheese sand-which or so instead? Or why one should care why we are having this debate in the first place? These questions or aftermath thoughts are what haunts me. Which is why i can't be happy when an anime ends just after a verdict is made.  
I thought the movie to be good. A small action movie with some mild form of comedy kept my spirits up and my interests vested. It didn't seem to bore me by making me pray for an ending. I was especially happy when it came to the credits. Not only did the artists/director remind you how this artwork was painfully hand drawn but there was a slight reward for those like me that love aftermath plot.

    Story: Mostly conforms to your typical, over the top 80s police thriller flick. Buddy cops going rogue to take on the bad dudes with some serious artillery. However, while most 80s villains deal with drugs, these ones happen to traffic female slaves. A serious and rather dark issue for an other wise extremely light hearted OVA. Indeed, this story aspect and all its implications is never seriously touched upon by the OVA. There is overall nothing wrong with the very standard plot apart from the ending which seems rushed and abrupt. 
Also keep an lookout for 80s pop culture references that do not add anything to the OVA, apart from make it more blatantly a 80s product than it already is. 
Art: The animation and art is standard of late 80s, early 90s anime OVAs. A lot of the more intense and usually; vehicular based action scenes are of a higher quality or are at least, more ambitious; ie the shifting multi angle continuous shot during the opening chase scene. Also typically 80s is the mecha design a.k.a. fcking awesome. The mech design seems to take cues from (and indeed pretty much every other aspect) from good old Bubblegum Crisis and indeed, AIC would go on to do BGC 2040. 
Sound: Once again, the music is your stereotypical 80s glam/hard rock. While mostly only people who lived during the 80s can appreciate that overused drivel, it is still far superior to the could be alternatives for a mindless action anime. It fits and does its job.  
The sound effects are average. They do the job of bringing the cars and various automatics to life. 
I wouldn't be able to say much about the Japanese voices but the English dubs are actually above average for an early 90s OVA. 
Character: The main girls remind me of laid back versions of BGCs main heroines (minus Sylia) in their personalities. The reckless yet loyal action girl characters of 80s anime never gets old and their spunk is always more than enough to single handedly drive an anime and Maki is no exception. Reimi is your typical supporting sidekick character while Yuka (reminding me ALOT of Nene) is the cute character and comic relief though all three characters have comedic moments. Not to also mention, that black cop who's only purpose seems to be spooking our three protagonists. 
The main villain isn't particularly memorable or formidable but he scores extra evil points for the aforementioned human trafficking. 
Enjoyment: Like most 80s action flicks, don't take this one seriously and try to enjoy the anime girls shooting the crap out of everything trope that the 80s did so well. Unlike most 80s action flicks however, it seems a shade less in violence and explosion count. Less people and things seem to be blown away than many other 80s action OVAs of same length. This can be probably blamed on the 'climactic' firefight which is nowhere near as high octane or spectacular as the opening chase sequence. 
Female main characters always means fanservice. Skin is bared but surprisingly, I don't think any boobs slip. However, there is still a fetish fuel torture sequence and of course, human slavery isn't the prettiest topic either. One last thing to mention; while its not great, Burn Up! somehow got popular enough to turn into a franchise!?

    There is NO excuse in my eyes to write about the sequels, but not the very 1st ova-movie of the franchise?? Damn right it is! One of the reasons I like old school anime is because stuff like this still had entertainment when the credits roll, in a small corner you saw production sketches, extra deleted scenes, further development of the series and unfinished drawings with nice popmusic to listen to, I miss that. This is the 1st installment of the Burn Up serie's started in 1991, so that means EVERYTHING was handdrawn, probably not everyone's taste these days since some animation, especially the girls here are looking a bit 'stereotypical' but you can look past that. As for the plot it's a not too complex police story for the time, quite easy to follow. Art is typical although I like 1 particular scene then a police car drives on a interstate and the camera zooms out while its driving from above..... well done, Rockmusic tracks together with badass police chicks was always a fav thing to me. And as I said before about the 'stereotypical girl look' , it soon chances as things got more serious and action-packed, leaving the innocent look behind making the chara more likable. Enjoyment is mainly on the comedy/ecchi side I would say if you are a big fan of those genres.

        To make it clear, Servant x Service series basically is slice-of-life genre, like other slice-of-life themes, its also contains comedy genre. It's quite hard to imagine how the story goes on Servant x Service ward office when what you have watched only around school life mixing with slice-of-life genres. There's no school as background in the series, sometimes the characters also going out to a restaurant, shopping district and even other characters places. The background itself isn't the boring place to begin with because it's so freaking funny. No doubt the series will cheer your day even if you're not in the good mood to start with.  
    The characters are what makes the whole series so lively even if it takes place in the ward office. Find the innocent main heroine is arguing with her hard-work co-worker~in the other side, her co-worker is a costume maker and cosplayer too. The lovey-dovey scenes also filled with comedy contents, damn heart-warming! You can find how easily the characters and storyline distract yourself. It's not a harem genre, so the characters of male and female almost even. The simple yet appealing art will please your eyes along with the jokes. 
    For the soundtrack themes, subjectively I like both of em. Not liking it 'til I play it all day and everyday, but it's good to hear. The beating for opening and a bit mellow for the ending theme. For me, I wish they will make a sequel for Servant x Service, I miss all of the characters (ಥಿ∀ಥ ；) 
And talk about the rate, it's pleasure to me to give it 9. Yeah, really. tehee! 
Lovable characters, unique setting, jokes 
Nice visual, the colouring is soft yet straight 
Romantic x comedy series? Choose this! 
Some ecchi-ness (related to jokes) (*I put it into cons because there's ecchi when it will be freaking good even without any ecchi)

    At a glance, this seems like your typical no-story slice of life comedy.  While this is mostly true, this series boasts an exceptional trait that you won't see anywhere else in the genre : 
No high school. 
It can't be overstated how important this is.  This alone makes the series very refreshing.  But on top of that, it is generally very low on your typical tropes.  You sometimes forget you're watching anime.   
Since the show is mostly plot-less, a good humor level is required to keep the viewer entertained.  It usually delivers.   The not-so-funny parts normally feel comfy and relaxing, rather than boring.   
Characters in SxS aren't too archetypal and are generally lovable.  There is no fan services, but the girls are cute and consistently well-drawn, so no issues there.  
Normally i don't care much for audio, but here there is no doubt that it adds clear value to the experience.  The goofy songs, the hilarious bunny squeaking sounds increase the humor value considerably.  Not to mention SxS boasts probably the greatest opening song i have ever heard.  I'll end you if you skip it.   
I can't give it more than 7 because it is, well, plot-less.   It serves as good casual entertainment, but it won't surprise, it won't amaze, it won't trigger emotional responses, it won't be memorable.  There is also an over-abundance of ""internal tsukkomis"" which we could really do without.   
If you enjoyed minami-ke, non non biyori, strawberry marshmallow, give this a listen; it's basically the same concept but with adult characters.

    I could easily say for sure that this is really one of the best Slice-Of-Life out there. Most people might have clearly forgotten about the true means of ""Slice-of-Life"" or most basically about the elements of life. 
Anyway, I love the Opening and Ending, I also love the characters. 
The interaction between workers and clients are also really fun. 
The mini love story and development inside the Service center is also ideal. 
I'd give it 9/10 without a doubt. 
MAL tells me to write something longer tho.. 
Well, there are a lot of Slice-of-Life anime out there, but I could say that at least, this one really got me watching even though exams are currently on the way. I'd say that it was nicely developed with consideration of the characters in the story.

    I picked up Servant x Service after watching and really enjoying Working!! which was by the same studio.  I found Working!! to be charming and really entertaining as a slice of life show about a rather ordinary type of routine and I saw that they had made a show that was related to office work, and figured that I would really enjoy it quite a bit as well. 
I was disappointed that wasn't the case. 
Servant x Service is a slice of life comedy show with a little bit of absurdity similar to Working!!  The biggest problem is that the characters in Servant x Service seem to miss the mark and fall flat quite a bit of the time compared to the far more interesting and entertaining cast from Working!! and frankly, other shows as well. 
There isn't much that this show has going for it that makes it stand out.  Most of the technical aspects are average.  There aren't many risks or interesting lines of character development.  It feels like it goes through the motions of a manga or light novel adaptation, serving as an advertisement to try to drum up some interest in the source material.   
It's not that a show about working in a government office has to be rather uninteresting.  Given decent writing and some more interesting characters and this may have worked.  The television show The Office was quite funny and even relateable to anyone who has worked in a cubicle, even if it was a bit exaggerated at points.  However, the characters in Servant x Service aren't really that deep and their development never really went in any kind of interesting or unpredictable direction.  The main twist at the end was easy to see coming a mile away and was pretty cliched.   
It's sort of easy to fall into a trap with shows like this where you end up pushed along watching episodes through sheer inertia to get through the series to see if it's going to be interesting after you've seen how they're going to play things out, only to be disappointed that they take the safe road and keep the characters as punchlines and archetypes instead of developing them.  Just as things start taking an interesting direction, the show ends and you're left trying to figure out if it's worth getting into the source material.  In this case, most likely not.   
While Servant x Service isn't a bad show, even if this review comes off rather negative, there are better shows in the genre to spend your time on.  I would watch Working!! from the same studio instead as it does just about everything this show does with better characters, actual character development, and story lines that are interesting. 
Bottom line is that this is a very average show, and isn't as memorable as other better entries in the genre.  I'd only recommend it if you really like slice of life shows and want something in an office environment.

    Well, I saw this anime for only one reason: Same author as Working!!, one of my top comedy animes, and let me say, I really liked it. 
I´ll go over some things that I really enjoyed about this anime, without spoilering too much, so here I go: 
1) To begin with let´s talk about the opening. Visuals were great, the song was spot-on with the visuals and the spoilers where minimun, that is not found on every opening, for example OP 12 of Bleach, with good song and visuals, but with all the spoilers you can get under 1:30. This three points make a great OP what it is: great, like for example Noragami or Tokyo Ghoul, anime wich I have not seen yet but almost did because of the Opening. 
2) The characters in general. At the begining, after reading the summary, I was thinking the characters would be a lot more exagerated, and I was glad to see not so crazy characters that had actual development on the series. Something worth noticing about the characters is that they had a pretty balanced screen time, just like Working, wich is a big plus on my eyes 
3) The relationships. Maybe this will be a little spoilery, so feel free to skip it. On the first couple of episodes I was foreseeing that Lucy would fall for Hasabe, but I was pleased to see that it was the other way around, and it actually made him develop as a character quite a bit. On the other hand, the ship between Chihaya and Ichimiya was quite wierd for me at the begining. I though ""Well, if he´s got a Tsundere imouto, why whould he need a Kuudere girlfriend?"". Little by little it grew on me, but it was still kinda wierd. 
4) The plot, if you can call it that way. It was what I was specting, taking into acount that it´s similar to Working!!, so it was not a let down at all. I found it spot on. 
I can only find a couple of things I disliked/didn´t liked that much about the anime overall. First the character of Tanaka. It´s not that I hated him or something, because his character was made hate-able on pourpose, but he was to similar to Yamada Kirio from... well, Working. The thing I didn´t like was that the bothering character was basically the same but grown up. The other thing I disliked was that the art reminded me was a little far from what I expected it to be, but it was good overall, so it´s more like a neutral thing. 
TL;DR: This is an anime worth watching if you´re looking for a little bit of japanesse humour (not like ususal moedies) and you already saw Working!!. I´ll be waiting for a S2 :D

    I love SoL animes, but this one... This one is something that you can't just miss. Talking about something so not amazing is what makes it so amazing, so unique... A friend's recommendation on ""Working!!"", from the same author, made me excited for it! 
{STORY - 10/10} 
An anime about work may seem boring at first, but SxS really changes that concept and proves us the opposite. Focusing on an uncommon theme, it shows a bit of civil servants' routine at office, with some comedy and even romantic situations. 
Three novices at the ""Health and Welfare"" section are introduced. First episodes aren't promising at all, but it begins showing its huge potential after some time and everyone's personal life takes place on some particular episodes. Mostly authentical. 
{ART - 8/10} 
Overall art hasn't amazed me, it's quite simple on every aspect. Maybe that was supposed to match the mature enviroment and the adult characters... Suitable. But what called my attention was the opening. That has to be the most creative sequence I've ever saw! All the movement, the nice ""real x anime"" combination and a lot of references to a ""busy day at work"" deserves to be praised! 
{SOUND - 9/10} 
""May I Help You?"", performed by the three main female characters' voice actresses, introduces each episode with very quick rhythmics and lyrics about SxS' focus: the daily routine of an office employee. ""Hachimitsu Tokidoki"", used on credits, represents the end of a business day, as it describes some usual moments of relaxation, like a bath, being performed only by Ai Kayano. 
{CHARACTER - 8/10} 
SxS features few, but each one has its own working manner, representing common types of employees. Lucy, slow and distracted, is the main piece, as the plot turns around her. Miyoshi is that kind that undeniably hears what citizens have to say, eventhough she doesn't like it... Chihaya, quiet but menacing, it the most serious amoung everone, ignoring the fact that she loves cosplaying and making costumes. 
As for male characters, we have Ichimiya, who is an unxeperient senior, incapable of being sensible. His role is to guide all novices during their activities. Hasebe, unconcerned, makes a huge presence after some episodes. He always tries to run away from his duties and have a calm and sweet aura, due to his relaxed personality. 
{ENJOYMENT - 8/10} 
It's different, pretty original. Involving a theme like that is daring. Still, adding comedy and romance improved SxS' experience, making it way more pleasurable. It tries to makes us understand that having a job isn't exactly based upon a dull, boring routine... 
{OVERALL - 9/10} 
Working, with a small touch of fun. That's how it should be, right? SxS is a way to show that being an adult who has an office job can still be happy with that and live with a smile on his face. There are awkward, embarrassing and even insane moments, as it takes the ""work"" definition to the next level!

    From the creator of the wonderful Working!! series (a series I adore as well) comes yet another well done adult working life anime named Servant x Service. Much like it's other sibling, Servant x Service marks itself as an underrated (popularity sense) piece of art 
First off, you don't see many adult life stories in anime in general, so Servant x Service is one of a kind in many senses as well. Even from a romance fan's perspective, I felt it moved from Slice of Life to Romance a little to hastily in the second half of the anime, although the last two episodes were brilliant, I still felt that it should have been more Slice of Life focused, but then again this means that a proper plot can't be established. Nevertheless Servant x Service did well in it's tricky situation and came out on top in the end. 
Art: 8/10 
The art was nicely done. It has that rare appeal I love that it made every character cute in their own way. Character design was a little but repetitive in my opinion as there wasn't much difference in a few of the characters (a downfall of the aforementioned feature). Other than that it was decent. Another thing I liked was the background design. It really made it look like the cast was in a busy office, and though I don't usually pay attention o backgrounds even I noticed them this time. 
Sound: 8/10 
Once again, much like my previous anime Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, I preferred the ending more than the opening, although both are in my opinion. The Opening clearly showed the anime's message but I liked the lyrics and the best of the ending much more than the OP. The BGM was surprisingly funny as well, now this is something I notice very rarely in anime that the music is funny in a dominant way rather as an assisting point to the plot humor. The synth was hilariously done and at times I laughed at it instead of the humor in the anime (which was also good btw).  
I would've rated it higher if it wasn't too focused on Hasebe and Lucy in the latter half of the anime. Like I said, the first half was excellent since all characters got a chance to shine, Lucy, Hasebe, Megumi, everyone. But sadly it suddenly turned into a romance and focused on the mentioned characters more. This was a problem since the others didn't get as much screentime but the benefit was that Lucy and Hasebe developed very well, another thing I liked in Working!! which if you forgot was written by the same author. The whole cast was very unique. They had their own unique tasted and I'm happy to see that they were quite relatable to real life as well (although not to that extent obviously, this IS an anime you know) like how workers dealt with stress, how they dealt with personal life, how civil servants really feel when they work, all that. Ironically, this had more working segments and plot focus than Working!!. Which is quite ironic and funny too.  
Enjoyment: 9/10 
Much like Working!!, it was a blast watching Servant x Service. It was funny, showed the adult work life in a hilarious manner and even showed us how office romances go about. I've already been watching many Slice of Life anime in a row and this was just as fun as the others were (namely Tanaka-kun and Gekkan Shoujo), which could be an indirect praise as it shows that to me they were all at equal footing, including the unfortunately less popular Servant x Service (really, it deserves more popularity). 
Overall: 8.2 (Averaged) 
A little above an 8, Servant x Service shows us the work life of adults, how they dealt with their daily lives at work, and a whole lot in between. It was a lot of fun watching this and it's comedy was also very good. All these show that overall, Servant x Service is a must watch anime to all Slice of Life lovers, especially you're a fan of working segments and the anime Working!! itself. The author once again proves he is one if the best at adult life working anime! 
P.S: Why is it that all the Megumis in all the animes are the best characters? Ja na, Megumi best girl here as well <3 And also, don't forget Saya-chan! She is one of the funniest characters in the anime and severly underrated, Saya 2nd best girl as well <3

    Story: so i mean this kinda has or maybe does have a story its basically that the 5 main characters of the anime work as civil servants at a business and i mean that's really it honestly well maybe that one of the main character's is there because she got a weird name as a kid that someone actually gave the go for the name so Lucy is pretty much working there so she can find out who gave the go for the name otherwise this is purely a comedy workplace anime. 
Art: the art is really good here bad about i actually kinda or actually really liked the Op and Ed art at the start and end of it they dud a good job with that. 
Sound: ok so the Op and the Ed are pretty good (but honestly nothing id download though) there good but i wouldn't say that good as of the Voices for the characters they were actually really good nothing wrong with them at all. 
Character: Lucy is one of the main characters of the anime and well to describe her can get flustered pretty easy and is somewhat clueless to some stuff but she does have a good and nice personality otherwise a pretty good and fun character. Yutaka is another main in the anime well to describe him he is pretty much good at anything like the smart one (if that makes any sense) like he can do ventriloquism and sign language so he can pretty much do every thing and he has a happy go lucky attitude so he's pretty up and going again another good character. Taishi is another main character and to describe him he is pretty he's kinda happy go lucky but can also get flustered with the new ones (who are 3 of the main characters) coming in and how to direct them he can also get at you when he needs to id say he's decent at best though. Megumi is another main lead and well to describe her she doesn't really show really emotion at all unless someone talks about cosplay or anime in general she can also get at you when see needs to as well but in a more rude kind of way id say she's a alright character i didn't mind her. Saya is the last main lead of the anime and to describe her i mean she is shy and also passive she is really shy to start the anime but does kinda come out more later on (but not really) also being passive she sometimes doesn't really speak up for her self as well but id say like another person here she is a character that i didn't mind. 
Enjoyment: What i liked: the comedy in this is really well done here and the characters really bring out that comedy as well the comedy and the characters didn't disappoint here and the Voices for the anime did really well here as well and the art wasn't that bad either here. What i didn't like: i guess if there was something i didn't care for about this anime it would be the Op and Ed weren't the greatest and like the 3 characters i said were meh were decent but not to the point where i liked them or loved them. 
Overall: id give this a 8 the comedy was actually really good here (didn't get a 9 out of me cause even though it really funny it wasn't like laugh out funny the whole way through) also the fact that i didn't mind all the characters and the Op and the Ed and also the art wasn't half bad either gave me this rating please check this out it was worth the watch.

    I can only imagine there being so much hilariousness occurring in an office for public services. Yes, Yamagami’s breast size is definitely noticed, but it’s not the driving point of the series, to my relief. The characters made every work day exciting by just being themselves. I found myself having to hold back my laughter while I was watching in my room late at night. Who knew adults could have so much fun at work? 
Despite my skepticism at first, I liked how the anime started out. The viewer rides on the coattails of the three newbies who arrive for their first day working as civil servants. For people who haven’t been to the public office often, they can see the characters go about their work here. Civil servants direct others to windows where workers have information on registration forms for marriage, baby names, and other social services. There also seems to be a window where a worker listens to someone’s problems. Even if all the silliness in this show were real, I wouldn’t mind working here for the stability and neatness. 
It doesn’t get more specific on that, though. Obviously there’s a lot of paperwork involved. Organization is key for these public services. What are they filling in? What are they arranging? Eh, that’s not so important anyway. All there is to know is that most of the main characters are fairly competent in their work despite being newcomers; the main problems that come along are the interpersonal relationships between coworkers and problematic people that arrive for help. 
It’s not just the side characters that are a little wacky, though. The main ones have their own quirks. 
For example, the black-haired top-heavy glasses-wearing woman Yamagami-san is a dependable worker, but took a job as a civil servant for one of the weirdest reasons: she wants to find the man responsible for approving her insanely long name on her birth certificate. Never mind that her parents were the ones indecisive enough to give her so many names. The man who approved the form probably didn’t even check it properly enough! 
Hasebe is a tall and lanky brown-haired goofball who manages to do his work extremely well and slack off at the same time. Though this type of character can’t possibly exist in reality, it’s quite comical to see one being so multi-talented and yet also lazy. Additionally he has a habit of getting girls’ email addresses just to collect them, but setting that aside, I was continually amazed by his abilities in the office. 
Last but not least, there’s a nervous college graduate named Miyoshi who wants to do the best she can at her first job. She’s a sweetheart and puts up with more than she needs to because she’s kind, but she will stand up for herself and others if need be. Her character didn’t shine as much as the others, but I still like the kind of person she is. 
As you can see, this cast of characters in Servant x Service really makes the show. Yamagami’s dumb innocence and denseness is typical of characters in other anime but was really cute to see in an adult. She’s also a very hard worker, so I admire that. Hasebe’s carefree personality and jovial attitude really contrasts with the rest of the office, so he’s good comedic relief and it’s funny to see him bother others. It’s also humorous to see Miyoshi in sticky situations where she’s helpless and can only stay at her post because that’s her job. There’s no end to all the work in public office. 
Aside from the everyday hassles of being a civil servant, the protagonists have to deal with their own little issues which almost always leak into their work atmosphere. There was the awkwardness of keeping a secret, Yamagami’s perpetual insecurity about her long name, another coworker’s obsession with cosplaying, and much more. The situations that occur in Servant x Service are not highly unrealistic, but certainly ridiculous at times. There was only one part that I had an issue with, but otherwise every scenario made me giggle. 
What’s curious about the artwork is that all the characters look pretty young despite being adults. However, since everyone has a youngish face, it’s consistent in their world and is adorable. There was nothing too fancy about the way people were drawn, though; it was quite simple but not too much. 
I didn’t find the animation to be any different from typical slice of life anime as well. There were jarring cuts to shocked faces which emphasized surprise very well. Frequently expressions of glee and happiness were accompanied by little flowers and mini suns that obviously set the mood. A show like Servant x Service didn’t need any overly complicated animations. 
Ah, and the soundtrack. To be honest, I found it quite average. They used the right kind of music at each time, like easy-listening tracks at during their quiet times in the office, absurdly silly tracks during ridiculous moments, and so on. 
The OP really spoke for itself, though. I was a little perturbed at how jolly it was, but it does well to indicate that the following anime is a comedy. It’s spunky, poppy, and could be annoying if you’re not into high-pitched girls singing along to the accompaniment of a peppy piano. 
I’m quite disappointed that this anime doesn’t have a second season. The ending is indeed a good one, but the story could be expanded in order to talk more about a certain shipping. However, I laughed a whole lot and watched this series in two-episode bursts. Office humor is appealing to me, especially since I’m the age in which I should be working. Office romance is definitely enjoyable as well. Without a doubt, I’m going to pick up the manga and see how the rest of the story goes.

    Servant x Service is another example of great characters creating great comedy using the most oddest setting I've seen yet, the health and welfare division of a government ward office in Hokkaido. With such an odd premise, I was extremely skeptical if they were gonna be able to execute a slice of life anime in an office setting and still be entertaining, especially after the influx of school-club-slice-of-life K-on copycats the last couple of years that couldn't deliver. However, Servant x Service was able to execute the comedy with flying colors, using mainly the awesome characters but also hilarious plot to create overall enjoyment that was consistent throughout the series, no matter which character they followed, where they followed them to, or what happened.  
The story was quite enjoyable and I really loved how they tied everything together from beginning to end. The comedy was always consistent, and I'd laugh pretty loud at some of the antics of this creative cast of characters, no matter where they went, who they followed, or what happened. The story mainly focuses on Lucy but the anime developed all the characters quite well and maintained the comedy no matter which character they focused on using a fly-on-the-wall approach to the narration that actually worked quite well. 
The art didn't seem to be anything special but was definitely well executed and the sound was pretty good. The opening and endings were probably the most interesting aspect to the art, using some live-action clips and clearly real-life photos with added cg and anime art. The music was really fun and light and I loved the opening, ending, and background music throughout the entire episodes. For some of the transitions and background they used what I think sounds like a recorder and bells, an excellent choice for establishing a very light and non-serious mood to the series. I also found the opening song to be really clear at conveying the craziness of a busy workplace as well as the comical theme of the series.  
Besides the opening and ending art, I really liked the background colors used in the scenes as well as the character colors because it went with the light humorous mood that was present throughout the series. You couldn't really take any of the characters seriously except for maybe Miyoshi and Ichimiya due to their less eccentric personalities compared to the rest of the characters. The rest of them all had their strange quirks like the cowlick, squinty eyes, or wardrobe that set them apart. 
Besides the music the voice actors were simply outstanding and are probably the main success of the comedy in this series. The characterizations for Hasabe, Lucy, Miyoshi- all of the voices in general were just perfect. They all had their own style and quirks that matched their personality. Without such amazing voice acting their personalities wouldn't have come through as well and the comedy would've suffered. I found all the characters cute and it's really hard not to fall in love with their special quirks. Hasabe had his constant slacking and talked with such an amazing monotonenasal-sounding voice that just clashed superbly with his smile with closed eyes. Lucy- you just gotta love her innocence, clumsiness, and cuteness but above all her cowlick and glasses. =) The only character I can't really put in words but loved was Chihaya. She's got a sorta diminutive quiet look to her that so contrasts her personality it really makes the things that come out of her mouth that more outrageous. They made her voice quiet but it clashed so much with the things she said as well as her enthusiasm for cosplay costumes. xD  
Overall though this series was really good. I'm glad to see that slice of life comedies even as what might seem as repetitive and boring as the workplace can still be hilarious in that repetition and when done with the right characters, right cast, and with decent art and story, makes for a highly enjoyable series that does slice of life comedy right.

    There are as much slice of life comedy shows in anime as there are zubats in a cave that sometimes you just want to spray repel on yourself just to avoid those annoying repetitive ones. That's mainly because SoL (Slice of Life) stories are easier to manipulate the audience's attention because we can easily relate to it. Think about it, which would you imagine yourself easier: You as a normal high school student gaining a large horde of girls that like you for no reason at all or being a super powered hero that has a lot of girls liking him for no particular reason? Ok jokes aside, people tend to enjoy light hearted shows more than those deep developing plots (I'm not referring to cleavages here just sayin') but that also means that the gags and jokes that would make a show funny would turn out repetitive and boring. In even worse cases, they tend to overuse a certain gag that the story turns out pointless and dragged on, causing more viewers to be bored instead of it's original purpose of entertaining. 
That's where we go to servant x service. The story is about a new civil servant named Yamagami Lucy (rest omitted lol) and her colleagues as they start out life as working adults in the civil service department. From there on, the show observes the happenings between work and personal relationships of each character. 
Sounds boring right? That's where you're going to be wrong. 
As common as the theme is (Working!!! already did this) the delivery of the story is splendid. Normally, SoL shows would have a very shallow story to give way to episodic events and the main focus would only be the main characters. SxS is not much different in terms of the focus but the story is a little bit (just a little bit) more deeper as you watch more episodes. Episodic as this show is, it also has a flowing story line which means that you really have to start watching the show in the proper order and not just skip episodes randomly to get the main idea. That's because there are certain plot twists in certain episodes that act as either for comedic reasons or for story development. 
Now let's get to the characters. The characters in SxS are really likable. There are negative points about them but then, later in the introduction episode, the story would show you a good side of them that will make you forget their bad side. That's one of the good points about the show. 
As for music and art style, they're generic as it gets. Nothing really to applaud but nothing to criticize either. Though, one of the enjoyments in this show is the expressions the ahoge (cowlick) of Yamagami makes whenever she's in a situation. 
I've pretty much covered everything here so let's now move on to the best part of this show: The enjoyment. 
This show is really fun. There's no episode that won't make you laugh at least once. The delivery of the gags (no matter how old and expected) is so natural. There's no forced gags here, and if there are they still have a little effect of fun for the audience. 
But the best enjoyment of all that you can receive is the sublime romantic progression in this show. It's not uncommon for SoL comedy shows to include a little romance teaser just for laughs but SxS takes it to the degree where you'll be rooting for the guy to give his all. 
And now this is something I'd like to specially mention. The ending. 
Most SoL shows leave in an open ended ending that would make most people rage for a new season just because of plot holes. SxS, however, answered all the questions it presented from the previous episodes and delivers a very fun and refreshing ending (along with some slight romantic progression haha). SxS ended like a closed book but you'll still want a new season just to further continue observing the misadventures of the civil servants you've grown to like throughout the show. 
And now for some final words. Yeah SoL shows are very common and most of them don't deviate from the norms but that doesn't mean that they don't have potential to be great. Even a zubat can become a crowbat if you give it proper training and love, right? (I'm just referring the training and love to the delivery of the story btw) Yes, they won't be able to compete with shows like Death Note and Code Geass but that's simply because they are in a different division. You can't pit a heavy weight boxer against a feather weight one after all. All in all, ServantxService doesn't really give much innovation in the SoL comedy genre but it's still enjoyable, fun, and interesting. 
As in what bakuman has stated ""A manga only needs to be interesting"" then that means an anime also just needs to be interesting and that's what SxS did. Showing the normal lives of normal people in an interesting and refreshing way.

    Woriking. A Romcom(Romantic Comedy) show which occoured in a certain ward office. if you have watched anime called ""Working!!"" then it makes it more easier for me to explain what kind of show it is. This anime is almost similiar to a certain anime called ""Working!!!"" 
The story was about three newcomers in the ward office; Hasabe, Yamagami and Miyoshi as the MC and that was when their life job started. The story was pretty much enjoyable and funny imo. There weren't really that much of a plot in the beginning. There were some introduction for new characters and digging up more into the character, to know better about the character. and later on around in the middle, there were some character development and it wasn't only occoured in one episode. The character development was already happening from the beginning and i really like how they made it that way while putting SoL and funny jokes in every episode.  
The animation imo, was pretty good. well considering they were focusing more on the character development, characterization and jokes, i'm guessing, maybe not enough budget so i'm thinking that the animation looked a little bit derp sometimes but despite that, i still like it. Especially when it comes to the sweet scene they were still made it looked cute and sweet.  
The BGM and Soundtrack were really good imo especially the OP song. Speaking about OP song, the animation visual in the OP was great imo. that was the reason why i thought the animation might be as good as the OP. the animation wasn't what i expected but i still like it. back to the Soundtrack, i think it was good. fit for the atmosphere imo. not that great but i think it was good enough for a Romcom show.  
The characters were funny, just gonna be honest. and imo, the characters were a little bit similiar with the character from a certain anime called ""Working!!"" (For example : Miyoshi and Hasabe) either on looks and personality. The comedy wasn't generic at all imo, or more like recycle comedy. i don't think that was the kind of comedy because i laugh so hard when i saw the comedy in this anime. The even put comedy which involves jobs (civil service), and it wasn't that hard to understand imo.  
Overall, it was a great show. really like how they executed the character development and characterization. it was sweet and cute imo. on the other side, it was an enjoyable show because of the comedy too. the plot sometimes were predictable but i still enjoy and like it despite that. 9/10 
Sorry for bad english. 
Hope my review can be helpful to you all.  
Thanks. Have a nice day

    Good shows are less popular and low ranked on MAL-this is the case of servant x service.  
The background of SxS is a government office where our main protagonists work. This anime is one of the very very few anime where we can see normal life style of normal people like us. It has no supernatural, fantasy, action, meaning less fighting and the story is quite paced. Romance is the main theme of SxS and it is matured kind of romance, not high school type, where boy is running after girl or vice versa. The episodes have gotten better and better as the series progressed. 
Lucy Yamagami, Yutaka Hasebe and Saya Miyoshi are appointed at the welfare department of the city where Taishi Ichimiya, Megumi Chihaya also work there and are their senior. Lucy is a shy, short heighted girl with huge breast, and there are some running gags regarding her breasts all over the series. Her full name is very long and its kind of wired. Her aim is to become a city officer and to meet the guy who passed her name on birth certificate and take revenge. She was bullied by others due to the wired name all along her life. Later it was revealed that it was Hasebe’s father who passed her name on birth certificate. She is often clueless about the inner meaning of the conversations and a bookwarm. Hasebe, on the other hand, is carefree type of guy; slaking off is the thing he do normally, though he is outstanding when it comes to handling customers. His hobby is to collect as many email as possible from girls. Lucy-Hasebe love relation is the prime focus of SxS. There is another love couple, Ichimiya and Chihaya; but they want to keep it a secret from others. Ichimiya is the oldest in the group and he has a sister Toko. He has the responsibility to raise her sister. Toko is suffering from brother complex and she keeps an eye on him so that no other woman, other than her, gets close to her elder brother. Chihaya is a clam girl; she is also a cosplay artist and dress designer. Chihaya and Ichimiya are in relationship for 2 years, whenever chihaya feels bored, she visits Ichimiyas house, play with Toko. Their bond is very strong but they keep distance from each other during office hours so that no one can suspect them as love birds. Chihaya wants Ichimiya to be a cool dude, who can speak romantically with her but Ichimiya is completely different. Their romance is the most realistic in SxS, even they kissed each other. Miyoshiis a college graduate and Jouji Tanaka is a banker and also school friend of Hasebe. There are hints that they may become lover in future.  
There isn’t a deep, meaningful story in SxS, but does it matter? You can laugh in every 2 minutes and the jokes are not repetitive. Movies, cartoons, television serials are all about enjoyment and SxS has 10/10 on this section. There is no aim or goal of the story but it has many sub plots which is the driving force of the episodes. 
Art is pretty good; it fits perfectly to the characters. The facial expressions of different characters are outstanding; this is where SxS won my heart. Sound is excellent though I didn’t like the OP.  
Overall, this anime is very enjoyable, a relaxing anime where the story is about normal people. Personally I love this kind of clam anime with nice ending. If you are into office romance then SxS is a must watching. 
Thank you very much for reading the review.

    Servant x Service 
Servant x Service is about 3 newcomers and 2 of their seniors working as civil servants. Here we have the 3 newcomers who are kinda weird. We have Hasebe, a smart guy who is always slacking off and getting the email addresses of girls for no reason, Miyoshi, a young woman who is shy, and lastly, Lucy Kimiko Akie Airi Shiori Rinne Yoshiho Ayano Tomika Chitose Sanae Mikiko Ichika... Yamagami, a young woman with a ridiculously long name who plans to take revenge by saying 'something' to the guy responsible for her having this long name. Then we have their fellow senior coworker, Chihaya, a cosplay lover, and their supervisor Ichimya, who thinks of himself as a big failure in almost everything. Servant x Service is all about the weird and funny worklife of these funny characters. 
Well, moving on. This series is one of the best in the department of comedy. A brilliant piece of work, I must say. The beautiful artwork along with fabulous comedy made this anime simply great. If you want a great story, you might be disappointed because this particular anime doesn't have those great stories found in many animes. But once you start watching this, it won't be long before you find out that there is no need for a great storyline here. This anime is perfect just the way it is. I'm not saying that animes with a good story are bad or anything, Servant x Service could be much better with a good story but it's also fun to watch without those great fancy storylines. They did keep the events sort of in sequence and in the end, used those things to give the series a good ending. 
Servant x Service is a great and fun to watch anime. It's just loaded with comedy. No scene was left to get too serious. Every scene was made funny one way or the other. A splendid job was done in keeping the mood light and funny. Even in scenes where characters were tense, depressed or serious, something was thrown in to keep things less serious and more funny. The amount of comedy this anime has is what makes it great. 
Enjoying an anime clearly depends on how you look at it. If you ask me, I just loved almost everything about this anime. If you are a comedy lover, Servant x Service won't disappoint you. :-)

    Well, got kinda confused after this anime. I wholeheartedly enjoyed quite simple, yet very good story, but... There was something that annoyed me. Or, should I say, SOMEONE. Chihaya and this Tanaka-guy often were soooo damn irritating. Especially Tanaka about this whole ""challenging"" Hasebe. The way this blockhead sees things and goes for them is something I hate personally. So self-concerned and going with lines such as ""The only thing I can do for Hasebe is to get girlfriend before him"", man what the hell, just give up already. Do you even think what you're saying?! Even Toko wasn't that obnoxious. She didn't leave an unpleasant feeling like those 2. Though I can't say that I understand why people would let this kid order and lecture them all the time. Besides that, all 13 episodes went by quickly for me, so I can recommend it with a smile. We've got a good look at normal people's lives, how do they interact, react and think. It's just a very good anime for an evening, that you'd like to spend enjoyable after all.

    STORY  
SxS is a simple slice-of-life comedy. It has its own unique setting with tons of hilarious moments and unexpected romance. Watching the characters develop and uncover certain truths about each other, makes this anime so much fun to watch. 
This is the type of anime where you come to love all of the characters because of their flaws. (That's all I'm saying! I'm not going to spoil!) 
ART/ ANIMATION 
Perfect. It was kept simple, which is perfect for this type of anime. At first glance it may look like nothing special, but don't let that put you off, its a typical/great setting for a slice-of-life anime. 
Neutral. The music was alright. The opening and ending songs didn't flow along with the episodes so it didn't really affect the anime in any way. 
OVERALL 10/10 
Loved it. I laughed my ass off. This has become one my favorite anime, thus the rating includes my personal bias. I recommend this to everyone as a must watch!

    Servant x Service is a slice of life anime written by Karino Takatsu who also made Working!! in a 4-coma manga adaptation. There is nothing else I can deny from both anime. Both of them, I think, have the same element about a slice of life with different themes, the restaurant & the office. You know, what is interesting in working in the office? I don’t see what the interests thing of the people that are serving in there or because to live their experiences with the wages that are very average. However, this anime reveals from a different perspective of how a civil servant lives their daily life with full of people who like to complain, swear the employee, a bit of romance, and a teddy bear that becomes your boss. I mean, this is serious and some people get that’s annoying. But, we will not focus on the teddy bear but this is a solid story from the life of the civil servant. 
Although Servant x Service took the theme of office employees, it’s not about anime that totally covers all elements of society and government. In this anime, you will not see the black-and-white side of an office employee but it’s more focused on the main character along with their complaints. With the theme as a civil servant, the premise is simple but is presented in such a way that doesn’t seem stiff, excessive in discussing the theme, and certainly in an unusual way. Yutaka Hasabe is a character that I think is the most carefree of all. His principle as if not want to appear with a genius look but he can do everything and almost nothing he can’t do. His cool, calm, relaxed, lazy on every the running gag. Moreover, he often foolish the main heroine, Lucy Yamagami even though this character has a very long name, I’ll just call her Lucy. Sometimes, Hasabe doesn’t often get out of his character so I think his character is not as balanced as the characters on the first impression. But, I don’t think as a shortcoming. Lucy is a serious-minded character but always made tense by the things around her. In addition, she doesn’t look too redundant with the clothes that he often wears but has the fanservice impression by the people who watch this anime. What I mean here are boobs. She has a plain trait until her innocence looks that’s always impersonated by other characters. Saya Miyoshi is a character that I don’t really see the privilege. However, the words that she often uttered always draw a depression so there are running gags in here. This character is also one of my experiences from one of the episodes that discussed with its saturation. I immediately realized that I also experienced this and it’s very affected in the heart for you who have felt it too. 
The art looks very dull to me. Although the studio that's working on the anime is A-1 Pictures which they worked on other popular anime such as Sword Art Online franchise, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Nanatsu no Taizai, and Fairy Tail, Servant x Service didn't seem to fascinate me to discuss this aspect. However, I don't think that this is one of the worse. The art is served as a slice of life anime in general like Working!! and it makes no difference. So I'll skip this. 
The opening is the best. Just like Working!!, Servant x Service with its opening song’s “May I Help You?” is so damn catchy. All singers are sung by the whole seiyuu of all heroines. I also don’t admire if there are so many seiyuu in this anime that come out of their characters that I often hear other than in this anime. For examples such as Tatsuhisa Suzuki who fills Yutaka Hasabe’s voice. His character at the time of filling the voice of this character is slightly different from other characters such as Ban from Nanatsu no Taizai and Hiroomi Nase from Kyoukai no Kanata. Just like Ai Kayano and Aki Toyosaki. Ai Kayano with Lalatina Dustiness Ford from KonoSuba and Shiro from No Game No Life. While Aki Toyosaki with Yui Hirasawa from K-ON! But, this doesn’t change my opinion about this anime because there are so many popular seiyuu that brought in this anime. 
I'm enjoying the whole story in this anime. I don't really think that this anime has its own flaws because I'm aware, watching this thing is like it's time to turn your brain off. Some anime like this as I want to refresh my brain who has often watched anime with the complex story. This is one anime that doesn't make me regret a bit because I'm enjoying the whole episode. 
Servant x Service is an anime slice of life with humor and gag that’s funny. Not too funny but it sure will make you laugh. Sometimes, we watch too many complex stories and we certainly want to turn the brain off. But, this is something that I like. Uplifting the theme as an office worker with an experience of peers and pain as well as some romance spice in it. Other popular seiyuu make this anime add value to its plus. With a very catchy and memorable opening song like the slice of life anime in general, Servant x Service has actually gone beyond what I expect.

    A slice of life anime based off of people working as civil servants. Servant x Service explores the daily lives of the people working as civil servants and what they go through. There is no general plot but the show is wholesome and good. While watching this, this made me want to work as a civil servant in Japan. The romance in this isn't heavy but it is present and the comedy is very fair. A good anime that's only 13 episodes and definitely worth the watch. I personally enjoyed it very much and would rewatch if I had time.

    Sevant x Service surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. I expected it to be your usual slice of life -- entertaining, but nothing special. However, while it may not have been the best show in existence, it was certainly worth the watch and I'm disappointed there isn't a second season. 
Story: 7/10 
The story was pretty average; a group of people working as civil servants and helping others. It focused on their relationships with each other without getting too overly dramatic, and to be frank, it was awfully cute. I especially enjoyed Hasebe and Lucy's relationship as the story progressed. 
Art: 7/10  
The art style was plain and simple, which is a good thing for sol's. There weren't really any intricate character designs, but each one was distinguishable.  
I really enjoyed the characters in this show. There wasn't any extreme character development, but it was subtle enough to make a slight difference. Towards the end, most of them matured in some sort of way and their relationships with one another were much clearer than they were in the beginning. 
I really enjoyed it, honestly. I'm not usually a fan of slice of life anime because they tend to bore me, but this one was quite entertaining. It had humor and romance and it was just a good show in general. 
I thought it was a really cute show and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's pacing was good and it didn't overdo anything. I recommend it if you're looking for a feel-good anime without much of a plot.

    I've watched this series not long ago and I realized I didn't make any comments in one of the best comedies out there despite the low ranking given from many users... 
Story:  The story follows the daily life of a group of people in the civil service department. Each one of them is assigned to different tasks and as the day passes they get to know each other working and that's where the fun begins. Since this series genre is classified as comedy/slice of life, there's not much  attention to the plot which is what most people tend to avoid but that's a big mistake, as the story progresses the more you pay attention, the more you laugh and I must admit, sometimes is hysterically funny. For an office-environment type of anime and as an current office employee myself, this show excels my expectations.(10/10) 
Animation:  Same animation as Working!. A-1 pictures delivers a great art style again and it fits ServantxService well for what it is to. The budget for a comedy anime ain't that big to begin with so I guess this is fair enough.(8/10) 
Character: Individually, the characters are quite unique and lovely. Starting from the   stupid and cute Lucy, the slacker Hasebe, the charming/ passive Saya, the cosplayer Megumi and the clumsy supervisor Ichimiya, Each of them has its own personality and  that's what make them interesting when they interact to each other. I like them a lot (10/10) 
Music/Soundtrack: Not the biggest forte here but undoubtedly enjoyable to my ears, starting from the crazy opening song through the charming ending song. (8.5/10) 
This anime could be considered a Working! 2.0 since is more mature and it's got a better writing than its predecessor. The only reason I considered this a 'masterpiece' is due to personal preference(even though I know in a global scale it is not) and for the 'original' work setting established, not all the time you get to see that. Overall 10/10

    Office comedies. Not very many people can think about this genre of comedy without thinking of heavy hitters like the two Offices (UK and US) and to a lesser extent, Parks and Recreation. Now, there seems to be a series that tries to take the office lives of Japanese civil servants and turn it into a comedy. Does it succeed? Let's find out. 
Story: 7  
The story of SxS is relatively episodic as it follows the various members of a staff of civil servants, as well as their crazy families and friends. Episodes range from a kidnapped boss to meeting the grandson of a talkative old lady among other things. There are no fight scenes, just brief bursts of comedy, as if the story was a string of 4 - komas (which I would imagine it might be since the series was originally a 4 - koma manga). That doesn't mean that the series doesn't flow. Quite the contrary, the series maintains a steady pace throughout (except the end, more on that latter) and the comedy comes at regular intervals. Comedy is usually up to the individual, but the series does a good job at covering a variety of audiences, allowing it to stretch past audience limitations that its highschool comedy counter parts suffer from.  
It must be said though that the series seemed to rush at the end in terms of the romantic sub-plot. The problem with it is that it doesn't reach a satisfying conclusion. It wouldn't be necessarily a bad thing if it wasn't the central focus of the last few episodes but to not get a concrete ending after all the hinting and nudging in the right direction is a real shame.  
Art 8 
The animation is done by A-1 pictures and can be expected to be above average quality. The character designs are down to earth, as to be expected from an office comedy but with an anime twist. The opening has a nice surreal feeling to it, with odd imagery contrasting with the character's somewhat dull work environment.  
Sound 7  
The acting is solid, with the voices of Chihaya and the section manager taking the gold. There must be more weight given to such good performances since the show is a conversational one, so a good vocal cast is a necessity. On the flip side, BGMs aren't entirely remarkable and the ending doesn't do anything to help the series. That being said, the opening is catchy and captures the hectic nature of the lives of these particular people, which is a plus.  
Character 8  
Each main character has their own quirks that separates them from any apparent stereotypes they may bring to mind, making this cast a unique one. Lucy is a somewhat shy girl who loves to read but really hates her name. Miyoshi is the voice of reason but has a tendency to talk more than she needs to. Chihaya is a avid cosplayer that can spit acid with the best of them. Hasebe is a slacker that soon gets the hots for one of these females. The list continues. The side characters are decent as well, but if the side characters got some more character development (especially the section manger), this feature could've been an even bigger asset.  
Some of these characters, you will hate. Others, you will love. Because of this polar nature, it comes down to personal preference. However, regardless of what others may say, these characters are anything but generic.  
Enjoyment 8  
Whether during lunch break or after school, dawn or midnight, SxS is sure to give a bellyful of laughs. While it may trip up on some of the more serious aspects it has, its wide range of comedy makes it enjoyable to almost any anime fan regardless of experience or age.  
Overall 8  
The story has enough laughs to make up for its hiccups. The art is clean and crisp, as to be expected from A-1 Pictures. Sound isn't a strong part of the series but its opening and vocal cast are very good. The characters each have a dash of uniqueness, making them relatable buffoons rather than cardboard cut outs with different colors.  
Give this anime a chance and it'll be sure to serve you well.

    The story revolves around the daily lives of employees in a government office building in the fictional city of Mitsuba, Hokkaido. 
Errr... Yeah that’s pretty much it really. I first started watching this when i started my first full time job in the summer last year and this show came in at the right time and I was hoping to have something to relate to in my new and exciting career. What was to follow would be a boring, tedious and exhausting show much like my job. So let’s get cracking.  
So we are introduced to our main characters Lucy Kimiko Akie Airi Shiori Rinne Yoshiho Ayano Tomika Chitose Sanae Mikiko Ichika... Yamagami. By the way that is just the name of our main heroine. Let’s call her Lucy for short. Yutaka Hasebe and Saya Miyoshi who are all starting their first day working as civil servants.  
The major problem with the series is that there is only so much you can make out of an office/work life anime. The characters are supposed to be the ones giving depth to the show regardless of its boring premise. If strong, well developed and comedic characters are present then the show could be more enjoyable. Unfortunately that’s not the case here. The show has no general direction and stuff is thrown into the mix in hopes of making it better. I.e. an introvert boss that controls a robotic rabbit.  
The end result is awful and really it’s not the shows fault. I should have seen it coming, a show about office life. How in any way is it possible to make it entertaining? Well… ‘The office’ and ‘The U.S office’ come to mind.  
Lucy is the shy and low guarded bookworm who has a clear motive as to why she became a civil servant in the first place. TO TAKE REVENGE ON THE MAN WHO GAVE HER THAT NAME… no seriously. Lucy hates the long name given to her and wants to find out who permitted this name; rather than talk to her parents about why they wanted to give her this long title. I also heard that’s its possible to apply for a name change… Not off to a good start Lucy. Her reasons for working as a civil servant are ludicrous and to be honest it’s just petty which makes her character salty and unlikeable.  
Yutaka Hasebe is a more outgoing, happy-go-lucky guy who is rather competent at what he does due to a long history of his family working as civil servants. He is a bit of a wannabe player who asks girls for their e-mails… maybe player was the wrong word here. He seems to be a genuinely nice guy who cares about his friends and colleagues, proven in the case where he stops his drunken friend from dragging Saya around. I don’t particularly like him as a person as his personality can be irritating and he does seem like a passive aggressive person. 
The last is Saya who is the less spoken character which reflects upon her personality. She gets less screen time than the other afro mentioned, but to be honest nothing really comes of it. While she is a nice lady, respectable and level headed she can be quite bland. That pretty much sums up her character.  
The art is rather simple and nothing extraordinary and it’s probably one of the better points about this show. Considering it’s from A1 pictures the studio that created works such as Sword art online, Togainu no chi, Blue exorcist and others, (I can’t believe they made this crap) animation was never a problem.  
The soundtrack wasn’t great. It had this whacky and upbeat kind of tone which isn’t really suited to my music tastes.  
I did not like Servant x Service. This is one of the shows that I can straight out say it was boring and not worth your time. To be honest I’ll be surprised if there’s a big following of this series. I would not recommend this to anyone. Even those working office jobs will be left scratching their heads like I was. 
Better recommendations would be: 
Hataraku Maou-sama! an anime about the devil working part time in McDonalds. Contains more fantasy elements.  
Golden time. Which a romance/comedy based in college. Contains more drama elements than Servant x Service.  
Among those two you’ll find something better than servant x Service.  
Thanks for reading guys, any feedback is welcome. Have a nice day!

    This is an office comedy. It stars a small cast of young adults (Lucy, Hasebe, Chihaya, Miyoshi, and Ichimiya) all with their own unique quirks. There's a bit of romance, but mostly office antics that keep the story moving at a steady pace until the end of its 13 episode run. Think of it as Japan's answer to The Office of England and North America. There will be characters that you look forward to watching, and some that irk you every time they're on screen. And of course it wouldn't be Japanese without a talking animal, which comes in the form of a stuffed bunny boss. They work in the social service sector, but the setting is really only a backdrop, 
with the action of the characters amongst themselves being the plot driver. It's a good relatable scenario for anyone who would consider themselves affiliated with the josei genre, so if you're looking for a more mature comedy anime this would be a good choice. 
My opinion of the story is that is a light enjoyable plot that never gets too serious. It deals with relatable office scenarios that anyone in the service sector will know, as well as a couple relationship woes (that aren't as relatable). It has a steady pace that never has too many deep catalysts, and is typically resolved within the 20 minute period of each episode. So don't expect too much depth. You might be surprised by how admirable some of the characters are given certain scenarios, so at least to a degree you'll find yourself excited to see how the characters function within the plot. The comedy of course is effective, you'll find yourself laughing on multiple occasions, but probably not a whole lot. It had moments, but not monumentally hilarious ones. I guess that's a part of what Japanese comedy is, some things just don't translate over. That said, it is still a office romance comedy at heart. The story gets an 7.5 out of 10. Not stellar, but certainly enjoyable. 
As I mentioned earlier, all the characters are quirky and interesting. My personal favourite was Chihaya, but I think the effectiveness of this show is how everyone will like someone different for different reasons. Briefly, Lucy is the nerdy, coming out of her shell character that ends up being the prime love interest. Hasebe is the endearing slacker who spends the whole season trying to win Lucy over. Miyoshi is a quiet somewhat closeted person who ends up in the toughest situations. Chihaya is the otaku seamstress who has a fiery personality and Ichimiya is the hopeless naive supervisor who is whipped by his younger sister. There are other minor characters of little interest, but what makes this anime strong is the banter among them. Their quirks offer interesting situations with some unpredictable outcomes. The characters get an 8.5 out of 10. Likeable, interesting, and well-developed, you'll find yourself wanting more from them after the 13th episode. 
Presentation 
Lastly the presentation should be addressed, because I feel this is another facet to this anime that made it effective. The opening and ending songs are both catchy, and I found myself looking forward to hearing them each week. The voice actors are all really effective, with prominent seiyu such as Suzuki, Tatsuhisa which I recognized from some of my top animes including Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun. The art is spectacular in the opening, but somewhat lack luster in the show itself. Sometimes it's great, other times it feels kind of cheaply done. I don't expect very much from a comedy slice-of-life series, but coming off of Working! there was already enough fanbase to warrant a bit more work on the animation end in my opinion. The manga has a similarly low budget look to it, so I guess there's not tons to work off of here. Either way, I was a little disappointed. However, all in all the presentation gets a 7.5 out of 10. There were strong points of the presentation that made up for the weaknesses in others, giving it this solid score. 
Final Thoughts 
For the josei genre there is a disparagingly large void of animes to keep a young woman watching shows that relate to her. Servant x Service will help to shrink that void, even if just a little, as it is truly a seinen/josei series. Appealing to both the sexes there's something for everyone, and I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a good watch or read. Compiling the score, Servant x Service gets a final score of 7.8 out of 10. For a comedy/romance it does a good job of keeping you entertained, and will leave you wanting more by its finale. Luckily the manga exists that can remedy that for anyone looking to get some more of Lucy x Hasebe! It's still an ongoing manga so expect more in the future, and while you're waiting, watch the show.

    Do you miss that always fun show ""Working !"" ? or maybe you would like to light up your mood a little bit ? Or maybe you just want to have some good old laughs... If you can see yourself in any of the previous scenarios, Servant x Service or simply SxS is what you are looking for. 
Servant x Service is simply the most ""sitcomesque"" like anime I've ever watched, it resembles a sitcom in various ways, and I will demostrate that in the lines below. ( By the way, if you do not know what is a sitcom, it stands for situational comedy, and it is a expression used to designate some american tv shows, like ""Friends"" and ""How I Met Your Mother""). 
First of all, what is SxS about ? and how does every episode plays out ? 
SxS tells the story of the interactions between co-workers of a ward office speciallized in health and welfare. It does not have a major plot, but instead it carries the episodes out based on two main points : occasional comics situations, and romantic (light-mooded may I add) interactions between the characters, which is basically the formula for most sitcoms nowadays. 
Ok, but just because it is following a formula it does not mean it is good, how does the execution of such formula goes ? 
It goes pretty smoothly actually. Here is where one of the main points of SxS shines, that is the characters (again, almost every sucessful sitcom is so because of good characters). The characters are reallly well put together, and their interactions is almost always hilarious or sweet. 
But who are these so interesting characters ? 
Well, the main cast consists of the megane big breasted Lucy Kimiko Akie Airi Shiori Rinne Yoshiho (...) Yamagami, a cheerful and innocent girl who has a passion for books and hates her abnormally long name. 
Secondly we got Lucy's romance interest, the hilarious Hasebe, by far the best constructed character of the anime, he is usually too cheerful and careless, but we can say he is basically much more than meets the eyes. 
We also got Chihaya, Myoshi and Ichimya as part of the main cast, all of them having great nuances to their personalities, do not be fooled by the first few episodes, they may seem as cliche one dimensional character but they are definetly not. 
Through the whole anime the viewer is rewarded with hilarious situations between these characters every episode (it gets even better as the series progresses ) and the romance was a really good surpirse, it progressed extremely naturally,did not felt rushed at any point, and had perfect pacing... again it resembles any sucessful sitcom out there. 
The rest of the characters, the supporting cast if you will, are ok. Here we can find a few annoying characters (yes I'm looking at you Touko), but some good ones as well... nothing that will stand out (for good or for bad), but then again, they are not supposed too... a sitcom is all about the main cast, and dragging the attention or screen time away from them would be foolish, luckly it appears the writers of SxS are well aware of that. 
Allright, seems good, but what about the more tecnical parts of the anime ? how does the art and sound goes ? 
Well in the art department SxS comes through as well, of course we are not talking about a Mecha-Eplosions-Gunfire anime, therefore no specially good effect is required. That being said, the quality of the ""normal"" part of the art (color pallete, drawings, etc) is pretty standarly good.  
The character design does not stand out either (with the exception of lucy, but only because she fits in cliche design). I 'm not saying they are poorly designed, after all they are supposed to be normal working people, therefore we could not expect much unusal innovative design here. 
As for the sound in the anime, again it does not stands out, but again it does not have to. The OP was the only catchy song in the whole anime, really great cheerfu song (thanks again mrs Toyosaki), the ED was sweet, but it didnt stand out much, and the SDT was nnot remarkable at all, once again it resembles a sitcom, trying its best not to drive attention away from the characters. 
And there you have it, a sitcom in anime format. Personally I loved it, I always liked sitcoms and animes, puting them together was a terrific idea, but as any other genres out there some people will enjoy it and some wont.  
Now all that is left is to ask yourself, ""Will I like this ?"", Remember all that I said above, this anime consists basically comedy oriented with a bit of light romance, with no major plot, dark themed stuff, or twists. If you think you'll dig it, I say go ahead, you will get a delightful, smile maker experience. If you dont, well there is always something else out there right ?

    There is a recurring issue with many slice-of-life shows that predominantly feature comedy: a tendency to neglect clear development in the narrative. The result of this lack of plot progression is that the humour soon becomes repetitive and events that take place can become almost painfully predictable, particularly if this show focuses on a smaller cast of characters, or even a single character (yes WataMote, I am talking to you). Static characters and predictable gags are the bane of comedy, while surprise, suspense, anticipation and variation are the sugar that can make it oh-so-sweet. 
Taking these factors into account, it is evident that Servant x Service is probably one of the best comedy anime of recent years, and one of the few I can work up the enthusiasm to follow on a weekly basis (unlike most other comedies of the Summer 2013 season, which, except WataMote, I dropped almost immediately). With a solid cast of simple, likeable characters with quirky personalities, this show is possibly one of the best ways to kill a few hours.  
The episodes are typically split into 2 segments, each one depicting a smaller subplot, while also keeping the overarching narrative intact and ensuring genuine development (which is most evident in the primary ""Lucy x Hasebe"" romance and secondary ""Chihaya x Ichimiya"" subplot). This, along with the large cast, ensures that the humour is surprising and unpredictable. By telegraphing future plot points (known in film and TV as ""planting causes for future effects""), a sense of anticipation develops that keeps you watching, as you find yourself keen to see how events will pan out. This is all a perfect example of how comedy in any medium is done. 
Aesthetically, there isn't much to report. We have a largely conventional (but acceptable) art style, which flows well and ensures that character models are consistent and easy to watch. The opening is catchy, but it isn't a fine example of music, and the ending's a pretty easy-going and pleasant track. Voice acting is good (though we do get to hear Taketatsu Ayana as a tsundere-imouto, which has now been done about as many times as the sun setting in the evening, though I suspect this was deliberate). 
So in the end, the otherwise mediocre Summer 2013 season produced a gem in an unlikely genre, as the oft-muddied comedy conventions get a well deserved polish. I can rarely claim to enjoy straight-comedies, but this is probably my favourite show of the past few years.

    Working is no easy task. In fact, getting by every single day with a job is something we all want especially in today's world of recession. With the current economy era, it's best to work hard and keep up with your job hoping you don't hear the two forbidden words known as 'you're fired!' For three certain newcomers, they've become new employees at a Health and Welfare Department of a certain government office at a certain city in Hokkaido. In Servant x Service, we get to see an insight look on what it's like to work in such an environment and their daily lives. 
The series is based off of a 4-Koma of the same name written by Karino Takatsu. She is the same author who wrote Working!! Therefore, expect some similar themes. With A-1 Pictures behind the production, it's easy to get a similar vibe for both series. However, there are some more noticeable factors in Servant x Service that makes it enjoyable especially for those looking something refreshing to watch. 
For starters, the series takes place in a working environment. However, it takes place at a government office so don't expect butlers, maids, or call-girls. Instead, expect professionals dressed in suits and ties along with a formal image of the business class. After all, these jobs require more skills than flipping burgers. Rather, it puts them into an environment where the employees have to work to ensure the better quality of the public.  
As characters goes, we see a noticeable age range. Even by appearances, we can tell that the majority of the character cast consists of young adults or middle aged folks who already completed school through graduation, and are now working adults. In other words, they are now fully independent and no longer depends on their parents for support. However, what they do need is support from each other especially for the newcomers. A particular example is the main female protagonist Lucy (her name is too damn long so I'll just refer to her as Lucy). As one of the new comers, Lucy is the babyface. She is often the target of pranks but has the determination to work hard on her job. This is especially true in the beginning as she seems to struggle quite a bit in the working environment. Otherwise, we also got the other newcomers such as Yutaka Hasebe that is almost entirely the opposite of the Lucy's character. He is usually carefree and flirtatious while making awkward jobs out of nowhere. Hasebe is also one of the character that is hard to read because of his sarcastic nature. Nonetheless, it's clear to see that the two are contrasting characters. Finally, there's Saya Miyoshi, a newcomer with shy nature but a gentle personality that seems to create a sort of balance between the duo. 
Perhaps one of the stronger dynamics and entertainment factor of Servant x Service revolves around the character interactions. Everyone seems to be so different and it's fun to see how their life is like at a working environment. Unlike at school, there's no homework, projects, or lectures. Instead, there's just work to be done that requires skill of their profession. However at many times, we see that some of the characters don't take their work at seriously as some others. Then, there's also some of that 'office romance' going on. This is especially true between co-workers Ichimiya and Chihaya. The noticeable factor though is that the female is the more dominant character here. Given Chihaya's straight forward personality, she brings out the more demanding side of a couple. Coupled by the fact that she loves to co-splay while off work, Chihaya makes the cutting edge of a co-worker. Oh and of course, romance can't be complete without drama so enter Ichimiya's little sister. Long story short, expect humorous drama in this series that can be somewhat awkward to watch. 
The office environment that we picture and see in real life is expected to be filled with boredom. However, it is surprising that Servant x Service turns it into a more of an entertainment zone. For instance, there's a little supernatural twist added that comes as a small package of stuffed rabbit. Even with the supernatural element, it moves along the line of realism at many cases. Then, there's also fun to see how people really do work as social workers. At the same time though, this series may strike as repetitive. Most of us watching this show might be working already or at one point in our lives held a part-time or full-time job. In other works, Servant x Service might be a bothersome reminder of how work feels like especially if you just came home after a long day to watch this show. It could even be worse for people who doesn't have a job and struggling to obtain one in this tough economic world as of today. 
The show has a lot of humor like I've mentioned before. Besides the absurdly long titles of each episode and some of the characters' names, there's also misunderstandings. These misunderstandings usually pokes at the relationships between the employees. Touko Ichimiya in particular often puts herself in the center of misunderstandings and it's almost non-sensual fun to watch her behave at a professional work area. Furthermore are setups to certain yet unexpected events at various points in the series. There's just this sense of parody going on that plays around the relationships between the various characters. Additionally, there's references of other familiar anime to spot here and there. Oh and don't forget the fun challenges at the end of each episode that requires a little brain power. At some points though, the humor might become a bit dry. While reality series such as The Office often pokes fun at popular culture, Servant x Service focuses more on its own dynamics that can be a bit stale. The comedy of this show sometimes feels like it's trying too hard as in a way that is almost forceful at times. 
As artwork goes, the series is designed to look realistic in terms of the characters. All of them look simple with nothing too stand out. Besides the supernatural element, all the characters are dressed in a professional way. Lucy plays more of the role as Ms. Fanservice with her large breast size. Her innocence though is quite cute to watch given her fresh status as a new employee. Chihaya is also designed to look like the girlfriend with her aloof personality. Her cosplay designs brings out a different side of her though. The office itself looks ordinary also looks quite simple, realistic, and to the point as it should be. 
The music and soundtrack is standard to its theme. However, the OP song “May I Help You?” is very noticeable with its montage and tone. The way some of the VA sings the song makes it even more catchy as it feels alive through their voices. Speaking voices, I give praise to both Lucy (Ai Kayano) and Chihaya (Aki Toyosaki) for their performance. Both of them stands out as the strengths that gives them a more realistic way of women at work. Touko's voice also turns sounds surprisingly real that fits with her tsundere like behavior. Voiced by Rumi Ookubo, her skills can be comparable to Rie Kugimiya, another famous VA well known for playing various characters of the tsundere nature. 
Overall, Servant x Service is a decent watch and something to take notice at. Don't take the title the wrong way as it's not about a master and its servant. Rather, it's about how we see employees at work and what they do. Everything looks simple and it's fun to poke at how they behave between each other. If humor in a working environment is something you're looking for, then this show is definitely something that should be on your PTW. It doesn't have maids or a sword wielding woman like Working!! does but what it does have is a fun way of presenting the work environment. After a long day of work or school, this show would like to service you.

    The first 2 episodes were very funny, I was dying at some points. Certainly take your time to watch these side Prince of Tennis shows because they provide a lot of background history on some important characters and show how they came about. It's just as the title says ""Past and Future"". 
P.S. The OVA Bonus that has the same title as this one but with OVA Bonus on the end and only has 2 episodes is actually identical in material to this title's episodes. The OVA Bonus is actually the first 2 episodes of this title. Regardless, enjoy the content, it's great.

    Basically the backstory of how all the main characters in Kyoukai no Kanata met. This may be the prequel to the series story wise but I would watch Kyoukai no Kanata first. Everything will make much more sense in this if you watch the main series first. Plus some of this may be considered spoilers to events in Kyoukai no Kanata. 
The story mainly focuses on the Nase family, Hiroomi and Mitsuki in particular, and how they become involved with Kanbara. The majority of the other main characters from Kyoukai no Kanata are in this special as well. 
I always enjoy seeing backstories for characters, and this special did just that exceptionally well. It was never explained how Hiroomi and Mitsuki met Kanbara in Kyoukai no Kanata which was nice to finally see in this special.

    ""W-what's the matter, aniki?"" 
That's when Hiroomi realized that his little sister has entered her rebellious stage. 
Okay, as we all know, Kyoukai no Kanata was definitely a good anime. It had its proper amount of fanservice, action, drama and even some touching romance between kouhai and senpai. This OVA is exactly the same. 
The difference between the parent story and this OVA is that Hiroomi plays the lead role and we discover how his relationship with Akihiko began. It also explains the somehow vague beginning of the parent story. 
The art was as captivating as ever. Kyoto Animation keeps up the good work of providing us with good eye candy. 
The OP & ED haven't changed, but maybe that's a good thing, because of that, this OVA didn't really feel like an OVA and more like a part of the parent story.  
Hiroomi is the main character and the origin of the scars on his upper body get their explanation. And then we have Mitsuki. We know her as the 'kuudere' type, but suprisingly she isn't in this OVA. She still calls Hiroomi ""onii-chan"" and warms the hearts of the spectators.  
Enjoyment? What? Do I even have to explain why I enjoyed it? Well, see for yourself and I'm sure you can answer this question yourself.  
All by all, a great OVA which doesn't really feel like one, but at the same time it is.

    This OVA was definitely something I didn't know I needed until it was given to me. It's action-packed, serious, with the occasional ""onii-chan!"" to fill the empty spaces. It feels like the first arch of the anime all over again, lacking the unneeded fanservice that accompanied the episodes after the Hollow Shadow. I myself, was ecstatic.  
The OVA really delves into Akihito's past before the series, making up for the backstory that he had, but never touched on, in the anime. But what it really revolves around is Akihito's dream in the beginning of episode 2 of the anime, tying itself in at that point. While the OVA is told from Hiromi's perspective, it does include almost all the main characters of the anime, with the infamous Izumi-Miroku rooftop battles, and even a debut of our bespectacled beauty.  
The only odd thing about this episode was its title, ""Shinonome."" It differs from the rest of the episodes, whose titles revolve colors, ie: ""Moonlight Purple, Bitter Orange"", Shinonome means ""early dawn,"" meaning when the eastern sky begins to show light before the sun appears. This may have to do with colors if you look at it the right way, but while we're being straightforwards, it does not have much to do with colors.  
All in all, this OVA was outstanding. The topic of the OVA was something many people longed for during the series, the anticipation of the story somehow tying in an explanation finally taking form. It's definitely a must see for all fans of the show, and really brings you back to the original storytelling of Kyoukai no Kanata.

    This anime is a very late adaptation of the manga ""Notari Matsutarō"" which received 1978's Seinen Shogakukan Manga Award. The author Tetsuya Chiba worked on Ashita no Joe with Ikki Kajiwara. Both Matsutaro and Joe are against conformism and started as real jerk, but their paths are different. 
Art : 5/10 
Nothing special, it is kind of retro-type. 
Sound : 5/10 
Pretty classic. 
Story&Character 9/10 (they are meant to be together): 
It's an adaptation, and the original story started in 1973. It was very rare back then in Japan to have anti-hero as main character. The story is only about Matsutaro, a man that represent every ""failures"" in japanese society. The sumo universe is respected, nothing more to say about it, the sport side isn't very deepened. In order to really appreciate, I had to keep in mind that everything in this story is symbolic. Getting into the action would cause most people to hate the main character, and find it boring as it lacks of charismatic foes, serious competition and structured plot. Talking about plot, in my opinion it is this simple : 
Matsutaro, against all others characters who represent society. Every other characters are just here to tell his story. If he acts like a rebel, it's because he never felt the need of being part of society, only Reiko made him want to get in it. Let's make it simple, He wants one thing from society, but isn't willing to do something for it, and the sumo is the only thing that can make the deal.  
In order to understand Matsutaro, put aside all the ""good/bad"" notions, and everything that society taught us. Like every human, what he want the most is living a happy life as he sees it : sleeping, eating, and being free with Reiko, in his case it's everything that matters to him.  
What I tought was awesome with him is that everything that you can hate in this guy is something that society taught you to hate. In fact, he is even with others human, just too different to be understood by some people. This man doesn't have any knowledge nor morality, but he's logic in his acts and honest with himself and others. I'd even say he's more clever than most people, optimizing everything in his life in order to make it better, he'd rather live happy than looking nice for others.  
Some people would say that the story is about conformism and the evolution of a rebel, but I don't totally agree with them. I think it's more than just that, there is something simpler and better : Road to happiness. 
Enjoyment : 8/10 
It remind me of when I tried to figure out which was better between FMA and FMAB, one more mature, the other more into action. 
I had to look at it three times to finally get it : 
1st time : this is pretty bad, oh wait it's not a shounen !; 
2nd : It's not that bad, but I feel strange, as if I missed something; 
3rd : How could I be so stupid to not understand how good it was; 
I then bought the manga version in order to be sure I wasn't wrong.  
It may looks like an ordinary sports anime, but if you turn on your brain while watching and try really hard to understand, this is GOLD. I don't think much people could really appreciate it since it looks really simple and childish yet so subtile and clever that it gave me headaches. 
The few things I didn't like were all those scripting arrangements to make you hate the character that were not into the manga. Even the studio didn't really understood it all, he's not supposed to be hot-tempered and bad just for being like that. It was very counter productive because most people will not understand that Matsutaro is more than a evolving-jerk. 
Overall : 8/10 
This anime is very similar to Joe wich I enjoyed, but so much more clever. I admit that it is due to the fact that Joe was the pioneer, but Matsutaro could almost be another version of Joe, more mature and realistic. It's really too bad that art and sound were too classic, and with the few errors in Matsutaro's behaviour, it can get really confusing for the one that expected something more ""seinen-ish"". 
If you want a good plot, action, rivalry & shonen stuff, no manga culture : not for you; 
If you are able to enjoy a smart show without getting every references : it's worth a try; 
If you love having headaches after thinking to much : then it is for you.

    DOSUKOI! 
Ok, so far nobody hasn't made a review of this retro type of anime, well, we all know that its manga version ""Notari Matsutarou""  was started in the 70's and ended in the late 90's and I can't blame anybody for probably having some lack of interest of anime since it has a rather slow progression and underrated, so I'm gonna give my ratings as to this anime's category, but take note that I'm gonna subject this review for updating on its last episode which right now (9/29/14), so here are my ratings, DOSUKOI!!!!: 
Take note that this is an updated review, co'z when I made this review it was after watching  episode 20. 
Story: Fair 6. DOSUKOI!!! 
Well, I give it a ""Fair"" score since the anime itself has a slow progression and pretty much random, but it still provides some aspect of entertainment where at one point I would like to see an ending where I would like to see Matsutarou getting owned big time and on the second is where I see his entertaining side where ,pretty much this anime's story plot rides on his journey and misadventure of being a Sumo wrestler which is why this part gets a 6 in my opinion, so as for my update of this anime for its last episode I will retain the score of 6. 
Art: Decent 4. DOSUKOI!!! 
Obvious enough, that this anime's art was pretty much retro in today's standard but it is still artistic in such a way. So I'm keeping the score the way it is.   
Sound and Character: Good 7. DOSUKOI, DOSUKOI!!! 
For the sound, the score is for the opening theme and for the VAs who did Matsutarou, Tanaka and Reiko's voice, since the anime has a seinen genre, so typically this anime is for the more older audience, so in such aspect the mature voices really does match this anime as a whole. The opening theme ""Dosukoi Jinse"" really does depict the life of a rowdy wrestler like Matsutarou  , which was another reason why this anime's sound deserves a 7.The characters, ok so this is all about Matsutarou and Matsutarou alone, but let's not forget about Tanaka who is the one who keeps the main character in somewhat ""in check,"" frankly as odd as it is the score is more for Tanaka than for Matsutarou, since he has to take up the burden of putting Matsutarou back on his track. Matsutarou, on the other hand really is one character that I like to hate, though, I did said that he is entertaining, I did said that he's is a character that I wanna see get owned and after watching the last episode I'm happy as to how things went for him (I'm not gonna put the spoilers, co'z I don't want them mods on my back) , now on Reiko, I would have wish that she has more aired time but alas she only limited to just a few moments with the main character, Matsutarou, also, she one character where I don't like to end up with Matsutarou and I'm glade she didn't. Let's face it, a nice girl like Reiko being with Matsutarou is like a girl marrying a guy who is a wife beater. I also like the scene where she walks away from Matsutarou, since it kinda made him a more matured person in a rude awakening way. 
Enjoyment: Good 7. DOSUKOI!!! 
What makes me enjoy this anime was the simple wish that I get to see Matsutarou getting owned, that is if he does get owned in any of the upcoming episodes and I'm glade he did, so I hereby change my score from 6 to 7 since I like the way how it ended. 
Overall: From Decent 4 to very good 8. DOSUKOI!!! 
All I can say is that when watching this anime one would hate the main character, Matsutarou at one point and on the next one would find him entertaining, also, I've change my score from a 4 to a 8, since in the end getting see him growing up.......late in his life, has made me change my score for this anime's overall 
DOSUKOI!!!!

    Despite the art being like the storyline, pretty boring and generic, this season was after all better than the first one. 
This season, I found myself disliking the protagonists of the show and did not care much at the end if they'd survive or not. I see nearly 0 character development and all the characters in the show seem very flat and uninteresting with the exception of Shinoa and Mitsuba, having somewhat of a background worth thinking about. They all kept speaking and acting in this very obvious (sometimes obnoxious) and specific way which kept the story very uninteresting and predictable.  
Secondly, the plot does not make any sense from time to time. Some characters act very unrealistically. Like, there are multiple characters who frequently keeps disobeying the commands but are yet still allowed to participate in the battle (You can guess who). You are given no sense of time elapses and the plot overall was just confusing and a big mess with major plot holes. 
Sadly, I did not notice any great musical performance. The music, very much like everything else, was very generic and basic. Not bad but nothing out of the ordinary. 
The art though is very consistent but was in my opinion, very boring to look at. Very few shots with extraordinary art (If any?) and it all looked a bit childish at times so I found it hard to take some scenes seriously but that could've been that it was just me being not very fond of the art style. But as I said, no weird frames and everything looked like it was supposed to, I guess. 
So was this season worth it? Yes, if you managed to get through the first one this one is way better but still not very top notch. After reading all this I do realise it sounds like I didn't enjoy the show at all but I really did. Overall, it was good and I'd watch another season if there would come one but this isn't an anime you'd discuss for months with others.

    I give Owari No Seraph as a whole a total rating of 6/10 
Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-Hen or better Owari no Seraph: ""Battle of the Cliches"" is an anime literally about vampire's vs humans in this post-apocalyptic world where all adults above the age of 13 have died. This anime could have been something really special but it has so many flaws that I wouldn't recommend this anime. 
Let's start with the good points about this anime (so we can get them out of the way): 
- The art in the anime wasn't really bad. I liked it as it gave us this classical but a modern vibe which I was really impressed from. I liked how the settings were shown as well as how the art showed the characters. 
- The action scenes were good...well most of them. I really enjoyed when they had team fights and I was really impressed by the art that was done within these fights. 
Now, the bad points about this anime: 
- THE BIGGEST PROBLEM with this anime is character development. Literally, I feel like the makers of this anime hardly put any emotions or screen time from the secondary characters such as Kimizuki, Yoichi and Mitsu. Sure they got like an episode dedicated to them each, but after that we hardly EVER saw them, especially Mitsu. Now i'm not a die-hard Mitsu fan, but she hardly appeared when the characters had a dialogue to speak. All she was there for was the combat. I feel this should have been improved to get a better feeling of other characters, and to be much more immersive. Other loved characters such as Krul and Yu's demon hardly got screentime as well. 
- Another problem about the character development and some people may get mad at me for this is they put in some romance and then poof, it disappeared? I love romance, and when Guren asked Shinoa if she had feelings for Yu, after she said she didn't know IT JUST DISSAPEARED. Where did the slight chance of romance go? I'm not going to lie but I was hoping for a couple to develop and it looks like it never did. They tried to put in ""Romance"" but it didn't work. 
- Yu's and Mika's relationship was nothing more that fan service. It first started of as brotherly love and then turned into some gay ""I want you with me always"" relationship. I have nothing against gay people or gay animes but the way the creators produces these characters relationships was way over the top. Every ""love"" story has it's limits. 
- The story was full of cliches. The story wasn't really original, its pretty much like every other action anime out there. Do this, do that, save the world blah blah blah nothing unique in this anime. I didn't hate the story myself, it just could have been developed into something better. 
- The Crowly fights were always boring in my opinion. Everytime they gained ""power"" they always got stopped on, and it became really repetitive and got boring. The ending wasn't really good either as the epic fight lasted only a total of 20 seconds. 
- The soundtrack wasn't really amazing either. It didn't really pump me up or made me feel sad. Neither was it immersive. 
Overall I did like this anime but it needs ALOT of improving. Especially on the characters. 
Rating: 
Sound - 6 
Character - 6 
Enjoyment - 6 
Overall - 6.4 
TL;DR - Watch this anime if you're up for a story you probably have seen before with some differences.

    This is my first review for an anime, so excuse me if I gloss over anything important. (No Spoilers Below) 
To start, I will say that this anime is very ""safe"". If you enjoyed the first season of Owari no Seraph, then I would say that 9/10 of those people will enjoy season 2.  
When I say Owari no Seraph plays it safe, I mean that it doesn't really try to do anything new, or adventurous. Honestly, it reads like the Shonen TV Tropes Entry.  
Primarily a Fighting Series? - Check 
Backseat Romance Plot? - Check 
Teen Male Protagonist? - Check 
Now, the reason I give this anime a 5 is not because it's bad. In fact, I enjoyed Owari. That doesn't change the fact that Owari is a middle of the pack anime. It doesn't do anything bad, but doesn't do anythng great either. You won't be debating plot lines with your friends, and proabably won't be purchasing any merchandise but at least you can say ""Oh ya, I saw that show. It's alright."" 
If you're into action anime, I can recommend Owari. You could do a helluva lot worse. If you're into drama/plot driven anime, I strongly recommend you look elsewhere.

    This anime 
Characters (1/10): OMG! Has there ever been a group of characters more clique than these guys, the MC is a pain up the backside. He is so selfish, inconsiderate and impulsive its mind-numbing. A complete waste of space who you don't care about and don't want to route for the need to focus attention on him often means not being able to spend time on the other interesting elements in the story. While said elements are underdeveloped, part of the reason for this could well be the refusal of the series to allow us to leave the MC for an extended period of time to catch up with other characters in a meaningful way.  
Shinoa, AHHHH! She held so much promise in the first season, she was spunky, sarcastic, I liked her purple hair. This season she becomes a complete damsel in distress. I swear she did not use her weapon more than once this entire season. Every time she is about to defend herself the MC swoops in and saves her, HOW IS THAT FUCKING POSSIBLE? She has been in the Demon Army WAY LONGER THAN HIM, and yet she is completely incapable of defending herself! The other blonde chick whose name I can't remember is just useless and another girl whose crazy for the MC.  
Shihō Kimizuki's personality while somewhat different is still to close to that of the main character's to warrant him a place in this anime. We already have one hot headed guy with a sibling who they deeply care but are separated from, we don't need another. If giving them similar backstories was used to get them to relate to one and other and stop fighting it has been done in such an lame way that its not even worth giving credit to. 
Not talking about the brown haired dude, he does nothing as is of no importance, end of discussion. 
The other two squads are boring as hell, I have no idea who they are and what their purpose is so I can't even really tell you about them or evaluate them. 
Mikaela Hyakuya: The issue with this character is that he was created in relation to the personality of the MC and hence does not have any uniqueness to his character. All the traits which the MC has this guy, his adopted brother of sorts does not have. This obsession on the part of the creators for the two to be polar opposites at all times greatly limits the scope for character development. Its just a theory but one reason the MC never becomes as mature and logical as we would like him to be is because Mikaela in the creators eye's already fulfils this role and hence to have the MC gain such attributes to such an extent that no longer depends on Mikaela as much as he does would bring down the story. This of course is a load of bullshit. Negative and emotionless Mikaela is just annoying and someone who like the MC in fact does not want to seem to see what is right in front of him and face it head on. In fact he would much rather run away which he mentions multiple times to the MC. The situation however is that the conflict which they are both engulfed in makes this impossible. Also when your at war and you want to save those who love, man up, drink the blood and go full vampire!  
Fetid Bathory: A character who I feel has potential but this is not reached through the duration of the show. In my opinion he goes from being an arsehole who is just messing around to someone who does in fact have a multi-layered plan to achieve his aims. As we have no idea as to his motivations however and we don't get to see him concocting his schemes this part of the narrative is not as engaging as it should be. I will however say that his walk is ON POINT. If he never gets kicked out of the army he needs to get himself on the catwalks of Paris. If you where heels or want to, get a notepad and learn something from this guy. 
Guren Ichinose: Positive first shall we? I love his demon mode. Over the past two seasons this is a man who its clear is holding back when it comes to facing his enemies. To see him at full strength and let go of his inhibitions was great to see. Also unlike the Seraph transformation I am glad that his human and demon selfs look pretty much exactly the same excluding the eyes. I think a monster who looks like a man is always more frighting than whatever the seraphs are meant to be. Like all the cast he suffers from lack of character development. Out of all the characters however he is the most well rounded I feel and if it were up to me I would much rather have had this story  be told from his perspective rather than the MC's. 
FINAL POINT. WHY IS ANYONE IN THIS ANIME EVEN FIGHTING? On both sides no one really seems to care if there side wins (they don't act in a way that would help anyway) and if they do they way in which they go about it is sneaky and downright inhumane so you can't even admire them for it. Everyone in this anime seems to be focused on something other than ensuring victory for their cause. By the end of the season most of the characters who did once care about beating the other side to a pulp (MC etc) no longer put that at the top of their priorities. Those who are still actively fighting for one side doing it because they have an ulterior motive, because their power hungry or because they have nothing better to do and warfare is all they know even if they can't stand it. As you can imagine because they don't care you don't care and the stakes feel non-existent. When your watching an anime about a war in a post apocalyptic world with two sides fighting for survival and you don't care who wins, you know there's a problem. 
Art: The art is solid in this anime however there are a few things in the character design I take issue with. First why do all the buildings look the same? I admit I have never been to Japan but the characters do cover significant ground in this season hence I don't understand how one part of the city can look the exact same as another. 
Story: WTF happened this season? This story was messy and all over the place, to be honset I cannot even tell you what happened. The pacing was so poor I skipped masses of minutes in episodes, and yes I can tell review this anime having done that because even if you don't watch about 2/3 of this anime the story STAYS THE SAME. Tons of filler with people standing around talking, often in the middle of battle. I often forgot there was even a war going on. Furthermore while this season was based around a campaign that was sold as having significance to the war against vampires overall this ramifications of Demon's Army's Plan was not made apparent until the very last episode. There was no buildup whatsoever, the preceding episodes were completely devoid of tension.  
Enjoyment: I hated this anime. I don't even know why I watched it, the first season made it appear as if this anime was going somewhere interesting and then this season just let me down completely. You will stare at your computer screen asking WTF AM I WATCHING THIS?! If your like me and have only been fully committed to anime for the last few years (3 for me) and still have alto of classics to get through like I do then don't watch this, there are way better this both old and recent than this. Heck if your a sane human being don't watch this! Its not anime but if I wanna see the two brothers, one crazy, overpowered and reckless as fuck and the other tormented, classy and controlled go through thick and thin I'll watch The Originals.  
Final Score: (2/10) 
P.S: I did not go into all the areas of this anime because its so bad and the more I write the more I relieve it. I hope I gave you enough reasons TO NEVER WATCH THIS ANIME! Also I gave this anime a 4 which I now note is to high and will be changing ASAP.

    Story: 
From the storyline/plot, this anime is confusing much. It's easy to follow the story, but there are too many 'suddenly'. Suddenly he becomes that or suddenly that appears, suddenly this appears, suddenly this happen, suddenly this person was mentioned whom I never saw for the entire anime. 
Everything is lack of explanation and motivations/reasons as to why all of those happens? Who are actually the good guys? Who is siding with whom? Why is this guys like this? What and why are the reasons? It's all confusing. 
I detest reading and giving spoiler, however I'll mention this: probably you might have read a summary of this anime somewhere out there, mentioning that this anime has two groups: humans and vampires. One group are the antagonists and another is the protagonist. But, by the end of the day, you'll be wondering how many groups are actually there. 
It was like there is an X and Y, but at the end it appears that X wanted to destroy Y, and Y wanted to destroy X, but then X got A who is making C, and there is B who is looking for E, and A wants to be friend with Y but destroy E (this is only an example, no relation whatsoever with the anime), 
and everything happens without you knowing the reasons behind the action, not even until you finish the show. 
But no worries, you can still follow the story somehow, idek, it's just since the past stories are vague, and so are the present. 
It's okay, but when the characters are not in close-up, they are becoming weird somehow. Idk. 
Sawano Hiroyuki? I bet most people are interested with this anime because of him, but the soundtracks are a nope for me... other anime soundtracks on its season definitely better. 
For the main and most of the supporting characters, you could see their character development, especially if you compare it from the previous season. 
Although, there are several characters that are suddenly appear out of nowhere, or character who you can count how many times they appear suddenly have important roles out of the blue: without mentioning how and when and why. 
Each and every characters past and motivations are also vague. 
I'm a whole for man - man main characters with less girls on the screen, so this anime is good for me despite the whole mess and confusing characterisations and plot. This anime happen for pleasing all fujoshi out there I believe, including me.  
So, I 'm honestly found an enjoyment watching this especially for cliffhanger on several last episodes. 
If you don't have anymore anime to be watched or just deathly boring, you could try this anime.. 
My suggestion is just: don't think or you'll get totally confused, just enjoy the show and nods at everything they throw you. 
Honestly, the first season of this anime is not my cup of tea, and the second season is still not my cup of tea either. This anime isn't so bad that I have to put it in my black list.

    While Owari no Seraph is described as generic, typical shounen etc. I think once you look deeper into the story, it goes farther than generic. While it does have the typical themes of family, betrayal, powerful underdog characters, it does have a deeper meaning to it (in my opinion) Ill get to the review. 
Story- 8.5 
Bad- both seasons had the constant theme of ""family"" being shoved down your throat, and also had some faults in the animation and kind of typical shounen themes 
Good- However, there is more to this than the ""typical shounen"", while i understand that many haven't read the Guren Ichinose light novels/the manga, the second season clarifies a lot of questions from the first season while leaving them open ended (with multiple answers). Like who to trust, what is their real reason (these weren't truly answered, they are just open ended questions), background stories etc. This season also gives us a layer of depth by introducing the Hiragiis and the vampire progenitor council. While some would brush this series plot as typical shounen, the story isn't to be taken lightly. If you pay more attention the story then you can spot deeper plot points that are crucial to it.   
Art- 8.5 
The animation was average, but way better than the first season. I also enjoyed the backgrounds, and the animation style. With a slightly higher budget, Wit Studio touched up on the action scenes and other character movements (S1 Ep 3-6 had kind of sketchy character movements).  
Sound- 10 
I LOVE the soundtrack. The soundtrack would be played at the right moments and draw you more into the story. The music was really epic, I can't exactly put it into words how amazing the soundtrack was. 
Voice acting- I watched the dub, and needless to say, it was pretty good. I felt like all of the voices fit perfectly, exception being Yoichi, he sounded kind of weird when he screamed/yelled. Guren, Yu, Mika, and Shinoa sounded really good. Mika was amazing.  
Character- 9.5 
While many would say that the characters are stereotypical/ didn't get enough characterizations. I agree that a few characters are stereotypical but I feel like that they have mostly good characterizations. Many of the characters had enough backgrounds to support the reasons behind the way they act. However, the characters that I feel like who didn't get enough backup on their backstories were, Shinoa, Guren, Mito, basically Guren's squad, Narumi's squad, Kureto, Aoi, and Mika.  
Since I've read the Guren Ichinose light novels, most of their character felt complete to me while I was watching the anime. However, I feel that they should've put some factors on how Mika was abused by his parents and more of what led him to dislike humans. But some of these have been answered like (spoiler from 1st season) how Yu   
went berserk, (Guren Ichinose light novel spoiler) human experimentation by the Hyakuya sect, his hatred for the species  that murdered his family. Like I said, many questions have been answered in the second season but are still left open ended. 
I absolutely love this series, while there are some plotholes, these are all answered in the manga and the Guren Ichinose light novels. Also if you're new to anime, this has plenty of aspects similar to the Maze Runner series, some Percy Jackson, Harry Potter (Guren Ichinose light novels), and Attack on Titan. 
Overall- 9.99 
This series is amazing in my eyes, once you get past the stereotypes, it gets really good.

    Despite giving this anime decent scores across the board, I would recommend against watching it. 
Why? Because simply put, it ends in a cliffhanger and it seems unlikely it will ever be resolved.  
And even if it were, I don't see how any follow-up season can make up for the ridiculous lack of information in the first 2 seasons. 
This anime has one major problem, it was present in season 1 and is even more notable in season 2. Namely - it doesn't explain shit. Like seriously, there is no explanations for half the stuff that happens. You're left wondering what's going on, as the show puts in zero effort to tell you why anything is happening. There aren't any hints either. 
And it's not like it's some mystery the main characters discover as the story moves forward. No. It's clear that a lot of the characters in the show have a decent idea of what's going on at all times, they just have no intention of sharing it with the viewer. 
The most absurd events happen without the characters as much as blinking an eye at them, like it's all common knowledge, even though no line of reasoning could possibly explain what's happening on screen.  
Bloody demon gods and angels and world ending events start happening and the characters are like: ""oh yeah, this makes sense, that makes sense"". 
This whole season feels like 50 episodes of story and exposition was crunched into 12 episodes that also needed to feature a ton of action.  
Watch this show if you only care about mindless action scenes and some decent character interactions without understanding a damn thing about what's going on in the world. 
--- 
Spoiler examples: 
The premise of the whole show is simple enough - vampires are real and after a big plague on humanity they took over a notable part of the world etc etc etc. 
Already things are going off the rails because origin of vampires is never explained. Everyone just accepts their existence without question. Like ""oh yeah, they always existed for sure, right?"". Like seriously, at least give us 5 minutes of exposition saying they've been a myth that became real or something. Anything. 
Then suddenly, without the show explaining anything, characters are suddenly aware that Demons also exist, and for some reason inhabit weapons that humans wield against the vampires. 
No explanation is ever given as to why Demons are a thing and how humans figured them out.  
Then there's some sort of magic also. Spells and curses. But again, zero explanation how it all came to be and why people are aware of them. Apparently shit just exists with half the characters treating it all like common knowledge you learn in kindergarten, while the other half has zero clue. Like which is it? Is magic and monsters and demons common knowledge or not? 
Like seriously, this show is like Attack on Titan without any character in the show ever asking what Titans are or where they come from or anything like that. Imagine Attack on Titan where the entire show is as it is with literally every exposition scene cut out. Because that's what Seraph of the End is. If actually feels like characters have 10 hours deep talks about the nature and history of the world, but it's all cut out in the anime because the studio couldn't be bothered to make more episodes. 
It's frustrating.

    This season doesn't even come close in terms of overall enjoyment to the first season.  The storyline was chaotic and disorganized, it seemed to jump back and forth throughout the season - never settling down.  The plot wasn't complex - it just didn't follow logic nor did it make much sense.  I guess you could call it unique but not necessarily in a positive way. 
The art was consistent with the kind found in the first season - industry standard and well-made, though nothing special.  The backgrounds fit in well, accentuating rather than deterring from the scenes they were home to.  The character designs were unique and none of the characters looked similar to one another.  The artists didn't skimp out on this one - they made every character look distinct. 
The characters were even less well-rounded than in the first season.  My review of the first season highlighted the lack of depth in the characters shown.  This season is an even worse offender in this regard.  The entire show surrounds a war between humans and vampires and doesn't stop to consider the feelings of the characters mindlessly taking part in the bloodshed.  That being said, the main antagonists turned out to be a surprise and not whom the viewer would expect to be villains. 
I didn't find much joy watching this season of Owari no Seraph.  However, it was necessary to complete the show and absorb as much of the storyline as possible.  If you're a fan of constant exaggerated anime-style warfare, you'll likely relate to this season.  I won't be rewatching Owari no Seraph unless the next season is released.  The show ends on a terrible cliffhanger/plot twist and leaves the viewer feeling lost in the dark.  Owari No Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen is not ""awful"" but there are certainly other anime out there more worthy of your time.

    Firts, this is not the best anime like the most of the shonen's. It has a different story than another storys of vampires and inusual condiments. You can follow an apocalypsis with vamppires and humans into war and even demoniac possesions  with drama and touches of comedy.  
The good thing here is that you can enjoy the plot and the story line pace even if you don't capture the meaning of each stuff from the manga, by the way, there are some changes from the manga in the animation. I guess all this was because of the fan-service, in fact , I believe that the relationship between the two principal characteres is ""canon"" even so, they don't showed that there is here anything more than an closely ""friendship"" or ""family relationship""- Actually, that was one of the problems in the construction of the principal characters in my opinion and all the main story. There is a kind of complex , better to say, there is  an obssesion around the necessity of mantein and protect the link with the family or the people that they considerer important.  
At least I enjoyed the two seasons and it wasnt hard ended them fastly, thats one of the reasons because I recomend this anime, just give it a try.

    Better than the first season, but still lacking. 
At least this time around they're actually doing something.  This might be a relatively short review, but here goes: 
Overall, I gave it a 6/10: Fair.  There were a few factors that worked really well in the series but it was held back by the two most important ones: Story and Characters.  We might as well talk about those first. 
Characters: 5/10 
Oh man are they all over the place. 
LtCol Guren does redeem himself a bit in this season.  He comes off a bit more as a competent commander of a special unit, whereas there were just some actions in the first season that made him look like a joke.  That's something I just cannot get over.  One moment he's serious, and the next he's extremely immature.  It seems like the writers could not grasp a hold of the actual character.  Furthermore, they could have really done more to explain his relationship with his demon weapon.  You'll have to see it to know what I mean, but they barely covered it, leaving no effect on the audience whatsoever. 
Yoichi: Classic goodie-two-shoes. God I hate these worthless people.  Yoichi, during the series is portrayed as a competent squad member with high talent.  Okay, he does do a few things in combat that makes him not completely suck, but he's such a bland character that lacks strength and doesn't really have an emphasized level of intelligence either.  His only redeeming quality is that he is a supportive, good person. Bleh. 
Shinoa: I did like her since the first season.  She's witty and antagonizing towards the main characters.  She's usually a decent Squad Leader, yet this season, and bits of the first one, she had a few lapses.  I guess they're still kids afterall.  Perhaps it's good writing to have the viewer both like and dislike the character in some ways, or maybe its that they can't decide on one personality for them. 
The other squad members: Barely existed this season. Definitely true for Mitsuba, and I can't really think of much to write about Kimizuki. Enough said. 
Mika: Not too much to judge wrong with this character, though later on in the series, you run into a very BL interaction moment.  As we recall, Mika hates humans and hates vampires.  He hates everybody and is very conflicted.  You don't really get an idea of what he wants, other than the obvious, saving Yu. And even then, you don't really get an idea of how. 
Krul:  Alright, I must admit, I'm tired of the common vampires, zombies, werewolves, etc that are just flooding the fiction/fantasy world.  Krul is probably among 2 vampires that I actually like/pay any attention to.  (The other, of course is everyone's favorite little donut eating blonde).  There is definitely something intriguing about Krul's body language, her tone of voice and her special treatment of Mika. Plus, she's pretty hot, and not just because she's 2D.  She's confident, (obviously because she's the vampire queen), and you don't want to piss her off.  Ah, finally, another decent vampire character. 
Hiiragi Shinya: He was also a pretty decent character. Skilled, cocky with a chip in his shoulder, at first you think he's extremely shady, but redeems himself immensely as the story goes on.  Not a bad dude. 
Also, there's quite a few minor characters that were present for an episode or two here and there.  Some I liked, some I didn't, and others I thought were used the wrong way in the story. 
But, one of the ones I hated most of all: 
Yuuichirou. 
MAIN CHARACTER SYNDROME.  His wiki entry should read, ""blah blah generic adolescent main character with typical main character haircut who is hot headed and wants revenge.  Between the first season and this one, he has rediscovered his idea of family, the people he wants to protect?  Is that really the only development he has? Really, that's it? ARGH! that's so overdone!  Also, he's a complete idiot.  You see him do things that completely endanger himself, the squad and the rest of the unit.  He just doesn't drop it.  Yuuichirou sucks. 
Story: 5/10 
So while the first season pretty much was just an establishment, in this season the humans and vampires actually go into organized combat... For one battle anyway. Yes, the entire season pretty much focuses on the events of ONE battle.  Alright, that might not always be terrible, as there were some pretty good war movies out there about singular engagements.  But at least you get to finish those in one 2-hour sitting.  Not that I don't like battle scenes, but in an entire season, they could have honestly inserted more content. 
Otherwise, the story was completely disjointed. Alright, so what developments occurred to influence the actions of Krul Tepes and Guren Ichinose?  Where did ""Owari no Seraph"" come from?  Why did it turn out to be (spoilers)?  Since when were the Hiiragi brass planning to enact their master plan?  None of this was covered in any detail or explained properly. 
Also, not enough death occurred. 
Now onto the two factors that worked in favor of a good rating for Owari no Seraph: Art & Sound. 
Art: 7/10 
It's 2016. Good art in this day and age shouldn't be an astounding accomplishment.  Flashy effects, decent drawing and animation, plus one detailed scene of Shinoa that made me bite my lip.  Otherwise, they didn't try anything really new or groundbreaking. 
Sound: Again, 7/10 
They did actually put together a good soundtrack.  In particular, the ED and some of the OSTs. You have to pay attention during a lot of the combat scenes to realize how well the OSTs are used. 
Finally, enjoyment and overall score: 
Despite the most crucial elements of the series falling very short (scattered story and mediocre characters), there's something that kept me watching. Maybe it was the industry standard placement of a cliffhanger at the end of every.single.episode, or the constant action.  Yeah, they didn't do too bad there.  I mean, if the show were not at least decent, or even good, I would not have been able to binge it over the course of one night and the following morning. 
I give enjoyment and the series an overall score of 6/10.  The first season was much worse, trust me.  If you've seen that, I suppose you might as well watch this season to make up for it.

    SPOILERS! Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers! Do not go ahead unless you don't care about the plot, which you shouldn't anyway because it's predictable as hell. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
And here's the second season of the uninspiring, cliche spewing show of Owari no Seraph.  
To begin, I don't remember too much of the first season because it was unimpactful, however I do believe that it was at the very least, more enjoyable than this season. 
Let's start with the OP. Why the hell was that song chosen for this series? It sounds like something for the Toaru no series, not this. Season 1 had a phenomenal OP and ED. However, this season's OP is absolutely terrible both song-wise and its sequence. The sequence is basically just a bunch of people making poses for the camera... that's it. Now the ED is better than the OP, but still nothing like season 1's ED which had a great song as well as a breathtaking and even mind provoking sequence (if you really want to think that hard). This season's ED just looks like something for a drama/romance series. It has very little relevance to the theme of the show.  
Now the story for the second season is basically summarised in the title, ""Battle in Nagoya"". But before we get to that part there's a few episodes expanding on the situation and what not.  
So firstly we're introduced to some kind of political infighting/stand off which results in Kimizuki and Yoichi getting tortured. But... they don't seem to mind (the entire party) because it seems to be something that should just occur naturally (wut). Kimizuki has a very good reason for accepting it (sister), but everyone else seems to accept it without too much issue. And I'll also mention that this event has no impact later whatsoever (or rather thus far). 
The second event was 'demonic manifestation'. And how they overcome it, is basically the same as when they first got their weapons, just cos'. Demon makes illusion. User realises it's an illusion because the damn illusion itself is so unrealistic and out of whack within the story itself that even a five year old could probably distinguish it. And demon is overcomed... wow, such struggle... 
For the main plot line it's basically just a bunch of fights with trash mobs (unimportant characters) dying off, probably to show 'maturity' (lol). And as for the fights themselves, they're very dull, boring and slow, making it feel worse than season 1. To describe it I will simply put it into three cases. The first is the faceless or generic faced vampires who basically get killed by a single offhanded practice swing, the second is the 'boss' fight which takes a little longer and results in either humans or vampires dying (depending which side's main character is present), and the last is background fighting where trash mobs swing at each other indefinitely or one of them gets on RNGesus's bad side and dies. 
As for the conversations here's how it mainly goes between Yu and anyone else he talks to, basically: 
Other person makes a realistic statement/evaluation about current situation which would be an logical remark at the time. 
Yu complains and pulls out one of three responses: 
1. Nakama (friends) 
2. Kazoku (family) 
3. Revenge against vampires 
Afterwards the other person will look at Yu with shock and awe and realise how silly their original realistic remark was and immediately agree with Yu and forget that they even had an original thought in the first place.  
So overall, if you liked season 1 would you like season 2? Maybe, but it does feel worse. If you didn't like season 1 would you like season 2? Definitely not, and you should probably go watch something else, like One Punch Man.

    From the standpoint of someone who watched this just to kill time during the daily commute: 
Normally any such anime I watch just needs to have decent art/animation and explosions or similar to satisfy me. No character development or great story is expected. The first season fit this criteria, so I would have been fine with more of the same in the second. 
The art and animation was fine, the fighting was fine, not too much drawn-out downtime nonsense, it should have had all the makings of a nice mediocre subway watch. But read on... 
Now, anytime I watch shounen stuff I mentally steel myself for the ridiculous convictions the main characters tend to hold and spew forth at any given opportunity. But when it comes to Yu and his 'family', and their motivations and actions when it comes to 'family', I couldn't handle it. It got so much worse this second season. It's immature of me to be emotionally affected by an anime like this one but I will admit I got a little upset. The sheer stupidity and hypocrisy hit me like a sledgehammer. This is of course far from the only anime that contains this sort of thing but I simply cannot fathom why this IP is so popular given the above. I sure hope nobody thinks that his way of thinking is honorable or admirable. I was able to finish the season only because I held on to the improbable belief that all the main characters would die horribly as divine retribution. 
tl;dr It was mediocre, but my personal sensitivity to the extreme nonsense that counts as the main character's reason for existence made it next to unwatchable. I finished it half because I am a glutton for punishment and half because it was just a timekiller on the commute anyway.

    Okay, so... not the killer sequel series I was hoping for. Just so y'all know before you watch this, the season does end as though it's going to have a third season when, in fact, it doesn't. So, that's a bit annoying. 
Starting off with the art. I'm still in love with it. The character designs are done so well, the effects are awesome, and the landscapes look great. The sound, again, wasn't up my alley when it came to the OP and ED songs. The background music, though, was bomb. Anytime something epic was supposed to happen, a track would kick in that would just make the scene 100xs better. 
The characters... Listen. Every character is very interesting to me. Their relationships with each other, especially, were written very nicely. It made for some heartwarming scenes that I enjoyed a lot. That being said... I was hoping for more. I wanted to know more about the characters themselves, and this season didn't really deliver. It eluded to a lot of things in the pasts of some of these characters, but it was never looked into and explored. There could've been extremely interesting stories to tell through the characters' pasts and what their pasts had to do with the current plot.  
I found that problem with the story as well. For starters, the idea of this season simply being a battle was a bit off-center. I was hoping that the sequel would delve into some of the unanswered questions left by the first season like the human experimentation, the end of the world, the rise of vampires, etc. However, none of it was covered or explained. This season showed a lot of stuff happening that was supposedly meant as an answer for the questions we had, but it just came off as confusing because there was no context for what or why something was happening. More than likely, a lot of that fault lies with the fact that this season told its story assuming it had more time to tell it with another season, so the story ended up being told halfway. I know there's more in the manga, but to watch this season as it was just felt strange.  
I still very much enjoyed watching it, though. I'm still invested in what's going on and how this world works because it interests me a lot. Seeing these characters interact with each other, and seeing how deep some of their bonds run was really lovely. I just wish there would've been more of it. It also would've been cool to see the characters train and develop their skills because the fighting sequences were dope. There's a lot I love about the Owari no Seraph series, I just think it goes by way too quickly. Without being nitpick-y, I'm glad I watched this series. Hopefully I'll find more like it in the future.

    The second season of Owari no seraph was far from bad, however in my opinion it lost its edge. The first installment was dark and gloomy and showed us the pain that Yuu goes through after loosing his family. You can also see the struggle humanity has to face against the vampires, although the vampires are still immensely powerful in the second season it looses its dark touch on my option becoming more of a generic shounen anime. Never the less i enjoyed it due to it being Owari No Seraph related. 
The main cast return once more so there's nothing much to say on that end, however the relationships between them grow much more as they fight together. This on my opinion is a nice touch to the series. 
In a whole give it a watch if you're a big fan of the series, otherwise i doubt you will enjoy it as much

    this is my first time giving a review, this anime was my first vampire anime after this anime i have became addicted to them, the story is great with a lots of actions and fantasy. the anime is perfect but the ending was not complete the way this season ends is just not satisfying, this makes a hope for season 3 without season 3 this anime seems incomplete. but other then that the anime is really amazing and worth a watch. 
this anime was my second anime that i watched and enjoyed, the story is perfect i cant believe i watched the whole story 4-5 times it was really enjoyable

    OVERALL- if you liked the first season you should watch this. 100% should. 
Listen.. I really tried to give it a high score, because I really enjoyed it. Lots of things I didn't like, but still it was a good show. 
Good things: 
1. The fighting: THE FIGHTING SCENES ARE AMAZING 
2. Character design and some character's secrets or development- the designs are probably my favorite part. also some characters are developed amazingly(while others are just left where they started)  
Bad things: 
1. plot pacing- the plot pacing is not the same for all the episodes. There are episodes I really enjoyed and there are... well some that were so long and made me want to  stop watching.  
2. the plan is not clear- so, in the series they have some kind of plan. ""what kind of plan?"", you may rightfully ask, well I WATCHED THE WHOLE THING AND HAVE NO IDEA. 
3. the yu X mika ship- now, I don't have a problem with this ship or anything, but half the series focuses on this stupid romance thing and not on  the fucking plot. also the motivations for the characters are not clear at all. 
4. inconsistencies- for example: kimizuki worries about mirai because [INSERT SPOILER HERE], but a second later is like ""nah i'll leave my sister to die nvm"" 
yu's behavior when trying to save guren- when it's convenient for the plot he just forgets it. 
5. protagonist syndrome- basically, yuu and mika can't die and yuu can become a demon- salt king- whatever thing hybrid and still survive and not kill any major character 
6. plot convenience: some things just happen because yuu or plot. not really a solid reason.  
I don't think I can count it as a point, but anytime yuu would burst through a wall or enter a battle in the middle I would just start laughing out loud. 
Still, I thinks this anime is great.

    Owari no Seraph is a lot like Attack on Titan. Almost to the point that it feels like the show was trying to be Attack on Titan, and perhaps this was what the producers were going for (Though you can't blame the original author who started the series before Titan hit mass popularity). That is; Owari no Seraph a messy anime that's chaotic, a plot that zips around like a cat on meth, leaves a lot of questions unanswered, has too many characters trying to be developed that it leaves all the characters only half-developed, and too many shounen tropes being blown out of proportion. But it manages to be successful and has a decent fanbase (At least in Japan) by playing on over-the-top edgy themes of humanity survival against monsters, stylish looking characters butting heads with one another, and political machinations being put everywhere. 
It's a huge convoluted mess. Humans fighting for survival against vampires who want to use them as livestock, people making pacts with demons to gain power, rampaging monsters called Horsemen of the Apocalypse who slaughter things for unexplained reasons, mass genetic experimentation, biblical terms being thrown everywhere, angels descending down to punish everyone, and throughout it all everyone betraying one another to pursue their own agenda. All of this in one huge ball of mess and even after 24 episodes nothing is really answered or explained. The closing episode in fact can be described as an incoherent stack of legos a kid decided to make and chuck across the room where all the characters and plot crashes in a heaping mess.  
Despite this Owari no Seraph can be a decent show to watch if you don't take it seriously. If you're the type of person who needs things explained and you take anime seriously, you will hate this show. But for someone who wants to watch a Saturday cartoon on a boring weekend with ""cool"" and ""stylish"" characters shouting bombastic lines and trying to kill each other in a shounen mess, then Owari no Seraph is entertaining and even fun. It has decent animation and fights, there's quite a few clever jokes that can be funny, and a lot of the characters are likable even if they come off half-baked. You can't deny that the character designs are eye-catching, like the Demon Army in their imperial military uniform and pretty looking vampires in cape coats. It has orchestral music to go along with its edgy themes of apocalyptic world end.  
Serpah of the End is Attack on Titan that didn't hit massive popularity in the west. If it had the budget that Attack on Titan held and had a stronger beginning rather a slow and dull one it probably could have become the next big hit. Objectively though, Owari no Seraph is average and has a lot of problems trying to stay organized. It's a show you watch if you're bored and if you like themes of world end, humanity's survival, and fantasy shounen.

    I just finished watching all of Owari no Seraph, and after taking some time to think it over, this is how I rated it. 
The story gets a very solid six.  I find the set up fairly interesting, especially since I don't really care for vampires in general.  I really wanted to rate it a seven, but there were so many parts left unexplained, which will probably be shown in the third season... if it ever gets there. 
The art was outstanding to me, and it's what I expected from Wit Studio.  Definitely, check out the Blu-Ray if you can.  The animation while airing on tv has some bad quality, but it's still pretty great. 
Although I thought the soundtrack was fair, I really did enjoy the English tracks on it.  I also love the first season's opening the most.  The song for the second season's ending was beautiful, even though I couldn't watch the ending since I just wanted to skip to the next episode. 
The major downfall of this show are the characters themselves, especially Yuu.  He is insufferable.  It's almost like the mangaka was trying to create the most annoying character, and combined every protagonist in Shonen Jump - and Kirito from SAO.  I really liked Shinoa, but the second season.  Jesus Christ.  Why would you not follow orders from your superiors when you're in a vampire apocalypse and everyone's lives are at stake?  The entire squad bothered me to no end. 
Props to Mikaela for being the best damn character in the show, though. 
Overall, I really did enjoy the show.  I ended up binge-watching season two as soon as I finished season one on blu-ray.  It is a mediocre show, yes.  But I definitely think it's a good time waster.  If a third season does come out, I will be watching it, even if it is just for Mikaela alone.

    I enjoyed the first season of owari no seraph because I mostly only cared about the two main characters (mostly mika)'s storyline between the two of them. So I gave the second season a watch of course~ 
This season wasn't what I expected... But that's not necessarily a good thing. Slow when it shouldn't be, and too fast when it ought to be more deliberate! Barely any progression for one minute and changing courses the next!  
The same as the first season, very pretty but nothing too striking 
The music is appropriate for the scenarios, and the sound effects are on point and well edited 
Practically no development, and the only one who truly changes I don't think everyone particularly agreed with how they went about it... 
OK so it's pretty above average right? Yeah..the fighting sequences are cool and all at times. But the pacing made it more difficult than ever 
This show is a soap opera, if you like the characters interactions it can be fun to watch, but that's about it. I had high hopes for this show... I won't be looking forward to the next season but I can't help but watch it to see what happens next o.o   
Oh well, at least there's the manga (and countless doujinshis *wink)

    If we compare this season to the previous one, battle of Nagoya takes our breath considerably better. There are a lot of shocking and badass moments as well as crazy cliff hangers that drive you crazy and leave you just wanting to see more. I grew surprisingly attached to this series as it continued on along the season, but a matter that i couldn´t help but worry about was the plot.  
The premise of the series as a whole is very interesting and quite promising, which is why it is such a pity seeing all that potential being crushed by an open ending that leaves it filled with plot holes that were never covered. All that anticipation that this series succeded to build through those amazing cliff hangers and shocking moments was never satisfyed at the end, which is equivalent to the series bitch-slapping the viewers on the face.  
Sadly, if this doesn´t get a third season (which is most likely), the series wont be able to stand on itself as consistent story and would be just a bunch of cool scenes put together without any sense whatsoever because we didn´t get a full clear explanation of it all.

    We return to post-apocalyptic Japan, where years earlier, all humans over the age of 13 were killed due to a mysterious illness. Yuuichirou Hyakuya and the rest of the Shinoa squad are now full-fledged members of the Moon Demon Company, [supposedly] one of the most elite military groups in the Vampire Extermination Unit. This season focuses on the battles that take place in Nagoya, a territory that has been overrun by the vampires. 
Owari no Seraph first gained popularity as a less edgy version of the popular and wildly overrated anime Shingeki no Kyojin. Obviously the shows are very different, but the parallels certainly are there; some kind of supernatural threat (vampires, in this case) took over the world and wiped out a large portion of the human population. Humans survive by living inside a wall that said supernatural beings can't infiltrate. And our main character, like Eren Jaeger, is a hotheaded, ambitious teenage boy whose only goal is to defeat ALL the supernatural beings. 
Unfortunately, there is one more similarity worth mentioning. Like Shingeki no Kyojin, Owari no Seraph is vastly overrated. The pilot episode of season 1 tells a compelling story of a boy who was forced to sacrifice his family in order to live and then swore revenge. It draws viewers in and elicits sympathy for the main character. However, the story quickly devolves into a vampire remix of traditional cliche shounen anime, filled with cheap asspull powerups and nakama speeches. Season 2 continues the Owari no Seraph tradition, but with even worse execution. 
Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen has a few very large issues, but the biggest one in my opinion is with the plot. Even after 24 episodes, we the viewers have no idea what a seraph is, much less what a Seraph of the End is. We don't understand how demon possession works, or what the metaphysical foundation of the series is. It's never really clear what that big box in episode 11 is, nor do we ever learn what the mysterious trumpet is. Even the season finale introduces a lot of new concepts that we've never seen before. It has lots of completely new exposition, amounts SO copious it's alarming. We shouldn't be learning so much in a finale episode; we should be wrapping things up. 
(""King of Salt,"" really? That sounds like a snarky internet blogger.) 
As if this horrible plot and pacing weren't bad enough, the characters in Owari no Seraph are also dislikable. I had a hard time choosing which side I was cheering for, because I honestly didn't care for the humans or vampires. The only characters I moderately liked in season 1 were Ferid and Shinoa, yet both of them in season 2 lacked the quirkiness that made them so unique and lovable. The members of Shinoa's squad, which received considerable development in season 1, fade to the background in this new season, causing an unfortunate shift in focus towards Yuu and Mika. 
Yuu is an impulsive, naive brat who is far too confident in his abilities and thinks his belief in ""kazoku"" (family) can trump any and all evil. Mika is a severely one-sided character who has absolutely NO personality outside of caring for Yuu. Plus, he has serious communication issues. (Really now, how hard would it have been for him to EXPLAIN why the humans were dangerous?!) The two of them make such pathetic main characters that I'm starting to wonder if they only got the spotlight to pander to fujoshis. They are both such uninteresting, unremarkable characters that the only way they can keep the audience's interest is if the audience SHIPS THEM. 
One of the saving graces of Owari no Seraph season 1 was its music. The OP and ED were well received; however, season 2's themes don't really have the same impact. Again, the OP has a lot of yaoibait, most definitely so fujoshis on Tumblr would have something to rant about. The ED was nothing special either. And while Owari no Seraph's OST is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, season 2's soundtrack once again fails to stand out. Owari no Seraph has pretty good art, between the detailed character designs and controversial watercolor backgrounds. That said, season 2's art and animation suffered a noticeable decrease in quality at multiple times throughout the series. And with even the music and animation falling short, Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen doesn't have anything going for it, really. 
Overall, it doesn't take a genius to see that Owari no Seraph was overrated from the beginning. That said, I was willing to give it multiple chances, as I have a weakness for hot vampires and good art. Unfortunately, however, Nagoya Kessen-hen was the final nail in the coffin. Unless I have a sudden change of heart or a hell of a lot of free time, I will NOT be watching any sequels that follow. The plot has deteriorated to such a point that I do not know--or CARE--what is happening. The entire story is riddled with tired shounen tropes that should have died out a long time ago. The characters aren't particularly endearing (minus Tsukki 2.0 and maybe Ferid), the music isn't that great, and the animation is unspectacular. There's nothing keeping me watching, and I kind of wish I hadn't wasted time on this season. 
Final score: 3/10  
Do I recommend it? No.

    Owari no Seraph is the worst anime I have ever watched, after the mediocre season 1 ended it was hard to see whether the production company could do any worse. OMFG it got worse. The animation is poor at times. 
The sound sometimes seems out of sync. 
By episode 10 it is an utter snooze fest - plot lines are predictable, stupid at times because absolutely nothing made any sense. 
Characters are lifeless and wooden, they took Mika's character and shit on it. 
WTF, where did the King of Salt come from? Was to try and emulate my emotions while trying to force myself to watch this pile of shit? 
For something that was supposed to emulate AoT, it seems a crime to even compare the two. 
3/10 - I hope this burns in hell for all eternity!

    I just finished the last episode of season 2. 
The three last episodes were by far the best ones, but sadly, the ending was weak and I would've loved to see some more serious action. 
In other words, the battles were too short. 
The way the last episode ended was disappointing.  
We were in the middle of something and then, without knowing what happened to the characters, we were sent 4 months forward, and I think we missed a big part of the details from right after the battle. 
I'd like to watch a third season of this anime because I think that the way second season ended just didn't fill out the needs.  
Like knowing who survived and what happened to each character, how the injured managed to escape and such.  
Now, for the art, the characters were looking as lovely as ever, but they didn't fit in with the background art and I hope you will change that in the future if you will be making a next season.  
I don't recommend changing the characters art in order for them to fit into the background images, but instead, make the background images better to fit the character art. 
The sound was good, but the english voice actor for Mika doesn't fit with how serious the japanese voice actor did Mika.  
The japanese one made Mika sound way more serious, whereas the english makes Mika sound too soft. 
As for character 
They were beautiful and we got to see some more of one of the main character Mika's, thoughts and feelings, which is what I really wanted. 
Needed more action that gives us a need to continue watching. 
Overall, I enjoyed the anime. 
It's a nice anime that deserves a bit more work I believe, but I recommend it to anyone who's into a bit of war, military, fantasy, drama, (bro-mance ;])

    Owari no Seraph was a good anime. It's story was good and hooked me in with the first episode. By the end of season 1 I was completely confused as to whose side to be on. Both the Vampires and he Humans sucked. I finally watched season two and finished it to see if it cleared up my confusion and it did to some extent, but still I don't like either side.  
(Spoiler??) Another thing that just annoyed me the whole time watching it was that Yuu and Mika didn't even get together until the 10th episode of the second season! Like wtf?! (Not counting the very short reunion in season 1) The whole time I'm waiting for them to find each other and team up and it be all awesome but it didn't even happen. They barely fought together and it only lasted two episodes because the show ended shortly after the teamed up.  
Show ends unfinished tho which sucks but if you want to continue there is the manga so it's not so bad but I wouldn't mind a season 3 and if one came out I would definely watch it.

    -This is a review of both seasons of Owari no Seraph- 
The tenacity of the human race is a topic often tackled in all sorts of mediums, and generally, humans are shown to be these cockroach like creatures which survive can survive any sort of catastrophe. We have seen post-apocalyptic world before not just in anime with shows like Shinsekai Yori but also in other mediums and if the Fallout franchise’s popularity is any indication a lot of people, myself included, love post-apocalyptic settings for their fictional worlds. 
As part of the Monthly Anime Club’s “24+ episode” anime month I have been recommended the 2015 two cour anime Owari no Seraph; an anime which tries, like many works before it, to show us just how the human race would behave if it was driven into a corner by some threat. This time the threat is, of all things, vampires. 
Story and Characters 
In the world of Owari no Seraph vampires aren’t what you might be used to up until now; creatures which lurk in the shadows, fearing the sun and anything holy who only come out at night to feed on human blood. No, in Owari no Seraph our vampires got major buffs in that they are now immune to anything but special cursed weapons plus the really strong ones are one man armies who can destroy buildings in one sword swing. They still need to drink blood however and do have that weakness against those pesky cursed weapons. 
Our main character, Yuuichiro Hyakuya, is an orphan who has been captured by the vampires at a young age along with the other children from the orphanage, the most important of which is Mikaela Hyakuya, but we’ll get to him later. 
This show still being very much a show aimed at young boys has our main character portrayed as a friend-loving dumbass has is a special snowflake that can even disobey military orders without being court-martialed. He is a shounen protagonist through and through and if you’ve seen Blue Exorcist, he is most similar to Rin from that show. 
Next up we have Yuu’s squad commander Shinoa Hiiragi. Shinoa is the only character who I think was in any way shape or form likeable, the others just left a lukewarm taste in my mouth. Shinoa is this show’s “tease” character, by that I mean she loves to poke fun at anything our protagonist does and generally lights up the mood with her jokes.  I don’t usually praise voice acting in Japanese dubs because, well, I don’t speak Japanese but this time I do have to give some props to Shinoa’s voice actor for really selling the character. 
Yuu’s squad consists of three more people, none of which get enough development and are just there because we need more archetypes.  
Firstly we have  Kimizuki who is this show’s rival character and resident four-eyed good-at-everything badass. His purpose in the show is to be that one character who always clashes with the main protagonist but not in a bad way, just in a friendly rivalry sort of way. All shounens need one of these.  
Second, we have our friendly neighbourhood wimp who fittingly enters the scene by getting bullied and “saved” by our main character. His purpose in the show is to always be better than the others when in comes to handling this shows “magic”, the demonic Infernal Arms. He also likes to cry a lot and hug people. 
And last but not least, we have our tsundere loli with an attitude problem. Oddly enough, the show seems to want to expand on her character more with a few scenes that at first seems to be building up into something bigger but nothing happens in the end. I guess they didn’t want her to get more time than main-girl Shinoa. 
It may seem like I am way too harsh and dismissive of these characters but there’s honestly not a lot to talk about with them. They all have a single motive, a single bad memory of the past that drives them to join the army and hunt vampires. 
While we are on the topic of vampires let’s talk about this shows Suzaku Kururugi; Mikaela Hyakuya. That one line should say most of what is to say about his character, he was once friends with the main character, now they are on different sides and they clash a few times. Though the relationship doesn’t end like Suzaku’s and Lelouch’s, with Mikaela and Yuu having strong feelings for each other, feelings strong enough to make any fujoshi get nosebleeds. 
The show also tries to whos both sides of the story as neutraly as it can but, oddly enough, it ends up portraying the vampires in a better light that the humans. It could also be that this was the intention since there is a lot of talk in the show about how bad and evil humans are and how good and pure vampires are. Even the clothing of the two parties shows hints of this with the vampires having pure white robes while the humans fight in black. Usually it would be the other way around. The humans are also not helped by the fact that their main weapons for fighting off vampires are contracts with demons which reside in powerful weapons. 
Since this show is a show about a war between two factions death should be inevitable, right? Not if you are part of the main gang. The main characters in this show must be wearing some extra strength plot armour because even though they, and when I say they I mostly mean Yuu, get situations which would kill other humans ten times over they get magically saved by something or other. This aspect of the show is especially aggravating since the main characters get constantly told that death is inevitable and that they should watch each other backs or otherwise they will get destroyed, but even when they make some huge mistake they aren’t punished for it in the slightest. 
Animation and Sound 
The animation in Owari no Seraph is actually really good with certain fight scenes being particularly well done, even if they cheat and use CG. Even so, the use of CG in the show is kept to a minimum and when it is used it is mostly unnoticeable. 
The personality of the show really comes from the colours chosen and the character designs. The colours for the characters uniforms and hair combining bright green with pastel colours and black and the predominantly grey and brown backgrounds manage to give this show a pretty unique look which not many shows manage to achieve. The design for character’s eyes, in particular, is also rather unique, if I had to compare it to some other show I’d say it’s a more polished version of Shiki’s eye design.  
While the show does stick out from the crowd in the art and animation department, in the sound department it’s not doing so hot. Out of all the openings and endings, only the last ending really stood out as something I might listen to without having the show as a support. Besides the endings and openings some of the shows songs combine orchestra music with synthetic beats which, in my opinion, is not a good combination. Though when the songs are good they can really add to the scene such as with the a song simply titled 108.  
Final thoughts 
Owari no Seraph is a show that I have been looking forward to watching but never really got around to. Now that I have seen it however, I am a little disappointed. The show could have done much more with its premise if only it had strayed away from a lot of the shounen tropes it is plagued by. It might be an enjoyable watch if you don’t mind special snowflake main characters and plot armour almost as thick as Kirito’s from SAO but for me this show only managed to keep me entertained enough to make me want to finish it. As much as I liked the animation and Shinoa this show is definitely not for me.

    Seraph of the End really did not get off on the right foot when it first arrived on the scene, did it? I mean when the premise of your show revolves around vampires ruling the world and massacring everyone you hold dear, the last thing you want to see in said world is a fucking high school. And yet somehow, that wasn't the worst problem to befall the series. Wit Studio has never been good at managing budget - which is fair considering they're still new and all - but even by their standards, Seraph of the End looked like complete ass. I'm not sure if it was fixed in the blu-ray, but the first cour was riddled with production problems that made the incredibly bland writing even blander, along with making Durarara!!x2 Shou look like it was animated by Madhouse on a good day. Awful character movement. Action scenes consisting of nothing but stills. Devoting entire episodes to generic ""friendship is everything"" bullshit. It'd be hilarious if it wasn't killing the show's pacing in the process. 
So it was some trepidation that I watched Battle in Nagoya but apparently the studio had just been cured of a disease in-between cours because there's absolutely no production issues in the show whatsoever (or at least none that's really noticeable). The action scenes are consistently fluid for the most part and the pacing, whilst still taking a little too long to get places at times, actually gives off a feeling of stuff actually happening. Said feeling hit a speed bump when the show ends on yet another cliffhanger with little manga material to make a third season in the near future but hey, points for actually getting me somewhat into this series this time. 
I'm not going to bother recapping the plot since this is a second cour and you'd only care if you watched the first one, so let's just say that after Yu and Mika had their long-awaited gay reunion, ending with the former awakening to hilariously inaccurate monstrous powers that couldn't hit the broadside of a barn, the vampires and the anti-vampire military gear up for another war and Yu's squad leave their high school roots in order to train with the big boys. But as was hinted at the cliffhanger at the end of the first cour, said military isn't exactly the most pacifistic people on the planet, and unlike the military in Attack on Titan, they're not exactly open about it. As such, a lot of internal strife occurs whilst we wait for the two sides to clash, and it's not like the vampire side consists solely of BFFs either given how Mika still refuses to drink blood. 
I have a sneaking feeling that Wit Studio randomly came across the manga one day, noticed how similar it was to Attack on Titan, and that was all they needed to pick it up for adaptation, because Battle in Nagoya borrows a lot of plot points from that show and the director does his damn best to capture Araki's theatrical bombast whenever he can, what with the dramatic shoutings in regards to squad members whining about how they're all a family and the fight scenes themselves going for epic brutality. Although Seraph of the End's homosexual coupling of Yu and Mika brings Sunrise more to my attention given how much BL material always seems to make it into their stuff, right down to having an anime named after it. And good god does the show double down on the BL when the two finally meet again. Remember in Tokyo Ghoul how there was this human girl who was willing to let some of her flesh get eaten if it meant her ghoul boyfriend can stay alive? Well guess what Yu's solution is to keep Mika alive when he realizes that he can't survive without blood? 
Speaking of Mika, he was always a bit of a whiner in regards to his best friend, but whilst he never becomes the male version of Yuno Gasai, his feelings for Yu border on the obsession here. You guys know about the Bechdel Test? Well replace ""women"" with ""Yu"" and Mika would fail it within the first fucking syllable of whatever sentence he speaks. And that's not even getting into the fact that he makes it very clear that anyone who's not Yu can die in a ditch, which Yu obviously has problems with given that he's still an incredibly generic protagonist who fights for his friends and will trust them even when they stab him in the back. 
Mika's growing problems and Yu's lack of growth aside, I actually found the characters more engaging in this iteration, particularly Shinoa - who was more a snarky comic relief character in the first season, but mostly has to rely on using that personality as a defense mechanism now that shit has gone serious and the importance of her family name is afflicting one of her squad members. Most of them are still simplistically written and all, mostly acting as Yu's cheerleaders with the only real story being given to Shiho at the very end when it's revealed what happens to his sister, but since they're not given any more focus than necessary this time around, it's not hard to tolerate them. I'm not sure what the common consensus is for Guren himself, but whilst his story does make him more interesting, it's also incredibly predictable and I found myself really unable to care for the chemistry that Yu seems to have with him. Did he really help the kid that much to the point that Yu would sacrifice his life for him as much as his friends and Mika? I can't seem to recall anything in particular. 
Unfortunately, whilst the execution is better, the core of Seraph is still about as substantial as Mac in Cheese without any salt or pepper put into it. The structure is the same as the first cour in that the first half or so is dedicated to building our protagonists up and the second cour is when things come to a clash before ending on a cliffhanger. And no amount of people dying bloody deaths along with the overall theatrical presentation can make me overlook the fact that the show doesn't put enough spins on its genre cliches to make that structure stand out in any way, unless you count what ultimately becomes of Yu's squad when Mika throws a wrench into the whole ""all vampires are evil"" way of thinking as fresh. It certainly opens the way to something fresh, as (spoilers) I've never seen a shonen action anime cast our protagonists as fugitives, Deathly Hallows-style, before. But that's at the very end, and everything prior to that is just a bunch of flamboyancy taken seriously so that it's kind of funny at times, but ultimately it's not doing anything new that you haven't seen before in vampire fiction (current or old). It's like a less stupid but still nothing ""must see"" version of that Let Me In film. 
So whilst I can recommend Battle in Nagoya with much less reservations than the first Seraph, I think you guys are better off waiting for the Attack on Titan sequel...whenever that shows up.

    Before you read this, there are spoilers, so um if you like those-YEAH, READ ON! (I'm trying my best not to spoil, but um yeah how can you not?) 
This anime scares.  The episodes leading up the ending genuinely scared me.  Seriously. 
So, I'm believing the plot was basically all leading up to this, all of the experimentation on humans.  I never really did believe that the humans and vampires were doing human experimentation until the episode they actually showed one of the 'test subjects.' I thought it was all a lie for Mika to get Yuu to come with him.  Little did I know he was telling the truth, which was honestly very surprising for me, which led me to getting scared.  So, at the end of episode 12, it shows our new protagonists, Yuu; Mika; Shinoa; Kimizuki; Narumi; Yoichi; and Mitsuba. They are currently running from the humans and the vampires, doing their own thing, which is what Mika always wanted so yay for Mika! 
Here's my actual review for the anime! : 
Story : 6/10 
At the beginning, I honestly very much liked this anime.  It used to be one of my favorites.  That was before I realized how very terrifying this actually was.  It reminds of a lot of giant Western franchises, as well, which is why I ranked it just a tad bit lower, ONLY because it might've just been a coincidence that this reminds me of so many things. 
The story actually wasn't that bad in the beginning (TT^TT), though it was meant to take this dark turn, which wasn't really that dark, considering some things. 
Art : 8/10 
If I had actually watched this in HD (no, I don't use illegal streaming sites, or free streaming sites), it would've been AMAZING.  But to me it just looked like your average anime.  The animation, however, is amazing and must've been very hard to pull off, with Yuu transforming into the Seraph of the End, and the way some of the weapons have very unique textures and forming sequences. Overall, pretty awesome. 
Sound : 8/10 
I always rate anime sounds high. :/  
The music is amazing, reminds of when Sword Art Online was actually good.  But it doesn't remind me that much of it, which is amazing.  It also gives me a very nice vibe of uniqueness that is very hard to pull off.  The voice acting was amazing as well, which is NOT expected from what I was guessing it to be. 
Character : 6/10 
There are three basic supernatural your character can be.  Human, vampire, or demon.  Pretty cliche unhumanly types, vampire and demon. 
The character development is there, it's just that you can get so much into the anime that you can't notice it, or you DO notice it because Yuu keeps saying ""I'm much stronger than before! ;)""  Other than that, you can notice that there is a lot of character development, but it's not very interesting, just in my opinion. 
Enjoyment : 4/10 
My enjoyment for the first season was way different, due to the fact I kinda... watched it in a day.  But for this season, I just watched because  
1. cliffhanger 
2. the community 
3. the constant build-up of hype for the second season. 
Overall, I would score this anime a 5, maybe a 5.5, still deciding whether or not I'll have nightmares.

    Here is the thing: Owari no Seraph is a piece of mindless entertainment. It has everything to keep you occupied for a couple of hours but sadly not much else.  
Story is pretty dumb. It is just there to justify the characters movement across the screen. We have a lot of angst and pump up drama – teen with anger issues and so on. Nothing out of ordinary! Most of the mainstream anime titles are like this. The good thing is that the apocalyptic scenery is constantly been overlapped by clichés such as school life, friendship and snippy remarks which makes the whole thing hilarious! For that help a lot the smugdere – Shinoa and here we go to the second point: 
Characters: Again nothing special. Overused archetypes and MC is fucked up emo shit but still their conversations are entertaining and cute at times. Not to mention the smugdere queen ;) 
Music: It is over average. It is not the best Sawano  work out there but it has more than enough good tracks. Especially in season two. OP/ED were nice as well.  
Art/ character designs: Well good over all but not the greatest. The backgrounds were interesting but not used optimally much of the time. The characters are mostly bishies and bishoujos so no complains there. 
Enjoyment: For me it was entertaining enough. I don`t look for the deeper meaning so I was more than happy with what I got.  
Special note: Shounen ai vibes during the anime. Yep! One of the things I found hilarious! Especially the comments afterwards LOL. Come on! A few longing face expressions haven`t killed anyone. Don`t make it such a big deal ;) 
Overall: I like it but won`t watch it a second  time.  
Story – 5 
Characters – 7 
Music – 8 
Art – 7 
Enjoyment – 9 
Overall – 7,2

    Ah, Shonuen.  For most, it's the gateway genre into anime as beating the shit out of people through epic action sequences with swords, magic, what have you is quite amusing to many, and the power of friendship or something like that is also quite fun to watch, apparently.  But then you have series that just...sort of push the envelope on what they want to do and it just sort of...falls flat. 
Story: Picking up from where the first season of Owari no Seraph ended off, Nagoya, as I'll call this second season continues our adventures of our merry family of vampire killers as they come across more secrets, more vampires, and well...a lot of spare blood dying.   
Owari no Seraph has a very glaring issue when it comes to storytelling, and that is balance.  Like the season before it, Nagoya focuses heavily on the 'bonds' between the members of the main cast and their bond together as 'family.'  Now, as a concept, this would be ok, since most shonuen have this kind of concept to their storyline since most protagonists feel they need to SAVE EVERYONE or what have you.  But in Owari's case, they really shove it down your throat.  You can't really go five minutes in the show without someone shouting out either the word family or alluding to it, and it's just irritating.  They focus so much on these bland characters and their 'connection as a family' that the show as a whole takes a nosedive in quality because they try to make us care about them more so than the actual plot of the show, thus bringing me to my next point. 
The world of Owari no Seraph is decently crafted.  Contrary to the first season, we get answers.  Not many answers mind you, but answers.  As such, the plot and what is happening does start to make some sense, and I genuinely think that the way this world was made is actually interesting.  But because the show puts so much focus on the people of the show and not so much as to what is happening, the show really suffers since it's not really able to expressively give itself out as a story while it has these half-assed characters drag itself down with it.  (Seriously though, the concept of the seraphs, demons, vampires, etc is all really interesting.) 
And then we have one of the bigger issues aside from its bullshit family motif, the pacing.  The pacing of the show is subpar at best.  At time, it really drags itself out, while other times, it rushes itself a lot.  For the most part, these pacing issues occur during the 'character' and the 'plot' parts respectively since, as I've mentioned before, the show puts more focus on its characters rather than its plot.  In the end, we got a lot of possibly great storytelling with a lot of not so great parts in between it.  Especially since the last episode had so much, but was a horrible end because they rushed it to all hell without any explanation and essentially set up a season 3.  (Wit Studio, plz.  Don't do this.)   
+ Good World (Honestly, the world that this show is in is quite interesting) 
-  Pacing issues 
-  Family motif.  (It's not so much as a motif as it is a word they shove down your throat when you're watching.) 
Characters: Oh, characters.  I have quite a bone to pick with these character not only because they're bad, but because they...are...insufferable.  A good majority of them are really quite bad to the point that you don't even want to root for them. 
Contrary to most second season reviews I do, I have to mention these ones again.  Yuu, as our main protagonist has shifted his role this season from an Eren clone vampire-killing maniac, to the guy who cannot go a single sentence or set of lines without mentioning the word family.  It's so bad to the extent that I cannot really describe him any other way simply because that's what he is.  He's a very one-note character with literally one character trait and he just isn't very interesting.  In fact, he is a character, is one I could not really care much about simply because he's just so insufferable at times to watch. 
Then we have Mikasa.  Now, I am a strong believer that Mika would've made a much better protagonist than Yuu did before, since his entire deal in the series was to protect the last person that he considered his family, (still insufferable, but it made more sense here) and he dealt with the conflicts of now being a vampire when he was previously human.  In this season however, he comes back more as a one-note character since his entire purpose is to ""Protect Yuu-chan.  Protect Yuu-chan!"" which really isn't all that interesting and just adds to how average the characters are.   
Other characters in the main cast, Shinoa, Mitsuba, Kimizuki, etc, are all pretty much shafted to the side.  Guren however gets this trait that isn't ever really explained (but you can kind of infer) but really, these characters all don't change and are less important than they were made out to be in season one.  That's not to say that's a bad thing since a lot of their character traits (except Shinoa, though, she is less snarky than she was before, and that's what made her great) are intolerable to listen to or deal with at times.   
And then we have the side cast, or spare blood.  Now, a lot of the characters that we are introduced to in this new season are for the most part, just fodder for the series.  A lot of them get killed and it really doesn't really tug your heartstrings.  This is mostly due to the fact that the show tries to really emphasize its 'character' half of the show but fails on account of its generally one note cast.  As such, you have a lot of deaths that really either don't matter or are made without really any explanation as to why they were killed.  (Note, what happened in the last episode.)  Another issue is the lack of antagonist motivation.  Ever villain has a motive for doing what they do, but in this case, the show doesn't really have much explanation.  Both humans and vampires have villains with their own agenda, but because the show never fully devotes itself to the actual plot of the show, these 'villainous agendas' are left quite hung up to dry and really are just stupid for the most part since what they're doing is obviously dumb when you look at what's going on.  (How do you save humanity by killing your own people?  Anyone else see the fault in logic here?) 
-  One note characters 
-  Most of the main cast kinda gets shafted 
-  Most of the cast is just spare blood for the most part 
-  Villains have unclear motivations 
-  Mika kinda sucks now... 
Art: Produced by Wit Studio, Nagoya boasts the same kind of animation quality that its first season had.  Having fluid battle scenes, high quality animation, and overall very nice effects, details, and stunning backgrounds.   
There's not really much to say about the art because it genuinely is good, and there's really nothing bad to say.   
+  Good, high quality art 
Sound:  Inversely, the sound is a bit...meh.  With its new OP made by Fripside called ""Two souls"", Nagoya has a bit of a different feel to its first OP since it's a bit more generic than its first opening.  Fripside is a good artist, as she's done OPs for other shows like Black Bullet and Railgun, but this one...just doesn't seem to cut it. 
The ED on the other hand has a more of a gospel or choir feel to it, harking back to the ""seraph"" of the show which similar to its respective OP, is a good song, but isn't really memorable or really all that special.   
+  Good songs 
-  Not really memorable or unique 
Personal Enjoyment: I don't like Owari no Seraph.  As a series, I feel like it had so much potential, but falls VERY flat because it tried to make itself a character-based show, when it really should be a plot-based show because it had so much potential and so many great concepts that just were either not explained, or were rushed with little to no explanation. 
I like the concept of the seraph and what it is in this series.  Lack of explanation didn't help the show, but hey, it's the concept that really intrigued me. 
Pretty much...everything else.  The characters are insufferable, the concept of family is complete bullshit, the story is crap, the villains are crap, the amount of spare blood we have is stupidly large...need I say more?  If it wasn't clear enough, I personally think that Owari no Seraph is just bad.  There're far too many problems with it to make me even consider it as a half-decent series.  Also, that goddamn ferrari in episode 6.  Just...why was that even in there.  Why? 
No.  If you want to know anything about the series, read it.  The timeframe that this anime provides and the amount of family stuff they choke you with equated to a lackluster story and lack of explanation.  As such, a lot of the concepts that this show has is just not explained, the biggest reason as to why I say that this show is just not worth the time to watch.

    As adaptations go, OwaSeri S2 has proven to be somewhat of a disappointment especially since I was awfully hyped for it. For newbies pondering on whether to pick this up, I strongly recommend you read the manga first, which has in my opinion much higher quality art, not to mention actual plot explanations which for some reason the anime has conveniently shaved off, understandably culminating in viewers new to the franchise writing it off as plotless and pointless. Only with an actual understanding of what the hell is actually going on will you be able to even begin to enjoy the anime for its lovely animation and superb soundtrack. 
Going into the second season of Owari no Seraph, I was afraid that the producers would pull another Fullmetal Alchemist and deviate completely from the manga's plotline. While they appear to have avoided such a catastrophe in the larger picture, they have also completely eradicated the nuances in the manga indicative of character growth and replaced them with scenes undoubtedly meant to pander to the likes of various shippers. Similarly, emotional scenes which most left an impact while reading have either completely disappeared or been redrawn in a manner that makes it nigh impossible to refute any judgements of predictability or cliche that this current season 2 has drawn. I've got my own ships and biases (YES, mika/yuu; guren/shinya) but still the manner in which these relationships were portrayed ... was just bad. Cringe-worthy- I say this as a shipper. 
The final episode overtakes the manga (at least the eng subbed version) so I understand and echo the confusion that arises from the sudden appearance of many GIANT plotholes; I'm hoping the manga will provide a comprehensive answer to my questions... then again, if we're talking about OwaSeri S2 as an anime in its own right, it shouldn't have to lean on its manga for quality plot and should (but has failed) to stand alone in this aspect. 
To sum it up, those new to the entire OnS franchise should give the anime a miss; delve straight into the manga and if it's enough to make you a fan come back to watch your favourite scenes being animated.

    Owari no Seraph Seson 2 was great. I just thought of the final fight between the humans and the vampires to be very bad. It could have ended better that for example guren to turn back to hes normal self, they also could have made it that kimizukis sister was saved and some others. But all in all the story was amazing the main characters designs were incredible. I love yuu as a character hes a really nice fighter and a great addition to the team. 
If you guys have something to add plz comment on the review i will gladly read them.

    Sound 3 
I cannot recall anything of the music from either seasons. That's a bad sign. 
Art 6 
While some scenes were very nicely animated, I just don't like the character designs at all and nothing really stands out for me.  
They did this thing a lot where they'd have this painted background but then the actual characters would be brightly and clearly animated in front of it. The contrast was just really jarring. 
As for character designs....Ugh. The main character could not have a more generic main character design. Black spiky hair. Angry-looking most of the time. Some nice green eyes. He was just so generic, and I haven't even gotten to his personality yet.  
The blonde pig-tailed girl also had a terrible character design. Every time she'd come on screen I'd shield my eyes or try to avoid looking at her. Her hair was just so disgusting....And that brings me onto the other bad parts of the character designs. 
Their hair. All of their hair was really ugly and distracting, like the girl's hair mentioned above. Also, the brown-haired, wimpy side-kick's hair bugged me throughout the entire show. He needs a hair cut or just a shave. Please. (I also really hated how the noses were drawn with a passion.) 
The uniforms also really bothered me. They were quite detailed for a post-apocalyptic setting, like they put most of their research budget into developing those uniforms. Also, why did all of the girls except ONE wear skirts? Why? Just why? They are doing some serious combat and yet they have skirts. It just seems absolutely illogical, especially for an anime that seemed to be trying to take itself seriously (maybe?). 
Characters 1 
That's right, characters get a nice 1. They were atrocious. The only character I liked in the ENTIRE series was Mika. And he barely showed up at all in both seasons. And on top of that he was always full of angst and rarely made sense.  
As for all of the other characters, their personalities were so cut and paste and bland that I don't even need to touch on them, except for one. 
The main character. While he was basically a combination of Eren Jeager, with his constant call for revenge, and Natsu Dragontail(sp?), with his obsession with family, he really bugged me as a character. He is one of the most OP main character's I've ever come across. If something is not going well for him, he usually passes out and wakes up completely rejuvenated, and also with the added bonus of forgetting most of the bad stuff that happened. He also cannot be defeated. On top of having the special black demon weapon thing or whatever it's called, he has another extra bonus that I won't spoil. But basically whenever he needed a power-up that him being special couldn't already solve, he could go to his bonus. Using his bonus should have had really bad repercussions, but in fact it was the exact opposite. He can basically do anything and never be defeated. He's not even a character...More like a nice handy tool. 
Story 1 
I am kind reviewing both seasons, but as I don't remember many of the details from season 1, I'm just going to kind of describe the situation. 
Owari no Seraph is what you'd get if you took the fantasies of a teenager full of angst and puberty and made it into an anime. There is no cohesion within the ""story"" and there are tons of unrealistic events. The humans are more like super-humans with their ability to survive serious injuries like large, gaping, holes in the gut and falling through four stories of building. There is absolutely no realism. 
I don't even want to dwell on how bad this story is anymore. Le'ts just say that my favorite episode of both seasons is also the one that everyone happens to make the most crack videos out of. 
Overall 3 
DON'T WATCH THIS ANIME! ...unless you like crappy unrealistic fights and drama that makes little to no sense. Just shut your brain off and you'll likely enjoy it. I have a friend who is absolutely in love with this show, but then again she likes all of the anime I consider crap. It all depends on your tastes so don't take my word for it, we probably have different opinions (though probably not...don't watch this...you probably deserve better...).

    Have you seen a shounen without fanservice? Me neither. Until last week. 
Story is about storylines crossing themselves several times and destroying themselves/creating new ones. 
Outro and Intro very good. Good SFX that improves the quality of the anime. Not like Danmachi horrible destruction sound. 
Characters? Said it all. 
Really enjoyable. Don't forget it's ""just"" a shounen. The storyline makes it very impressive and superior to other shounen. Most characters aren't annoying AND have developpment. Not all have improves on their mind probably because some of them don't have their stories finished ;) 
Last thing to say, this anime is like the last time you got laid... It was quick. But hey. Felt good!

    RE POST AFTER GETTING TAKEN DOWN 
I watch this show like its heroin 
Out of all the fall/winter shows of 2015-2016, this is one of my favorites (one punch man is the other one, but lets save that for another time shall we!). 
I cum a bit in my pants every time i hear the theme song (I could impregnate the world with the amount of times) 
________________________________________________________ 
Now lets move on to the more educated side of my argument... 
Story: i want to say like 9 or 10, but its kinda an 8 (8.5 tops) 
The theme of the show is, ""family comes first"", for all those who didn't have those annoying 11th grade theme analysis essays basically the show is a battle field of pain but it is the strong bonds that the characters have to one another that allow them to have a will to go on. The good thing about this show is that it is a bit like game of thrones or the walking dead in a way that the writers don't give a shit about you and will kill off or destroy a character. 
Main Characters: 8  
Bacicly ya got ya main character Yu, who the story revolves around, all connections and sub plots have to do with him. He is strong but isn't an overpowered man beast like kirito in sword art online. But the thing that make him a likable character is his will to go on, but again the writers can break this rule and give a sense of hopelessness. 
Other Characters: 10 
The reason I praise the writers with a glorious ten is because they stuck with the focus that this story was going to be about Yu. The rest of the characters have a just enough detail about them, that provides backstory to support their motives (however they don't hopelessly strangle out all their choices because of ""back then""), they also now appear as people, instead of random characters that we are like ""who's is that guy"".  
Ok I'm getting tired of writing about characters, Lets move on! 
Action : Fuck the system I give an eleven (that's ""11"" for those who can't read) 
The action is a BIG part of the show. It has no weird way of fighting, but each person has a special that is well.... EPIC (ha u thought I was going to say special). And these epic moves are not just a bigger explosion caused by how much you scream certain words, Instead for example on of the main/ side characters has some kind of Bill Cosby special, as in when he opens his coffin the target is paralyzed/ fallen asleep (ok, in words that dosn't sound that cool but trust me, it be coolio). 
Sound: 10, it makes me orgasm (it is a soundgasm) 
just listen to it your self: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orK6WZbSaPg&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLiv4XcYJxUOpG9MBb8JzaQ-2fqwMR-S8v  
Did it make you a bit wet? (don't lie, I know that you just changed your pants) 
ART - 9.99999999 - it has beautiful backgrounds that look like they should be hung up in an art gallery, however the character look fantastic too but have a tiny bit of contrast with the background that makes them seem a bit like the animation from south park. 
ENJOYMENT IS OVER 9000 
I love this show and will continue binge watching it to make up for my shit life.  
:)

    ******************Spoilers(kinda, not really)*********************** 
************************************************************** 
  Now that you have been properly warned, we can continue. Ill start off by saying that I don't usually write reviews for anime, or really any other type of media that I find enjoyment in unless I really have something to say about it. Well, this is one of those anime that I want to say something about. Now, what I want to say is not necessarily bad, I enjoyed watching this, and I would recommend it to any one who wants something quick to watch in the dry seasons. 
***************************ART(8)******************************** 
  The art was pretty good, I liked it a lot, it wasn't fresh and new like a big budget triple A anime, it was gritty, and it really fit the idea of the story well. The characters looked good, and the fighting and the weapons were pretty cool as well. 
**************************SOUND(7+)*************************** 
  To be completely honest I didn't pay much attention to the music like I usually do, but when I did sit back to listen to the intros, or the music in the Anime I enjoyed it. The sound design on the other hand I did pay some attention to and I liked it, I liked how you could here the trailing and echoing of the characters voices in a room, and the monsters sounded pretty cool too. The character voice acting (SUBBED) was pretty good as well. 
*************************CHARACTERS(6+)********************** 
  The characters were fine, they served their purposes well, and for the most part I enjoyed them. Yu's character development from the first season was a difficult slope, that at time, he would revert back to his more immature state with a lot of (family this, and family that, and ""he stabbed me but ill be fine cuz family"") but for the most part he did mature throughout the anime. Yu was really the only character with major development, most of the other characters stayed relatively static. The reason I don't rate them higher, or go to far in depth with them is because of my next reason. 
*****************************STORY(IDK)*********************** 
  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know how I feel about this story. Do you want to know why I don't know? BECAUSE WHERE THE FUCKS THE REST OF IT? THATS WHY. There was just so much unanswered, there was so much started and never finished, they were still introducing characters towards the end of the second season, like the Guren look alike, and the entire Hiragi family outside of Shinoa, ok that one was closer to the beginning of the second season, but the ratio of story/plot/idea to episode  made the second season (feel) incredibly short. The producers of this anime could have milked this idea for days, they could have easily made a 3rd even a 4th season with what they were given, but no, it was rushed towards the end leaving a lot unexplained. Like what happened between the romance of Shinoa and Yu? What happened to Yu trying to change Mika back to a human, what Happened to Kimizuki's sister and how did she become the (SPOILERS) angle.  Now before anyone corrects me, I know there's a manga and I bet reading it would answer 91% of my questions but Im not talking about the manga. Another thing that bothered me about this story was the producers use of our old friend ""Deus ex machina"". An example would be(spoilers) in the later part of season two, Mika, after getting fucked up by the Demon army, saves Yu, and runs away from the fight, and even further away from the final plot location. And in a tense situation at said final plot area, look who shows up, arriving on the 9:30 Deus EXpress? Mika, Yu, and Guren, who previously was captured and injured. Another example would be Yu's several attempts at suicide, and every single time he was rushed to Saint Jude's ex machina children's hospital and saved for the next episode. 
************************ENJOYMENT(8)************************** 
  Aside from all this nit-pickey shit, I enjoyed this anime, it was something I looked forward to see on the weekend, and I plan to watch the OVA when it comes out. And if your reading this review I highly recommend watching it, its something fine to add to you collection of finished episodes, and it can be used to fill up any dry season... I even have a few desktop backgrounds ^.^

    For now, the Seraph of the End series comes to an end with this explosive season. I admit the first season didn't really impress me and it was only till the OVAs that I started to get emotionally invested in Seraph of the End. So, does this season deliver a satisfying conclusion. Well, let's hop on and find out! 
Warning! Spoiler alert! 
The adventures of Yuuichirou and friends' continue as they are assigned a new mission that might change the course of the war. Meanwhile, Mikaela is more determined than ever to save Yuu, even if that means succumbing deeper and deeper into his vampire instincts. I have to say, the struggles of both Yuuichirou and Mikaela to retain their humanity are perfectly contrasted with one another across this season, what with Yuu obtaining more demonic power while Mikaela being forced to drink human blood for the first time since he became a vampire. There's a lot of payoff in this season, both for the character arcs and the larger narrative. 
The world-building is more noticeable with this season, as we learn more about the inhuman experimentation that caused the human-vampire war in the first place and the role the Hiiragi family plays in military affairs. This season really dwells on the ""humans can be just as cruel and monstrous as vampires"" theme, as both sides resort to dirtier and more underhanded tactics to win the war. The show also ups in the ante in regards to the battles, with vampiric and demonic powers in full display. If you came here to watch incredible action scenes, you won't be disappointed. (8/10) 
The character development in this season was outstanding. The characters we see at the end of this season are not the same characters we saw at the beginning of the first, and that deserves no shortage of praise. Yuu becomes nobler and more heroic in this season and we see him stop grieving about the family he lost and start caring about the family he has now. The show is also really good at delivering a sympathetic portrayal for Mikaela, who does his best to keep his vampire side at bay and navigate the treacherous vampire landscape in an attempt to survive and see Yuu again. Yuu and Mika have the best relationship in this show, and they have some beautiful and poignant moments together. 
I also liked how close Yuu has become with his other friends, especially Shinoa, who stops acting arrogant and cavalier about life and shows some overt affection for their friends. Like I said before, there's a lot of payoff in this season and overall, the character are in a much better place than they were in the beginning. (9/10) 
Studio Wit delivers outstanding visual quality for Seraph of the End, as was the case in previous seasons. The battles look magnificent and the characters move fluidly and seamlessly across shots. Since I'm no animation expert, there's not much I can do to pick the show's art style and animation apart, but I'm still pleased with the results. (9/10) 
Sounds 
The soundtrack was fine. Not great, just fine. I did like the closer, though. It gives the show a rare sense of levity and tranquility. The vocal performances were amazing. Micah Solusod, Justin Briner and Felecia Angelle do an amazing work, no thanks in small part to the strength and dramatic effect of the script. (9/10) 
In closing here, Battle in Nagoya was an excellent way to conclude the Seraph of the End, at least for now. It double-down on the first season's strengths and corrected several of its flaws. Since the manga is still ongoing, I really hope we get an adaptation in the future. There are still battles left to be fought. (8/10)

    *Since there arent really positive reviews i will make one.,and sry bout the spoilers...* 
  So the story..oh well damn i can say that is full with cliffhangers,large scale battles happen and the characters(especially the MC) grow even stronger.What can i say..it was better,or at least it had more action than the first season.here we see more betrays and a darker humanity. 
  The art is outstanding as the previous season was.Same with the sound,nothing really different here. 
  The characters develop deeper bonds also getting  stronger along the way.Yuu and Mika are finally together and Asura and Yuu are friends.Sadly we do not see Mika developing more than just becoming a full vampire.The characters develop more as a team not individually and that's a bit sad.I would like to see more backstories,learn more of their past. 
  I did enjoy this season more than the first and i recomend you watching both since they need each other.I  feel more sentiments mixed from friendship taken to extreme and hatred for humanity.Just to make it clear i despite betrayers.

    This is a good anime. Is it great? Eh, some might think so. But it's not a bad anime.  
The story, in my opinion, is amazing. It's very interesting and deep, but in the anime it takes quite a while to get interesting, or to get people interested in the story itself.  
Art style is I guess ""basic anime style"". It has some good and some bad.  
I really love the ost in this season. They really nailed the music in this one.  
Because I am me, I always fall in love with the side characters who aren't even the main side characters. So I only started to really like the main characters at the end of this (second) season. I think they're great characters but the anime couldn't do them all justice with such short episodes/seasons when so much is happening. (My favorite is Shinya, so. You know.) 
So, overall it's a good anime. It did take me like almost two seasons to get properly interested in everything (I did enjoy this and the first season, but the main reason why I continued to watch this was Shinya), but that's just because I am me and I'm weird. Might change my opinion on the overall score later, but this anime belongs to the 6-10 range.

    This review will not contain any heavy spoilers. I will mostly comparing how things are in this season than the first season. 
""More fujobait but gets way better than the first season."" 
It gets way better than the first season. We got a lot more backgrounds on what's happening. The start are kinda slow and filled with daily lives of them in the main basecamp and some events to tie up the ""Yuu's awakening"" incident. The main story kicks in a few episodes later where they are sent to Nagoya for war, hence the season title. The finale was also as great as the first season. 
Art : 9/10 
The art are as good as the first season with oily hand-drawn paintings as backgrounds, and it meshes well with the animation that used thick lines as borders. The animation also got better, no more awkward scenes like where Mika's feet gliding trough the stairs like in the first season. 
Sound : 10/10 
Sawano Hiroyuki. Also we now got fripSide for OP and Yanagi Nagi for ED, I particularly loved the ED. 
Character : 8/10 
Now Yuu aren't as annoying as he was in S1, he's gotten more mature somehow and doesn't yell ""I'm going to kill every vampires"" every 5 minutes anymore. Another notable improvements are Shinoa and Guren, now Shinoa got more personalities than just the smugness people praise her for. We also got a better look at Guren's personalities. Overall the Shinoa squad members' interaction are better with each other. And we also got more Mika on screen now. 
Enjyoment : 8/10 
Shonen being a shonen, the battle hype is really good, it was fun to see people hacking up other people with swords and various arms imbued with a demon. There are also a few comedy scenes which is good to break the ice. 
Overall : 9/10 
tl;dr It's better than the first season, if you didn't like the first one, you might like this one.

          Normally I dont write anime reviews but when i saw this i understood that i have to change my mind and write something about this ""anime"". 
First of all i have to admit that the anime adaptation is really good and i am refering to the animation quality and to the music. But there are so many plot and character holes that made me feel that i wasted my time. Also we dont have to forget that this anime series is full of cliche in both story and characters, which havent been made well. However the main problem is that you cant understand the true goal of the mangaka, he probably wants to explain some issues but he cant and he creates many others. In the duration of this season you expect that you are going to solve some mysteries but finally you get nothing. The holes become far deeper. Last but not least because the majority of the fans watches something for the enjoyment , personally i believe that there is no enjoyment in such a thing.

    Seraph of the End is pretty dark for a shounen series. People can straight up die when you least expect it, make gruesome sacrifices, fight desperately to their last breath, and make positively evil schemes. But all of this is what makes Seraph of the End so interesting. 
The story of Seraph of the End gets more interesting in this second season as we learn a lot about Yu, meet new characters and experience shocking plot twists and meet new antagonists. I was very shocked at the character who reappeared at the last episode, and are very interested about the past of a certain Lieutenant Colonel. As always, Seraph of the End's story this second season was very good and kept me interested to the very end. 
The art of Seraph of the End continues to be superb, as always the animators over at Wit Studio are doing their best. Some scenes are amazing to watch, especially the battles. I hope Wit keeps this level of quality consistent. 
The sounds of Seraph of the End do their job service-ably. Whenever a certain scene would begin with a certain mood, the music would match it perfectly. I understood exactly what was being conveyed by the music, which did it's job. 
The characters in this Anime continue to be interesting as we learn more about several of them, and their are one or two shocking revelations here and there. We also meet new characters, as well as witness the ""End"" of many of them. The people behind Seraph of the End's story continue to write great characters and interesting twists. 
Overall, I'm going to give Seraph of the End a 9/10 on enjoyment and my overall score. Seraph of the End season 2 is perfectly fine for those who liked the first season, and I recommend this series for people who aren't snobs that have a stick up their ass about shounen.  
Thanks for reading.

    I like to write my reviews to the point and with little bullshit, so, i'll get to it. This show isn't as bad as some say, and not as good as some say. If people say it's bad they are over exaggerating cause it's better than a lot of the slice of life plague or poorly put together anime adaptations of ecchi mangas. And it's certainly not an epic that everyone should watch. However, that's not to say you shouldn't watch it.  
If you're a fan of action anime, this is probably your cup of tea. If you're more of a story kind of guy well then you might have to force yourself to drink the tea, but leave with the word of ""meh"" filling your mind and will probably re-evaluate your choices in tea.  
This show got kind of hot and heavy in this second season, which is was fine and dandy. Problem is it got rushed making anyone who watches it break out into a sweat from running through the plot so fast all in one episode. The final episode just bust out all the stops and sped through probably about 3-4 episodes of material all leading up to another season which will take a while to come out. 
So, go watch Attack on Titan because this show is basically that but with the power of friendship or family or something.

    Do you ever have that one anime where you feel as though there was many things going on but still feeling like there was no impact to any of it? Anime that are of the action genre often come into this dilemma. Ones that have an overarching story that tries to make it grand and epic, only to squander it by not giving much to go on. It doesn’t help with a short 12-13 episode season. Considering that Owari no Seraph had a 2nd season in the same year in order to facilitate its story longer and still come off short is basically rubbing salt in the wound. 
To go back on the first season for a bit, since I never reviewed it, my initial impression of the story was incredibly underwhelming. I thought the way it told a revenge plot involving a boy who wants to kill vampires who killed all of his friends was too simple and drab for me to take seriously. There are ways in which this could work but with Owari no Seraph’s case it comes across as predictable and hamfisted with the melodrama. Not only is the story itself nothing special, but the way it is presented is all over the place. Most notably the pacing is what drags it down so low. There are many places where the plot just rushes along in order to get to the next battle scene without any semblance of exposition to tell the audience what exactly is going on. This is very apparent in the last episode of this season where the last ten minutes felt like there should’ve been two more episodes to fill in to make it feel more like a seamless transition from scene to scene. 
Writing is the key point to any story as well, and Owari no Seraph has probably the most boring dialogue of any shounen anime this year. It’s like the running joke in America where we think of Hollywood of just reusing cliched catchphrases we see in countless action blockbusters by putting there hand in a jar and pick whatever line is on a piece of paper. That’s what it feels like for some of the lines that lean on the “edgy” or “melodramatic” nature of Owari no Seraph. Many of the lines, even if you’re watching with the worst fansubs or know a little Japanese like I do, just reek of stale dialogue writing that even a high school student with a novice level of writing composition could do better. They can range from predictable to groan inducing on many occasions. 
Unfortunately, most of the characters here are of the same level as the story is in terms of quality. They all fall under the category of forgettable and flat, with the exception of one character that is the one ray of sunshine of this entire anime. The character I am referring to is the lovely sarcastic lady,  Shinoa Hiiragi. Although her character development is on par to the rest of the bland cast, her snarky demeanor and voiced wonderfully by Saori Hayami, who does her lines a cut above the rest. Without her, I don’t think I would’ve sat through all 24 episodes of season 1 and 2; in fact I would say the only reason I bothered to continue this was just to see more of Shinoa. Her presence in season 2 is just as good, albeit a little more serious than in the previous one which kind of disappointed me but I’ll take whatever Shinoa I can get at this point. 
Yuu proves himself to be the stereotypical edgy protagonist who shouts most of his lines and blurts out predictable vengeful lines and promises to stick with his friends lines. Admittedly, I do think Mika, Yuu’s other friend who gets turned towards the vampire side, was probably the least bad out of the suck bunch in the cast. Only because he at least had a role that was kind of captivating to see where he has to battle out his friend’s other friends in order to reunite with him. In fact, all three of these characters are the only ones I even remember. As much as I rag on Yuu’s character, at least I can remember his name and the dumb lines he spout out. You could quiz me on the rest of the characters and I will guarantee you that I would not make more than a 20% grade percentage. This being the problem of how so little development any of them have despite being in the same armed forces as Yuu and Shinoa or the vampire clan they are fighting against. The only thing we have to go on is that they are fighting an enemy that threatens their way of life, that’s about it. Whoopee. 
It is weird to analyze the technical prowess of Owari no Seraph because I do love the artwork of the characters and even some of the backgrounds look nice to look at. However the animation is very hit or miss. No where is this more evident than in the fighting scenes where there are some episodes where the animation just takes a nose dive and seems so obvious that the animators were cutting corners, possibly due to budgeting issues or whatnot. When it isn’t at such low quality, it is serviceable to the eyes and compliments the artwork. Other than the animation being a mixed bag, I genuinely love how colorful the characters look. As a matter of fact, if the characters didn’t have very distinct colorful features to their hair or skin, I think my opinion of them being forgettable would be even lower than it is. 
Vampires and humans battling out each other can be something fun on paper but rarely has there been any that succeed in reality. Had the writers took their time to develop the characters and story slowly for me to get a sense of the world, I think this could’ve been pretty good. What I got out of Owari no Seraph after finishing its 2nd season was just the biggest meh that has ever meh this year of 2015. All I got out of it was more Shinoa fanart to gaze upon with my own eyes. At least great things can come from average places. 
Grade: C-

    I wish this was not a second season and a continuation of the first season making it a total of 24 episodes that I could have rated better altogether, unfortunately that was not the case. The reason for this, is that I would have had a better Overall rating than I gave for each season on it's own. After watching the first season it was understandable that the setting needed to be revealed and back stories needed to be told, etc... so I saw it to be a little slow until it got some action after 2/3 of the anime had passed. So then I rated it a 7. I'm almost done watching this second season I know I I'll be giving it a 9. There were parts where I was anxious, surprised, concerned, sad, and I even cried a little. This season gave me what I wanted and I enjoyed it very much. 
It made me feel bad I gave the first season a 7, but that just what I felt it deserved seeing as it just ended with the god stuff happening almost to the end. So that is why I really wished it would have all been a 24 episode 1st season instead. This time, my enjoyment surely maxed out, and I was certainly not disappointed. If I had to go back and re-rate the first season knowing what would come afterward, I would have given it an 8; however, I will not because that's just how I felt it was, and having it spit up that way was not my choice. At least the first season was good enough to make me want to see this second season and I'm glad I did.  
All that being said, here are my ratings for the following: 
With season 1 out of the way, the progression of the story and this particular arc (battle of Nagoya) was very interesting to me, and we get to see a lot of action. It's what I was looking for in the first place, but it wouldn't have been as enjoyable without the story-telling in season 1. 
This rating has to do specifically with the animation and execution of the battle/fighting scenes since ,well, the overall art is the same as the first season. When I saw a noble vampire strike Guren, you could have felt the power and intensity from just watching it. 
This Mika and Yuuichiro thing is my weakness. Say yes to friendships <3 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I definitely got more into this second season than I did with the first. Looking forward to see more in the future. 
OVERALL: 8.6/10 which translates to a 9 (if you round it off hehe)

    (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!) 
A few weeks ago, I shared a meal with my grandparents, brother, and other cousins. During the dinner, we talked about all manner of topics. Our grandfather’s brother named Georgie. The notion that bigger teeth brings beauty later in life. How awesome that grand meatball tasted. 
At one point, the topic turned to familial connections, the bonds we share with each other. I stated that I would die for them. They are my family, so this statement sounds obvious. At least, I hope it is obvious for most. 
I sincerely believe it. Strangers pass by. Friends come and go. But family. Family is forever. Yu of Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen believes the same. Unfortunately for Yu, he does not get to have dinner-made conversations. Instead, he gets an almost abysmal anime. 
This second season (really the second half to the split-cour) of Owari no Seraph (called Nagoya from here on out) begins shortly after the first season (really the first half). 
The anime has a glaring issue that persists across most of this season: nothing actually happens. Hyperbole, yes. Events occur and characters move, sure. But the conclusions or outcomes are no doubt insignificant when the bigger picture is looked at. 
The anime has essentially five main conflicts that occur one after another. The first conflict is Yu’s team contrasted with Makoto’s team. The second is the multi-front battle. The third is the rescue attempt of Guren. The fourth is Yu aiding Mika. And the fifth and final conflict is the angel and demon clash at the end. Each conflict introduces drama, and each conflict does almost nothing. 
The first conflict is designed to accentuate the inexperience of Yu and the other members. They get beat by Guren and reluctantly accepted by Makoto and his team. A nice approach – except for that fact that Makoto’s team gets decimated over the course of a few episodes. Two members are killed off by some vampires, two others are killed off by the angel-demon contraption, and Makoto is left alone. Meaning the initial comparison has nothing come of it since the (supposedly) less experienced squad moves on without a single loss. 
The second conflict brings about a lot of action. People die, swords swing, and tension ensues. The purpose of the attack is to wipe out the vampires once and for all. But, as the anime shows, that is all a lie. The attack is nothing more than a sacrifice. In other words, the battling is just the myriad of characters and soldiers stalling for time – they are fighting for nothing. 
This conflict is hurt further by the audience knowing nothing of the situation. The audience learns next to nothing about the vampire society. The audience learns next to nothing about the behind-the-scenes deception of the vampires and the humans. The audience learns next to nothing about the more otherworldly aspects – namely the angels and demons. 
The third conflict revolves around getting Guren back after he gets captured. Yu being Yu, he decides to bring the fight to the vampires to save Guren, a man he considers part of his family. The resulting failure of the rescue – the attempt meant, in the end, nothing – is certainly an asinine development. But it is the later betrayal of Guren (regardless of whether he is in control or not) that turn his speeches on camaraderie and family into nothing. Plus, Guren ending up back with the humans means the rescue triply meant nothing. 
The fourth conflict is arguably the only one that means anything more than nothing. Established in the first half of the split-cour, Mika works to save Yu from the “evil” humans, forcing him to go to impossible lengths to save Yu. Furthermore, the conflict is the only one that exists throughout most of the season leading up to its finale in the grocery store. Mika becoming a vampire, despite fighting off the temptations for years and years, could arguably be more nothing-based drama. But this conflict, compared to the others, actually has a meaningful impact on both the characters involved. 
The fifth and final conflict is easily the sloppiest. The angel-demon contraption has nothing in terms of context. The vampires and the humans all do nothing as the demon comes forth. Krul Tepes is (supposedly) killed off when she does almost nothing to retaliate. Kazuki does nothing to save his sister despite how much his character is built on his strong relationship with her. Yu essentially resets everything back to how it was before the contraption appeared (minus a few characters), meaning nothing important happened plot-wise. 
Collectively, the narrative does next to nothing. 
Nagoya continues, for the most part, the artistic direction and actual animation that it had with its first half. 
The background art itself still has a painting-like quality to it. While the locations tend to blend together as grays, browns, and blacks, this dreariness contributes nicely to the dreary mood of the anime. Lighting is not as much of a focus, unfortunately, causing the anime to lose an opportunity to further cast darkness over the show. 
Nagoya’s animated sequences are a mixed bag. Downtime does have some fluidity in eye or head movements, and there are even subtle shifts, such as Shinoa moving her hair out of the way to better hear Yu’s heart or Yu scooching backward while Mika rests in his arms and bites on his neck. 
Of course, the anime also includes many a battle, yet, despite the swords, axes, and pikes, the anime rarely depicts choreographed fights. As such, the battles become less flashy and more simplistic with lots of cuts or smoke. Considering that the anime touts itself as having action, having these animated sequences be so lackluster adversely affects the anime. 
However, there are certain sequences that prove Nagoya does not always rest on its laurels. In particular, the sequence where Mika battles through a road of enemies to get to Yu involves a lot of movement, perspective, and coolness. Other sequences, like the final fight between Yu and the demon or Yu and the gang versus the top-hat vampire, while not as involved, make the anime less static than it tends to be otherwise. 
Lastly, the character designs remain the same as before. Shinoa, Yu, and the other humans are rather plain in design. Some have accessories like bows or glasses. Some have oddly colored hair. But generally their designs are not that intricate. The vampires are more eccentric than the humans, making the vampires’ designs more unique and therefore slightly stronger. 
For both groups, their actual outfits are decorated with buttons, medals, and other additions. Most interesting of all is the choice of color. The humans wear black attire whereas the vampires wear white. Color symbolism often dictates that black equates to evilness and white equates to goodness. Meaning, having the colors swapped between who one would usually believe the good and bad guys to be induces a subconscious muddying of morality. An idea that, while not explicit, has a presence in the anime. 
The characters of Nagoya are difficult to discuss mostly because the anime refuses to properly do much with them – nothingness seeped into the characters, too. 
Out of the entire cast, only two characters receive adequate attention: Mika and Guren. 
Mika continues mostly where he left off. The vampires dislike or toy with him, he hates humans, and all he thinks about is Yu – and blood. His refusal to fully turn himself into a vampire by consuming human blood (he has satiated his thirst through Krul Tepes’s blood all this time) begins to consume him, and it is this consumption that Nagoya focuses on with his character for about three-fourths of the season. His inability to control himself, his anger at himself for his urges, and his conflicting feelings towards humans. 
All the while, he never stops thinking about Yu. His actions always revolve around finding or helping Yu and not disappointing him (by becoming the very creature that Yu hates). Consequently, in what is perhaps the anime’s smartest bit of writing, he and Yu finally reunite when Mika is at his most desperate. I.e., Mika’s thirst for blood and Yu reach an apex. 
Yu, valuing family above all else (more on this shortly), gives Mika exactly what he wants: himself. Yu shares a private moment with Mika, he gives Mika his blood, and he reassures Mika that Mika will always be family to him – vampire or otherwise. The moment is nice, signifying development of Mika’s character. Afterwards, Mika still has trouble trusting humans, but he at least comes around for Shinoa and the others, turning him into the best character that Nagoya has to offer. 
Guren is the other prominent character. Outwardly, he is a jerk, a rude and arrogant dude. Inwardly, he cares deeply for his squad mates – perhaps more so than anyone else. 
Over the course of the season, he leads, he falls, and he “betrays.” Quotes because it technically is not his fault. His weapon had been implied to be difficult to control due to the strength of the spirit possessing it and Guren’s love for said spirit. (Shinoa’s older sister in both cases.) So him succumbing to temptation is not completely out of the question. 
The real problem with the betrayal is that it (like the story) does next to nothing. Yes, Guren’s tears while in his possessed form indicate that his true self hates the kin-killing monster he becomes. But it serves little purpose. His actions do not drastically affect the outcome of the season. He does not confront major players besides Yu who, in response, just spouts even more dialogue on family. And, most importantly, Guren’s betrayal does nothing for himself. The betrayal (and, indeed, the whole season) does not provide growth for his character whatsoever. 
To be fair, Guren is humanized through a flashback involving him and Yu. He compares himself to Yu, encouraging him, advising him to live and push on until the day he can fight for the one who needs his help. Shinya, seemingly his best friend, also humanizes Guren indirectly: Guren wholly trusts Shinya, counting on Shinya to save everyone in his stead and proving how good a friend Guren can be. These instances make up for some of the improper handling of his character but not all of it. 
Now, due to the focus on Mika and Guren (and the focus on a story that does nothing), the rest of the cast is forgotten about. Deeply forgotten about. And that is putting it lightly. 
Yu starts to leave his him-against-the-world mentality, relying more on his comrades and acting more friendly towards them. However, he still spouts the same dialogue about family over and over. He is certainly consistent in his ideals which deserves a small amount of praise, but he repeats the same thoughts on family ad nauseam, turning him into an annoyance rather than a worthwhile character. He does seem to gain some control of his powers near the end of the season, but, because the angel and demon concepts had gone unexplained up to that point, his control does not make much sense. 
Shinoa, arguably the most popular character of the anime, loses her edge. In an attempt to mold her into a more serious, reliable leader, the anime cuts down on her smug, snarky attitude – her defining trait. The tradeoff, not surprisingly, failing to work. As a leader, she gets her group into horrible situations and even causes issues (and deaths) for others based on her decisions. And because her smugness heavily disappears, so does her intrigue. And despite her older sister gaining (a minimal amount of) relativity, Shinoa’s overall importance to the anime diminishes. 
The rest of the main group – Mitsuba, Kimizuki, and Yoichi – are painfully forgotten about. Mitsuba has an older sister that seems to be working for the evil humans, but, similar to Shinoa, that relationship is not expounded on. Kimizuki gets a small moment near the end of the season where his beloved sister, the girl who his entire character revolves around, is subjected to horrific treatment. But when he is thwarted with a single sword stab and when he chooses to abandon his sister without putting up much of a fight, Kimizuki becomes more of a joke than a person. As for Yoichi, he may as well not even exist for how much the anime ignored him. 
Everybody else cannot be discussed because they are even less prevalent than these three. And as far as themes are concerned, the obvious one is family. Different aspects of family are shown as the season goes on. Yu proves how far people are willing to go for their family when he throws himself into the fray. The commander of the humans proves what happens when one does not care about family. And the notion that family means more than shared blood rings throughout the season. The anime does not explore family on the vampire side, so the theme itself is not as strong as it could have been, but the theme is explored to some overall extent nonetheless. 
A less obvious theme is that of temptation. Vampires are tempted by blood, and humans are tempted by freedom. But the theme is more nuanced than that. Mika is tempted (indirectly) by Yu. Guren is tempted by his weapon. Yu is tempted by family. For many of the characters, the prospect of attaining their desires drives them forward. To be fair, the theme itself has no outright exploration, but, since the angel-and-demon backdrop exists, the theme of sin – temptation and greed go hand-in-hand – cannot be ignored. 
Does Mika, Guren, and some themes make up for the incredible amount of other problems the cast have? 
Barely. Just barely. 
The opening track of Nagoya has to be talked about first because of how poor it is. The tone, especially in the beginning, is overly optimistic. As such, it contrasts too much with the dreary mood that the rest of the anime steeps itself in. The song also does not do the vocalist justice. She is either forced to sing in a standard, almost conversational tone or forced to strain for specific notes. The only interesting part of the piece is the otherworldly sound-effect that seems as though it is produced by dropping a piece of metal in an icy cavern. But (obviously) that is not enough to make the OP even remotely worth listening to. 
The ending track, however, is a lot stronger. The beginning and middle adopt a captivating tone that is simultaneously chilling and beautiful. Varying the pace of the piece also furthers the song’s complexity which in turn furthers its strength. This time, the vocalist can flex her prowess, matching the song’s highs and lows, quicks and slows. The ending lyric is a bit silly – a “Trick Star” does not make much sense in the context of the anime let alone in real life – but, overall, the ED stands as a nice addition to Nagoya. 
The original soundtrack (expectedly) uses the same kind of music that the first half used. Most of the tracks are filled with drums, triumph, and ominous sound-effects, setting the atmosphere in a manner that befits the oft soldierly show. None of the tracks are particularly noteworthy, however, so they remain as simple additions rather than praiseworthy ones. 
Voice acting sees a similar fate. Saori Hayami’s feminine voice for Shinoa is still attractive to hear. Miyu Irino as Yu can be a bit grating when he starts pouting or yelling. And Kenichi Suzumura as Crowley coats his words with a childish lilt. The only above average performance comes from Kensho Ono as Mika for the struggle and pain one can hear in his voice. 
This type of show, where the characters are in danger of being killed off or maimed or otherwise needing help, usually gets me. I have to know if the characters are going to be all right because I just do not like being kept in the dark about their safety. And so, I found myself being pulled along by this one. 
But that was the only trait keeping me interested. I was not a fan of any of the characters. Yu was too annoying; Mika was even more so. Mitsuba, Kimizuki, and Yoichi were barely relevant. Guren was too much of a jerk, and the other vampires were either too arrogant to root for or too lame to take seriously. And since Shinoa lost a lot of her smug, she too was not as fun to follow. 
The action as well was uninteresting. None of the fights were cool or memorable. In fact, a lot of them blended together, especially when Yu and the humans almost never seemed to win or even succeed in any way. 
The anime’s comedic moments were sparse. The anime’s drama was not gripping. The anime’s romance could have been more pronounced. I was simply not entertained by the vast majority of what the anime set out to do. 
Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen has a slew of issues. The story does nothing, the characters are forgotten about, the animation is par for the course, the music likewise so, and, as a whole, it fails to entertain. Family may be forever, but, thankfully, this anime is not. 
Story: Terrible, so much nothing in the narrative it hurts 
Animation: Fine, nice background art, okay character designs, and about average actual animation 
Characters: Bad, themes on family and temptation surround Mika, Guren, and a spectacularly awful rest of the cast 
Sound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay OST, okay VA performances 
Enjoyment: Bad, the safety of the characters was the only enticing part 
Final Score: 3/10

    I just finished watching Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya which is the second season of the show. I said I would review it and here it is. So are my problems with the characters fixed? Does the second season improve all of the first season’s flaws? Let’s find out! 
(If you have not seen the show yet I suggest you do so or at least watch the first season since I will be talking about the ending of the first season) 
The second season picks up right at the end of the first season with Yuuichirou fully healed and everyone going back to business as usual. That is until they find out that there is corruption in the army and are sent to Nagoya to take down a huge vampire army. The majority of episodes in this season are about the battle in Nagoya (hence the name) and that is pretty much the main plot of the second season. I would go into more since there are a lot of twists and turns in this season but I am trying not to spoil the story since I highly suggest you watch this show for yourself, although as I said I will try not to spoil anything extremely major to the plot if you are here just to know if the second season is any good. And the answer is yes. The second season is a lot better than the first in terms of overall story progression since a lot of important stuff happens in this season opposed to the first and thanks to the setting and the main plot of this season there are a lot more epic fight scenes which was lacking in the first season. So overall in terms of story this season was a big improvement over the first, although like the first it does end on a cliff-hanger which I hope gets resolved since this is a show that deserves another season or a continuation of some sort. This story needs to be continued and while you could read the manga I still think it deserves another season since if you read the manga you wouldn’t get Hiroyuki Sawano’s epic soundtrack or the awesome voice acting backing it up.  
Thankfully this season gets rid of the main problems I had with the characters Yuuichirou and Mikaela. Yuuichirou is still a stubborn and generic shounen anime protagonist but still likable, and his goals aren’t mainly set on revenge but to also protect his new family and fight to defeat the vampires. Mikaela’s problems are fixed as well as he takes the role of a lone wolf, undercover protagonist rather than an anti-hero as he is still set on ‘saving’ Yuuichirou but is also not on the side of the vampires as, even though he is one, he still holds hatred for them which wasn’t really shown from him in the first season. Other than that all of my opinions on the other characters stay the same and not many new characters are introduced in this season which gives time for all of the old ones to be further fleshed out rather than focusing on some random new characters. Any of the new ones aren’t really worth talking about although they are still likable even if they don’t serve much to the plot. The only new character I will talk about is the show’s newest antagonist: Kureto Hiiragi. Kureto is one of the main heads of the Imperial Demon Army and also the main source for the corruption in the army. Throughout this series you will learn to hate Kureto as some of the stuff he does is pure evil, especially in the last two episodes. Although the show still never explains what the Four Horsemen of John are or where they came from. There is something that kind of explains it but it is a spoiler and it only happens in the last episode.  
First off, I forget to mention this in my review of season 1 but the first season has a good opening and ending and they were never songs I skipped. The same can’t be said for the second season however as the opening is boring, generic and not enjoyable to listen to and the ending is plain but better than the opening. The soundtrack remains the same and it is still as epic as ever, if even more as most of the songs I like from the soundtrack only play in the second season. And every time I hear the main theme play I just can’t help but smile at the epicness since it can make even a conversation about escaping between Yuuichirou and Mikaela sound like the most epic thing in the world. Definitely one of Hiroyuki Sawano’s best soundtracks and one that I will be listening to a lot down the line. My main problems still remain the same however as some of the sound effects sound muffled at times and the music to midway animation sequence transition is still pretty awkward. All of the voice actors return and the actors for the new characters are on par with the others. I would expect nothing less from a Funimation dub.  
My opinions on the animation are exactly the same as the first season since it is exactly the same. The colors really pop, the characters look really nice and Wit Studio shows that they can handle action scenes really well. My only complaint is that CGI is sometimes used, although it is never bad CGI it is still really noticeable and can break your focus during a scene when it appears. Although I don’t mind CGI in anime as long as it’s done well. The animation still remains to be one of the shows high points.  
Overall I thought that Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya was a definite improvement over the first season, mainly in terms of story and characters. It’s a show that deserves another season or a continuation of some sorts since it feels like it’s a story that you need to witness in anime form. I haven’t read the manga so I wouldn’t know how it compares but the awesomeness of this show, accompanied by Hiroyuki Sawano’s epic soundtrack is something that made me love this show so much and I couldn’t dream of witnessing this story without my favorite voice actors doing the voices or listening to the epic score in the background. That’s why I am happy to give Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya the rating that it deserves. 
Rating: Great  
(My rating system is explained if you check my profiles main page. I hope you liked the review and look forward to more in the future) 
Peace out, Anime fans!

    Ladies and Gentlemen this is a rare example of a perfectly mediocre anime. Flawlessly bland, exquisitely insipid, wholly vapid. Watching  Owari No Seraph is like eating air, there is simply no taste, good or bad.  
Owari No Seraph: Nagoya Kessen-hen is the uninspired continuation of an anime that should never have been made.  
Lets recap. A mysterious virus wipes out most of humanity and vampires come out of the woodwork to wage war on the surviving humans. Yu, our cliche shounen, hotheaded/immature/cocky/must-protect-everyone protagonist, has joined humanity's army to fight the vampires. He really really hates vampires for killing his childhood friends. He really really wants to protect his friends too. The second half starts after he unleashes his mysterious superpowers on the vampires about to kill his comrades.   
As with so many mediocre anime, the premise itself is neither novel nor self-evidently atrocious. 
The product is simply a sand-flavored cake. 
Slow pace/shitty action: 
There are a few identifiable things that contribute to ONS' mediocrity. The pacing is mind-numbingly slow. Most of the fight scenes in the show are related to training/testing of some sort. Learning to unlock your sword's potential, fighting your own weapon's demonic spirit, getting tested by the higher ups, learning to fight as a team, etc. The actual action scenes, what few there are, are usually pointless or indecisive. 
Convoluted storyline: 
The agendas of the humans and vampires are not well developed. The leadership and structure of the two factions are left nebulous and simple questions like why the two factions are fighting? why the vampires are so sadistic? What is a demon in relation to a vampire? etc are not explained. At times ONS try to draw clumsy moral parallels between the humans and vampires but it's just too messy and blurry to have any impact. 
Art: Mediocre 
Sound: Mediocre 
The characters are poorly fleshed out and easily forgettable. They will make predictable decisions then inexplicably decide to trust their mortal enemy for no reason.  
In the background of the almost completely absent character development is the homoerotic attraction between Mika and Yu. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how that fits in (no pun intended). I think the core problem is that both characters are just too underdeveloped for me to know where their bond is coming from. They are ""family"" but then Mika looks like he wants to bone Yu. Yu seems to act differently when he's around Mika. The male vampires are all pretty androgynous and the act of drinking blood is unsubtly sexualized. Then there's that strong pederasty vibe between Ferid and Mika... I dunno...whatever.  
To say that the characters are flat would be an understatement. They aren't even cardboard-flat. They are 100%, eco-friendly, RECYCLED cardboard-flat.  
Yu: Brash, hot headed, annoying as fuck. Where have we seen that before? Oh right, everywhere. He's a cookie-cutter shounen protagonist. He will charge into battle screaming at the drop of a hat without thinking. He has two objectives--kill vampires; protect friends. There's no growth throughout the series and he is exactly the same from beginning to end. 
Mika: Now a vampire. Struggling with his various 'urges'' you might say. I don't think it's a stretch to call his bloodlust an allegory for homosexuality but again, whatever. As a character his thought process is largely absent. Why is he siding with the vampires when they murdered his friends? If he is siding with the vampires why is he so hesitant about drinking blood/killing humans. If he is hesitant about killing humans why does he enable his friends to murder children and distrust humans so much? If being changed into a vampire has altered his thinking why does he still have such a boner for Yu? Why is he so wishy washy about everything?  
Everyone else: 
Too many half baked characters to keep track of. For such an vacuous anime you would think there would be plenty of room to develop the side characters but not really.  
Enjoyment: Meh 
Overall: Overall disappointing. The last few seasons of anime have been pretty weak so I finished this out of boredom. Watch only if you are really, really bored.

    My Owari no Seraph: Nagoya Kessen Hen review. 
Ratings: 
Story: Fair 6. 
Art: Good 7. 
Sound: Fair 6. 
Character: Very Good 8. 
Enjoyment: Fair 6. 
Overall: Good 7. 
Now that this sequel is over, why can I say about it? Well:  
Story (up) 
I gave it a fair, because it was still connected with the 1st season in an apocalyptic wasteland ( I just exaggerated it) where vampires wanna rule and humans have to survive, but in its general context, the story simply rely on the ""Betrayal"" theme , where one would think knows who bad and the good were, but as it turns out it wasn't that black and white. In this sequel, it wasn't surprising  that in any show with an apocalyptic theme, it would always have an open ending. 
Art (up) 
Well what can I say, it's the usual quintessential for any anime or manga to overdress the characters, it's like making them go to a formal gathering in a bikini, then again, this anime didn't rely on the fanservice to sell, that would prompt them preves to play with their joystick. 
Sound (up) 
I don't have any comment as to the seiyus who did the character's voices, and I don't have any liking for both the opening and closing themes. I think that's ""Fair"" enough. 
Character (up) 
I've said before, in this anime the distinction between black and white isn't that obvious, in fact this anime has kept us audience guessing as to how them characters would turn up, thought the main protagonist  Yuuichirou  Hyakuya is the quintessential character who should be the most powerful one the anime wasn't solely focus on him, rather it was equally divided amogst the characters, but the most profound where Guren, Mika, Ferid, Cowley and Kureto, they basically defined treachery in their own order and Shinoa, Kimizuki, Mitsuba, Yoichi and Mikoto defines survival in their own way  as soon as they themselves got caught in a situation where they can no longer trust even their own side, which provides for a ""Very Good"" climax and ending for this anime. 
Overall (up) 
I suppose, I could have given this anime's overall an 8, but since it ended with an open ending with no assurance of a season 3 (or will it), I just ranked it a 7, which IMAO would be ""Good"" enough............ 
PEACE and Happy New Year

    * Hi there! This is my first review, so bear with me if it's badly written or judged. Constructive feedback is welcomed. * 
Did you enjoy Seraph of the End (Owari no Seraph) Season 1? Then you'll probably enjoy this sequel. Personally, I don't like Seraph of the End as a whole, but the show has a few merits that keep it from being unbearable to watch. 
NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST SEASON. 
From what we've seen so far, the animation is generally a lot more realistic and fluid than the first season's. In the first season, the animation was quite rigid and unrealistic, barely showing any kind of fluidity at all (e.g when Guren goes flying through the air in ep.10) and episodes would often use cheap ""action lines"" as a means to show multiple people fighting.   
Honestly, the soundtrack isn't anything special, it works very well when it needs to but otherwise the sound is above average. The opening music is nice. 
I think the art style of this show is beautifully done. Some might not like the hazy, painted and generally greyish background style (which really shows during scenes set outside) but I think it really captures the story's wasteland/apocalypse setting. These backgrounds always compliment what is being animated. The same can be said for the character and weapon designs, which also suit the story very well. 
The story continues where we left off, and is based on the battle at Nagoya. The actual plot, so far, as boring, stale, and as shounen as the first season, so don't expect much development there. There are, however, more action scenes, which is what this show does a lot better than the first season. The second season, more so than the first, loves to shove themes of 'family' down your throat every single episode. I'd appreciate these themes if they were implemented with even a bit of subtlety, and would let the viewer make a personal connection rather than having it constantly spoon-fed to them, but instead these 'familial themes' get in the way of enjoyment. To its merit, the second season's premise is quite promising and interesting so far, and has a lot of potential to turn into something engaging. 
What saved the show from being unwatchable for me were the moments based entirely on character interactions, episodes where the whole gang would just talk to each other and have a fun time. Yes, all of the characters are modelled off of common shounen stereotypes   but that doesn't mean they aren't entertaining. The second season shows us how the characters have developed from the annoying and arrogant kids they were in the first season and are becoming slightly more mentally mature. If you don't like shounen main characters and common character types (e.g tsundere) which all receive below-standard development then you probably won't enjoy Seraph of the End's characters. 
Seraph of the End's second season is quite enjoyable for fans of the series but to the people like me who didn't really find the show to be to their liking, skip this continuation. The only reason I'm not dropping the series is because of its (shounen, but) enjoyable characters, great art style, and okay animation. 
Thanks for reading!

    Owari no Seraph is back. Initially, I was disappointed with the first season. With heavy amounts of exposition and lack of charisma for quite a bit of episodes, my expectations going into the sequel wasn’t high. However, season 2 turned out to be pleasantly different. No, I wasn’t expecting this to be a significant improvement but it does set its foot a bit further than mediocrity. 
Branded as a sequel, it’s absolutely imperative to be familiar with the first season to get the full experience. As the title implies, the majority of the second season takes place in Nagoya, a city on the surface that is also home to noble vampires. Originally, it was actually home to humans until the Apocalypse. What is the Apocalypse? For a brief recap, it’s pretty much when a lethal epidemic wiped out a major part of humanity years before the start of the show. From this event, vampires became the rulers and treats human like livestock while also keeping some human children alive for their own purpose. One of these children named Yuichiro Hyakuya managed to escape and was taken in by the Japanese Imperial Demon Army, a group of resistance who plans to liberate themselves from the vampires’ rule. Flash forward to present day and we got a resistance group fighting not for pride or liberty. But for survival. 
Adapted from the manga, the second season is actually quite faithful or at least captures the magic of the story especially in the first 10 episodes. The first season had a ridiculous amount of info dump and exposition, so much with the buildup and to the point that it became distracting. Luckily, this sequel is more about the action and the execution. A few concepts in this season deals with how humans desperately fight for survival in the face of unimaginable circumstances, the higher-ups of the Japanese Imperial Army taking a keen interest in Yu, and Yu’s own personal goal to make Mika into a normal human again after realizing that he has turned into a vampire; the very thing he loathes. A lot of the episodes also deals with interpersonal problems and how certain characters such as Shinoa bears responsibility for herself and others. In the face of danger, characters make decisions that gambles on life and death. Some even defy orders for their own personal reasons.  
As such, expect the sequel to bulk emotional drama as well. The latter half of the show will easily get the viewers to recognize how dangerous the vampire Nobles can be. Death is reality and the humans realizes that whole earthly. While there is a lot of battle on the frontlines, the show also seems to enforce human drama. The most prominent would be the relationship between Yu and Mika. The latter is no longer human while Yu tries to restore him back to normal. Their conversation unites them with both delightful and painful memories of the past. Just do note that there’s a bit of feeling of subtle BL that fans likes to play their minds with in one of these episodes. While the show isn’t actually a BL, it’s easy to fantasize after seeing the deep chemistry between Yu and Mika.  
Other characters in the series also makes an impact of various degrees. Shinoa’s character is much more serious as she has a lot of burden on her shoulders. Meanwhile, Guren shows what his comrades means to him when faced against unprecedented odds on the frontlines. What’s much more interesting though is the presence of the Hiragi family. Kureto, the heir of the family’s current heir, is a character that is a bit different from his comrades. With a cold personality and strong emphasis to accomplish any task at whatever the cost, he also often demands respects from others. To me, he is like the anti-thesis of the main characters. Although he is fighting for the good of mankind, his ways of doing so often puts odds against his own comrades. One could even speculate that he is a manipulative individual as he assigns Guren’s group into near impossible missions. Speaking of family, it still remains a main theme throughout the second season. Besides Yu and Mika, the Moon Demon Company still has a prominent presence. Yu treats it like his own family and often seeks to protect them. Even if this takes toll on his own body and spirit, Yu is selfless in nature. Obviously, this also translates into his desire to turn Mika back to what he was before – a human. The way the sequel is directed improves as each episode adds more and more to the main themes and concepts. Even the storytelling gets more interesting with the developments despite some pacing issues and omitting some parts of the manga. On the negative side, the antagonists of the show still remains dense and stereotypical. Characters like Crowley hardly gets any characterization while most of the fights against the strongest vampires lacks excitement. (most of them are more like one sided fights). Furthermore, Kuel continuously hides secrets from others and we don’t get the chance to know her true purpose. I suppose Mika is more like an anti-hero in this season although his actions are questionable with his vampire nature. But in retrospect, the antagonists aren’t appealing either in character or role. 
Wit Studio adapts the sequel although the artwork hardly improved. The character designs still looks essentially the same as they did for the previous season although I like the way the Hiiragi family members are designed. Kureto in particular expresses a ruthless nature that is decorated quite well. In addition, most of the demons has a credible design to induce fear. We also get the introduction of some new noble family members, antagonists that looks even more menacing than before. The battles they participates in are some of the main highlights of the sequel as camera angles and action scenes features them quite well. Match that with the stereo soundtrack and we got quite a season. The OP and ED theme songs also conveys what the show is capable of that gives off more of its atmospheric setting – a battlefield with nothing but potential for destruction and chaos.  
After taking a breath in and out, I think this second season is an improvement of the previous. It capitalized the main story’s purpose while delivering memorable fights and expressing a variety of emotions. While the technical features still generally remained the same, the show is easily watchable for those looking into some stylistic action. I can’t say for sure that the sequel will be a pleasurable experience for everyone though. It still omits manga material at some parts and can seem a bit too serious for its own good. One particular episode with Yu and Mika in the second half of the show can be uncomfortable to watch for some people. And also, I feel like they stuffed a lot into the finale, perhaps too much and leaves too open. But for all its downsides, the battle in Nagoya will be one to remember.

    Micro review: 
The characters are shallow but the story is interesting. 
Do not watch this anime if you don't like waiting for answers to plot points. Do not watch this if you only plan to watch a few at a time. 
This anime requires a binge session to finish it as it can get tedious, but it is (kinda) worth it. 
Story: 5 
Sound: 7 
Characters: 2  
Enjoyment: 5 
I have now finished this anime and as such my review has changed, slightly. 
I will leave my old review up as I still agree with it as i wrote it, 9 episodes in. Go to the bottom for full season review. 
Up to episode 9: 
[Such a waste of an intriguing plot idea and character (Mika) 
The first season was not the best, I will admit. Yet I felt that the story had promise and Mika was way underdeveloped. 
The second season is everything that is wrong with the first on steroids, all beefed up and loud. One dimensional characters that are just the tropes of typical animes. No character development or really plot progression. 
All that happens could be summed up in a fraction of the time if there were not purely random and unexplained scenes mixed with boring drawn out flashbacks. The only thing that kept me watching was the story, and I found out that it is really not all that complex after reading a summery.  
The characters are stuck in a time paradox. One where any actual character development is stuck and all that they can do is spout the same exact lines over and over.  
Art and sound are good. Yet, as hard as you try to dress up a pile of trash to make it look fabulous, it's still garbage.  
Only watch if you need anything to watch and have no better options to binge.  
If the story is grabbing you then look it up online] 
Full season: 
On a whim I decided to finish this anime late one night, and I am glad I did. Kinda. It is still not the best anime by any shot but I can kinda see it going somewhere next season, so I hold out hope there.  
The main issue with it is that it is trying to be the next big hit anime *cough (Attack On Titan) cough*, but FAILS hard. It has a great story, I knew this from the start; this was why I even continued to watch it and why I finished it. Too bad the characters and writers let the story down.  
There are simply too many mysteries in the story and more keep coming the longer you watch. With no answers to solve the past questions you just end up lost in what is going on always. Characters motivations are there, but we have not got any idea what they are.  
This is the shows biggest failing, the writers are writing in too many character traits without fleshing out the others added before. This leaves you with a confusing mess of a ""family"" of characters whose motivations are one dimensional and come off as just lame.  
Read the manga if you have the itch for answers that I have after finishing. Maybe it is the better read, or at least it is more complete at this point.

    Generic: such a simple word, yet one that can also encapsulate a great deal of information with its utterance. Simply attach it to the title of a show and it works as a description without any need for further elaboration. Just say ""it's generic"" and a picture is immediately imprinted onto the minds of the audience as to what is to be expected. It's even better saying it out loud, follow after me and let's say it together: 
""Owari no Seraph is generic!"" 
Now doesn't that just roll off the tongue with so much ease? Fits like a glove doesn't it? It's like the word itself was tailor-made for this show. And perhaps that word is all that's needed to sum up this series.  
There's really no change when it comes to this ill-conceived hogwash of clichés and overused tropes. It's still a poor man's version of better shounen stories, it's still subpar in quality, and it's still an intoxicating pile of throw-away excerpts from better-established premises and ideas. Owari no Seraph is the ""How to make a Basic Shounen for Dummies"" in visual format. If 1st season didn't hammer that point in, then this season surely made sure to get the job done. But I guess there is one noticeable change worth noting, and that's that the show somehow manages to get worse. Through the magic of fujoshi bait, God awful writing and the power of friendship, this anime becomes a firework display of stupidity rarely achieved by many. It pushes forward into the throw-away abyss at breakneck speeds. And in its own way, it succeeds. It has proven that when you really try hard enough, when you really push long enough, and when you really care enough, you can enter even denser shounen bullshit territory. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you ""Generic: the anime."" 
Picking up from where we left off, we follow our protagonist MustProtectMyFamily-kun and the squadron of vampire slayers, as they gear up for an impending all-out battle with the vampires, in what is to be an attempt to regain control of Earth for the sake of humanity's survival. And while all this is going on, in the background, there's an even more sinister plan being conjured up by ImTheObviousBadGuy-sama and his cohorts.  
Now the setup for this season isn't all that bad, in fact, it's a traditional one that, if done right, can be quite rewarding to watch unfold. It's the classic clash of ideals, where opposition reaches a breaking point of unreachable compromise. The end all be all fight where the stakes are set on the highest pedestal. A Zero-sum dice roll, where only one side can walk away rewarded. These are the kind of stories that litter literature, cinema and TV on constant rotation, but despite that, can still offer up the same thrills and chair-gripping engagement expected from the best of them. But even when considering the long shelf-life that these kinds of stories offer, if it's poorly written, no amount of the garnishing and repacking can be done to salvage it. And to no one's surprise, Owari no Seraph isn't going to be a show that defies that unspoken rule.  
You see, the problem with Seraph isn't the premise or idea, but rather the piss poor execution of it. The show just doesn't seem to have the proper comprehension of what is needed for it to make this kind of story work. Its ineptitude runs deep into the core foundation of the show, from the garish narrative decisions to the downright terrible plot conveniences tossed in to bail itself out of a tight squeeze. Every turn and corner lead into another questionable writing decision that really exposes the lack of foresight on the part of the creator, and improper planning on the part of the scriptwriters. Throughout the show's run-time, this leads to numerous situations where our characters come face to face with death, only to have a last-minute dues ex machina tossed in to fish them out of troubled water. And this doesn't just happen a few times, it happens in an endless cycle, most notably with our main protagonist MustProtectMyFamily-kun, who inexplicably survives more shit than even what's possible with the aid of basic plot armor. It's like he himself becomes the embodiment plot armor, to the point where his existence is met with guaranteed immunity, regardless of consequence. This creates some of the most uninspired character struggle imaginable. There is zero tension to a story that goes out of its way to perform back flips around its lead.  
But this isn't only limited to him, almost everyone that's given a name and a back-story is automatically in the safe-zone, even if they're stabbed through vital organs. I can't properly explain this without taking a special mention of the show's ending. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, just pay attention to the numerous times where our main characters not only live through death marker injuries but also walk it off like it wasn't that big of a deal, it's quite laughable. The only ones 'biting the bullet' are characters that are clearly introduced for the sake of dying a few episodes later. The moment they're introduced, a death flag is planted smack dab on their forehead. It's an old trick that wasn't good in other stories and isn't good here either.  
But Owari no Seraph S2 isn't all bad, if anything, there was a noticeable improvement in its art and animation. The fights carry more weight behind it (non-figuratively speaking), the character models remained far more consistent from frame to frame, and the issue regarding the flat backgrounds are better worked around. It's a more palatable experience overall, and that, at the very least, deserves some credit. Also, the color choices seemed better implemented. For example, the reds (burgundy to be more specific) and greens were far more eye-catching than the often acid washed look of the 1st season. It wasn't that big of a change but it was enough to be noticed on a panel to panel comparison.  
As far as the soundtrack goes, most of the content from season one finds itself worked back into this season. If you liked S1's music score then S2 should suffice. However, the opening wasn't as instantaneous as the first. It feels more commonplace in comparison to the harmonious balance found between the vocals and instruments of the 1st season's musical number. Not a bad opening per se, just not as catchy as bellowing out ""I'LL BE THERE, HOLD ON, THEY'LL CHANGE US SOMEHOW, SO WHERE ARE YOU NOWWW?"", but it still gets the job done in its own way. Not singing in the shower level, but hey, music is subjective, so that depends entirely on the listener. 
Owari no Seraph's 2nd season does improve a few aspects that 1st season was lacking but it also implemented things that were far worse as well. It took one step forward only to take two steps back. It's not the most aggravating title to watch but at the same time, it doesn't have a reason to exist (outside of Wit Studio milking a fanbase it helped establish).  
Enjoyment: 5/10 
Despite the more noticeable issues this season had in comparison to the 1st, I still can't bring myself to hate this franchise. It's really just a soulless product that comes and goes without registering any sort of response from me. The fights were better put-together but the narrative was more stupid. The animation was more eye-catching but the content being animated was dumb. In a way, it just balanced itself out. A series that's forever just ""ok"" in my head. 
Overall: 3.5/10 
Owari no Seraph is a show that's either passable or outright rejected betting on one factor, and that's personal experience. Like I've stated in my season one review, this anime serves as a gateway title to help you get a little insight into the medium's norm and season two only furthers that trend. But where the line is drawn is that factor, that personal experience. If you've been an active follower of anime for an extended period of time, you've undoubtedly seen numerous of titles that play out in the exact same order to what Owari offers. And from that vast selection, you've probably seen it play out far better as well. So with that in mind, this anime isn't made for long time anime viewers, it's made for the bright-eyed newcomers who haven't consumed enough of these fast food titles to grow sick of them yet. Owari no Seraph can serve as a title to get others into the medium, but as far as those already steadfast in it, I cannot in good conscience recommend this John Smith: serial number 28927.

    Just watched season two close.  I google'd to make sure I wasn't missing any more eps, and noticed there may be a 13-15 arc.  Came here to check out news on it.  Seems not released, but glanced the reviews.  The ones on display are so sycophantic I felt I need to write my own. 
Compare it to this, compare it to that, not happy about this, not happy about that.  Troglodytes believing they are wine connoisseurs in a world where everyone drinks wine.   
I've enjoyed the show, first season was excellent, pacing on second was slower, but when you have a story to tell, its how it is, and season 2 close has me chomping at the bit for more of this world.  It has so much to give, and i will feel disappointed if the story does not continue.

    Story (7/10) - These two 'specials' are nothing more than the final two episodes of To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd. I feel bad for the fans of Darkness 2nd when this was still airing, having to wait to see how the series ended, anime-wise. 
Art (8/10) - The only thing I feel like I can comment on is Yami's new appearance. 
Character (8/10) - The more surprising thing than Yami's new appearance is her personality, but then you remember that this is To LOVE-Ru. 
Enjoyment (7/10) - This felt like more satisfying ending than the cliffhanger Darkness 2nd left us with. 
Overall (7.4/10) - Much like the anime these 'specials' are based off, it is sad to know that this is the end of the To LOVE-Ru anime series. Oh well, now I can read the Manga to see what I missed, and how it ends!

    After watching the first 12 episodes, I knew there had to be more; these two special episodes conclude this season's plot. 
In lieu of an in-depth review, I'll try to be brief as it's only two episodes. 
It continues where it left off and finishes strong. My only issue with the plot is Nemesis; she's a likable character, but the writer gave her such an uninspired goal. And even if she succeeds, I'm not sure what that exactly does for her. But maybe it isn't fair to criticize her intentions because we still don't seem to know much about her.  
Yami's transformed appearance, in my opinion, is quite beautiful. Her face and expressions, in the final minutes of the last episode, are drawn really well. Furthermore, the action sequences are animated exceptionally well. 
The opening is great, and the ending is even better, but unfortunately, the BGM wasn't very memorable. Voice acting was amazing as always, especially Yami's voice actor this season; she does three different character voices (Yami, Yami Transformed, and Tear). 
As one would expect after watching episode 12, these final two episodes focus on Yami's character. Moreover, Rito's actions, at this season's climax, are something to look forward to as well. Lala changes too, but I can't say anything more without spoiling it. 
What can I say? I'm a huge fan of the show. Ultimately, if you're looking for closure, you'll find it in these last two episodes.  
Overall: 10

    Going into this spin off I expected something similar to THE IDOLM@STER's Puchim@s! Instead I got something pretty different. 
The show has a lot of meta humor and pokes fun of the flaws many viewers had complained about in the past. 
Story: It's a short comedy series so there's not much story. 
Art: Typical low quality art for the kind of spin off it is. 
Sound: There's only one song, the ending theme, but it's pretty catchy and I'll have it stuck in my head far after this review. 
Enjoyment: I found the humor very enjoyable as someone who likes meta humor. 
Overall: For anyone who saw the original series or just someone who likes meta humor I'd say it's worth a watch. It's about 40 minutes in total. The ending changes a bit each episode so don't skip it.

    well... I don't have many words for this movie but I have to write a minimum of words so I'll try my best  
the description of the movie says that she is worried about what the boy thinks of her but I didn't get the feeling that was true it was more like she was discussed by the fact that she had animals as students and I have to be fair if that would to be happen to me I wouldn't feel so sure either. 
the description also says that she was living in the countryside but I didn't see any of that. when someone says countryside I think of farmers what I saw was just a random school in some on known place with animals and one human kid and a human teacher  
I like the idea of the story line but I think to really understand the story line it should have been a longer movie and they should go more in detail like the girl couldn't talk to the boy and the animals because she was to shy or afraid but then somewhere in the movie the girl should have some kind of backstory that she would tell the boy and the animals and then they would understand her and become friends and live happily ever after something like that but not like this because there is totally no bonding or whatsoever  
story 1 
because it isn't clear it could be an amazing movie if it would be... yeah I don't know... more! 
art: 7 
the animation is good I don't have any complaints about that it is true that there are anime movies/series who have better art but this is not something you would rate as bad 
sound: 10 
I don't know what this is... the background sounds were good and the music fits good with the scene so I have no complaints 
character 1: 
I like it when you get to know the (main) characters in an anime like even though it is a drawing the character can feel for the watcher like a real person if you get too know the character, if you get to know the feelings of the character but with this movie I don't even know who the fuck these people are  
enjoyment: 1 
because the movie was rather fast over and because I didn't get to know the characters there wasn't really much enjoyment in for me but I think the enjoyment is for everyone different because I for example really like One Piece or Detective Conan (you should really watch these series they are like airing for twenty years already the story lines are really good) but a friend of mine hates them so yeah its probably different for everyone 
overall: 6 
my overall score is pretty high for all the complaints I gave but I think that the story line could be really good if the movie were longer and I think it's not fair to give a bad grade for the movie because you can see that there has been put a lot of time and effort in the making of this movie  
haha... I said I didn't have much words for this rating but in the end there were quite a lot  
I hope this is helpful for all of you otaku's out there and that if you watch the movie that you will in the end realize why I said all of this about the movie you don't need to have the same thought as me but I hope you do respect and understand my opinion    
p.s. become friends with me we can share secret otaku information with each other

    There isn't much to this movie because it's only 22 minutes long but it's pretty good for a short relaxing film to pass time. 
Story - 7/10: 
They story was pretty basic, girl meets famous wind god, goes away and leaves clues about what she did behind. 
Art - 9/10: 
The art style is actually more to my preference than say the mainstream art style these days e.g. the art style of AssClass/Yuri on Ice. It gives a feeling of oldness (idk if that makes sense) and just makes the film itself more enjoyable. 
Sound - 9/10:  
Can't really say much about this aside from it matches the overall story very well. 
Character - 7/10:   
There isn't much on the development but the producers kind of left us on a cliff hanger with the girl and boy's relationship. It would've been better to either make a sequel developing the characters further or simply making their relationship as a come and go one instead of having the girl seem like she doesn't want to go back to the city after staying at the boy's house OR making the girl refuse the offer to go back to the city and instead stay with her new friends. 
Enjoyment - 9/10: 
Even though it was short. I actually quite liked the episode simply because I don't have to work my brain so hard after watching 10 different airing anime at the same time and figuring out all the relationships and characters of each. 
Overall, I'd give it an 8/10 and I'd definitely recommend this to people who just want to chill ◕ω◕

    Where do I even begin? I like everything about it >.< 
This movie was like a breath of fresh air. You watch it and find yourself lost in the simplicity of it. Everything about it whispers serenity and calmness.  
Story - 9  
It started with a boy seeming to while away the minutes before the start of the class by rocking himself in his chair. From here on, the background music was introduced and it sets the tone of the story and how his classmates (who were yep surprise surprise--animals) started talking about a magical being they call Matasaburou---child of the Wind God. No one can really validate his existence and he's more like an urban legend than an actual entity. Then came in the teacher with a transfer student who happened to be a human girl.  
No developments here whatsoever (because this is NOT a series) but like all stories, or for this matter, films, there is a conflict and climax. I don't want to spoil so let me just say that like the rest of the film, they were not so complicated but match the story very well.  
Okay, since it has Kaze in its title, there ought to be whooshing and blowing sounds here and there and yep, it didn't disappoint. Since the setting is in the countryside, there are more trees, more nature and more wind in here and the sound they make in the film seem real. Try to close your eyes for a sec and just listen to the music and it will tell you what I'm talking about. The story coupled with the background music will put you in a comforting mood that would make you not want to do anything but relax, savor it and enjoy it.  
Character - 10 
The characters were so cute let me just say! All adults (except for one) were humans in this film but most of them were animals. It's funny how they have animals in class and they speak and talk like humans too, welcoming the new girl on her first day. Being a girl hailing from the city though, she seemed not used to the company of animals and was rather aloof and weirded out by her ""classmates"". She has a worm for a classmate! I am deathly afraid of worms or any small crawling insects but the worm in the film was soooo cute hahaha you have to see it for yourself. And there's a tsundere moment for their rabbit classmate :3 super cute :3 :3 
Art - 10 
Oh gosh. The art is refreshing. It reminds me so much of The Tale of Princess Kaguya except that one has milder tones whereas the art outline for Kaze is more pronounced. I like it, like how the characters were made alive by the illustrator. The colors were great too. Very soothing to the eyes. Everything is soft and subtle.  
Overall - 10/10 
I enjoyed it so much and I like how it ended. It actually leaves the audience with a sense of having to think about how they want it to end. Did the girl just leave for the day and will come back after a few days or did she leave for good? It can be interpreted either way and even though there is a talk of leaving, it doesn't make you feel empty afterwards. To be honest, I kept thinking about the cute worm and tsun rabbit at this point.  
So, if you are going to ask the question, 'Should I watch this anime?"" My answer would be a resounding Yes. :) Have fun!

    Kaze no Matasaburou was one of 2016's young animator training projects. We've looked at these training projects before with 2014's Harmonie & 2015's Aki no Kanade. This one is a bit of a weird example because both of those projects had recognisable studios backing them. This one has the studio listed as Buemon. And, as far as I can tell, they just help other studios with CG scenes sometimes.  
Basically, our story involves a girl moving out to the country where her classroom only has one other human and a bunch of animals. She meets a literal wind God and picks up a very special feather. Probably the one he uses for kinky foot stuff. 
The biggest issue with the story telling is that the world building is kind of awkward. The idea of humans going to school with various creatures is a good one for a children's film, but then they throw in things that don't make a lot of sense. Our heroine, Takada, for example, seems startled by the fact that her class has talking animals in it and freaks out when a friendly worm tries to say hi. Which doesn't make a lot of sense in a world where talking animals is just an ordinary occurrence. 
I also question how the carnivorous animals like cats and bears can get along with prey animals. Does the deer hold a grudge over the time the bear's family ate her dad, or is that just an expected circumstance? But this is a children's film so I can let that part slide. 
I will say that the film does have a certain charm to it. It's ultimately an entertaining little story about a girl adjusting to a new school and having a magical experience in the process.  
This is one of those kid's works where the characters are completely basic. Which isn't an inherently bad thing, but it does mean the appeal is pretty limited. The best I can say for them is that some of their interactions are pretty endearing.  
The art style is interesting. It looks a bit like an animated picture book. Which I can give them credit for. It's a pretty good style for this type of story even if it doesn't look amazing.  
Sound:  
The acting and music are both passable. This is one of those cases where the simplicity of the characters results in the actors not having anything to really work with. So, they do a decent job but it's not all that good. The music is pretty forgettable. It's not bad, but not good either. It just doesn't leave an impression.  
Ho-yay: 
There is none to be found. Which makes sense since only two students share a species and they aren't the same gender.  
Have characters react in a way that's more genuine to the world. Being startled by talking animals doesn't work in a world where that's normal. Nor does being scared of worms when worms are just ordinary citizens.  
Give Takada more to do with her magic feather. We only get to see her use this thing once to dispel some fog. I get that it's a very short film, but you could work something else out.  
Give a reason for Takada to leave the feather. In the end, she leaves to return to the city and abandons the feather. Why would you leave behind a magic feather? I get that it only summons gusts of wind, but still. 
Kaze no Matasaburou is okay. It's not really good, but it was entertaining enough for a quick viewing. If you have a youngster to entertain for twenty minutes or you're just curious, go ahead and give it a watch. I give it a 6/10.

There is not thing so much thing to make your enjoyment spoil though you can bypass Story section for caution. 
Story (7) : Kaze no Matasaburou is a short movie. It's a Fantasy movie of 22 minute. There's not much story to tell about. Story reveal around about a boy who seems bored with his daily life and girl who came from city to countryside .She found his life quite awkward as she has to study with animals. And then after finding a power by accidentally when she was falling in love with countryside she has to move on to city again.

Character (6) : I will pass this section as it not important for this movie 
Enjoyment (8) : If you used to like relaxing and peaceful movie you will enjoy it for sure. It was enjoyable for me at least.

    (Updated 12/31) 
For anyone who's seen the other works of Studio 3Hz, you'd know that they created Sora no Method, which spiked about a 6.7/10 on MyAnimeList, and continues to be criticized for one of the worst plot holes seen in anime. On top of Sora no Method, Dimension W, a Sci-Fi Seinen that got pretty popular spiked about 7.3/10 on MyAnimeList. Studio 3Hz didn't do Dimension W on their own, the did it in part with the studio Orange, and besides Sora no Method, there seemed to be no original, redeeming work that could make a name for this studio. 
Fall 2016 rolls around, and with the releases of several new fan favorites and a few new sequels to popular anime, Flip Flappers was one of the releases. Just like every season, there's seemingly one or two anime that get pushed aside and not really mentioned, and Flip Flappers is one of those anime. Does it deserve it? Absolutely not.  
Flip Flappers is something totally different, a breath of fresh air in terms of animation, character, music, story, and setting. Every time I watched an episode of Flip Flappers, I felt happy, relaxed, and desperate to watch the next episode. It starts early with a hook, and it definitely keeps you reeled in. 
Studio 3Hz really blew it out of the water with this fun, colorful, beautiful, and enjoyable anime with extremely likable characters, both protagonist and antagonist and even background characters who are hardly mentioned. 
Story - 8  
Flip Flappers has a concept I've never seen portrayed in anime. The collection of ""fragments"" throughout the setting of Pure Illusion is both relaxing and will keep you on the edge of your seat to see what happens. The setting Studio 3Hz set for Flip Flappers is gorgeous and so flexible, so full of adventure and molds the story into something that's beautiful, enjoyable, and allows viewers to feel like they're a part of the world Flip Flappers portrays. 
However, what keeps the story from the perfect 10 is that in the first 4-5 episodes, the story seems scattered and spotty. The execution of the story is weak, but eventually the hook that starts in the second episode with more story in Pure Illusion makes the story eventually progress like it should. The first few episodes seem to lack follow a plot that progresses later into the anime, it's more to show us, the viewers, the world of Pure Illusion, and the inhabitants and natives of Pure Illusion. 
If the story in the beginning would've started off with the story of Cocona's confusion about her life, and about her parents, and how she's started going to Pure Illusion after meeting Papika, then this score would be much higher. 
Flip Flappers has gorgeous animation and character and setting design that Studio 3Hz has never indulged in. To quote my friend, it has that ""Trigger"" feel to it. The feeling that reminds you of Kill la Kill or Uchuu Patrol Luluco. The animation is smooth, the setting of Pure Illusion is gorgeously portrayed and makes you want to pause so you don't miss a single thing it shows you. Even when the setting isn't in Pure Illusion, the art is still bright and colorful.  
Even when the ambience on the animation and color is turned down to a darker scale, like in some parts of Pure Illusion or at night time, it still pops out and looks gorgeous. The art is extraordinary. 
Personally my favorite part of the show is the sound and music. I'll be honest to tell you that the opening song and ending song are probably on my top favorite anime songs of all time. The music is just the right amount of hype to get the viewers excited for the episode that follows, and the ending song is peaceful and has the viewers on their toes desperate for the next episode, so they can experience the beautiful atmosphere this anime create. 
The sound for the battles that happen are realistic, but also add to the added Sci-Fi genre Flip Flappers have, giving it that ""futuristic"" feel. That's what I love most about this anime - it's Sci-Fi, but it's not a Sci-Fi that's ruined with over-the-top cliches, especially in terms of the sound. The ambience and sound in Pure Illusion just hypes up the gorgeous setting more and more. 
Character - 9  
The characters in Flip Flappers are unique and all differentiate from one another. We have Cocona, who later in the anime has more of an important role than the beginning, but is portrayed at first as an idolized honors student. Papika is a mixture of our comic relief, but is also Cocona's loyal, cute, and enjoyable partner. Together, these two take adventure into Pure Illusion, where we meet Yayaka, who is partnered with Yuyu and Toto. Yayaka, Yuyu and Toto prove to be interesting characters and great antagonists for our heroes Cocona and Papika. 
With Pure Illusion being used in the first few episodes just to show off how this universe and world work, we are given a variety of unique and amazing characters that do not come back after the episode they're premiered in. Characters like Welwitschia would be amazing to see work alongside Yayaka, Yuyu and Toto, but is seemingly removed right after her appearance. Uexküll, Cocona's pet rabbit, is given a good chunk of screen time in the beginning and is seemingly shown to maybe have an impact in the show, but never actually does a lot. And the addition of TT-392, or Buu-chan could've been done so much better. Buu-chan seems to have a lot of potential, but is easily manipulated and converts to whatever female antagonist is thrown at us, and seems to be more of a hinderance than a partner to Cocona and Papika. 
Enjoyment - 10  
As I've continually mentioned in my review, the anime's hook starts right when we're introduced to Cocona's and Papika's delve into the wonderful and gorgeous world of Pure Illusion. The anime is extremely enjoyable and makes you want to delve into the same adventures of Cocona and Papika (Studio 3Hz, Flip Flappers game pleaseee?) Every Thursday watching this anime, I was so excited for the newest episodes to come out that I would wait at the 30 minute mark before they came onto Crunchyroll just to watch them right then and there.  
This show is extremely fun and enjoyable, and it's definitely my pick for my absolute favorite for Fall 2016. 
Overall - 9.4/10 (rounded down to 9/10) 
I could not recommend this anime more. It's so fun and so stunning, Studio 3Hz really blew it out of the water with this.  
WATCH. THIS. ANIME!

    Flip Flappers feels like a show influenced by Madoka Magica, and you would definitely enjoy it if you loved Madoka. It's a magical girl show that goes in unexpected directions, with a platonic romance at its center. 
The thing that makes Flip Flappers enjoyable no matter your preference in anime is its aesthetic. It's a beautiful-looking, smoothly-animated show with lots of exciting action scenes. The characters visit various fantastical parallel worlds, and the art direction really shines through here. Every episode is a visual feast, even indulging in spoofs of genres like horror or mecha. The main cast's voice acting is great, not so much in the sense that it transmits incredible emotion, but rather in that it really feels like they embody their characters. The quality of sound design in general complements this. 
So Flip Flappers is a wonderfully-produced show from a relatively unknown studio, which is already a win and should have won them a bigger audience. Aside from the unseemly amount of shameless fanservice in a show about middle-school girls, my only real problem with Flip Flappers is its story. It's not that it doesn't make sense--it does, but you have to be willing to yield to the show's dream-logic a bit. What really bothers me is that the story doesn't proceed in an organic way at all. Characters simply go along with unusual situations without asking questions; important revelations fall flat because characters aren't given the time to react to them. The story doesn't really begin to take shape until the second half of the series, and by then I think there wasn't enough time to get through the whole thing. From then on, the plot becomes really predictable and secondary to the fantastic visuals. 
Still, Flip Flappers has inherently likable characters populating an amazing world, and it should at least entertain just about anyone who likes anime. The show also has a sense of humor about itself; the preview for the final episode tricks viewers into believing that they ran out of animation budget and it's going to be an audio-only, Evangelion-style affair. It's a very fun show, definitely more fun than Madoka in its first episodes. It just becomes a little underwhelming towards the end.

I rarely, if ever, flop over. 
That’s thanks to my favorite chair at home. Its leather has frayed. The base squeaks oddly. I place a soft blanket on the seat because it hurts my bottom otherwise. For anyone else, this chair looks and feels like junk. But it has always kept me from flopping unnecessarily. 
Flip Flappers contains a lot of flipping and a lot of flapping. And, while it doesn’t have its own chair to sit on, it likewise doesn’t flop. 
Flip Flappers is a story about Cocona’s maturity from childhood and into adulthood. 
A bold statement. Maybe some out there are saying to themselves right now, “Dude, what are you talkin’ about?” 
When the anime begins, it treats the audience to something fun but not yet worthwhile. Papika and Cocona have a cute relationship. The worlds they visit are fascinating in their weirdness. And the death-defying stunts, the magical-girl transformations, and the silly-centered comedy provide many a scene that keep one’s attention. 
Yet, simultaneously, the makings of a subtler, more involved tale exist. 
For instance, the anime infrequently depicts famous trick drawings. Two faces stare at one another to outline an hourglass, and a young lady’s pose makes her seem much, much older. 
It also drops names that are too specific to be coincidental. Cocona’s rabbit’s name is Uexküll, a reference to Jakob von Uexküll who championed biosemiotics (the study of biological signs and symbols among species). Similarly, the evil organization chants Asclepius, a reference to the Greek god of medicine who was killed by Zeus for meddling with human immortality. 
Even the worlds themselves, while often rooted in goofiness and genre, tell more than they let on. A strange plain of existence with only white walls and floors stretches towards infinity, and a desert considers BDSM and invigorating potatoes the norm. 
Subconsciously (a relevant word for Flip Flappers if there ever was one), the anime feeds the audience these nuggets of intrigue. It slyly plants its threads, ingraining in the viewers the realization that the show is deep. Impressively so. A set of worlds and themes and ideas that cry out their avant-garde status. 
Take episode six. Cocona and Papika enter a gate within Pure Illusion. Within this new realm, the two simultaneously exist as a young girl named Iro, living out her dichotomous lives as a child. On one side, the destructive family home harboring hate and cold. On the other side, a kind old lady welcomes and warms the soul. “Iro is Iro,” yet, when their neighbor succumbs to dementia and forgets their (shared) name, she wants to switch places with herself. While an impossibility, they at least remind their neighbor of their name – and accidentally alter reality as a consequence. 
In short, and in just this episode, Flip Flappers targets the duality of life, the self, and how memories shape one’s future. Pretty darn avant-garde. 
Crazily enough, the anime takes this approach all the time. It doesn’t only dive into these dense themes offhandedly or sparingly. Indeed, it does so constantly, threading together larger themes on identity, thought, and perception. 
In episode seven, Cocona, having lost Papika, encounters different versions of her friend. A younger sister, a delinquent boy, a destruction-hungry senior classmate. After meeting with them and hanging out with them, she still concludes that these people aren’t really Papika, tying back to its theme on identity. The end even involves its theme on perception when it’s Papika who finds Cocona since, to her, she was the one who was lost. 
In episode eight, Cocona and Papika befriend a tiny scientist and defeat a massive alien. That scientist built that entire world, defying the odds stacked against his stature. In turn, Cocona and Papika (and Yayaka) do the same, obliterating their foe beyond recognition. Here, perceived capabilities are challenged as is one’s thoughts on the task at hand. 
In episode ten, specific plot details manifest as obscured truths. Papika unknowingly had amnesia. Yayaka pretended to be Cocona’s friend. Cocona’s “grandmother” lied to her. These thought-inspired revelations tear down Cocona’s perception of reality to the point that she loses her own identity. 
The show contains an uncanny number of instances related to these motifs on identity, thought, and perception. Too many to both list here and dismiss as mere straw grasping. However, the examples from above should illustrate that Flip Flappers explores its many themes in both interesting and varied ways even late into its run. 
Like Pure Illusion, though, it goes deeper. 
Looking at these threads, they interweave, but it’s not fully clear what bigger picture their knitting creates. Thankfully, Yayaka’s words in episode five start to reveal the grander interpretation behind Flip Flappers. She says, “Once you enter a Pure Illusion world, you’re influenced by its nature.” 
The most important word there? Influence. For Cocona, when she enters these otherworldly places filled with sweet snow and spider monsters, the environments influence her and the actions she takes. Often, she can’t stop herself from living out Iro’s life or squaring off against Papika as a mind-altering mask brainwashes her. 
But that’s more than being influenced; that sounds more like control. 
It happens almost every time Cocona enters Pure Illusion. The snowy forest controls her movement, carrying her along the backs of giant worms. The haunted mansion controls her time, sending her through the same loop again and again. The plain of nothingness controls her position, locking her away as Papika and Yayaka clash. Even the whole point of collecting the amorphous – controlling Pure Illusion – relies on the concept. 
Identity, thought, perception, control. Flip Flappers has enough thematic density here to hand out to every anime around it and then some. Yet, somehow, someway, it still doesn’t stop. 
In the final arc of the anime, Cocona’s mother Mimi (officially) arrives. She takes control of the situation and of her daughter, reinforcing its themes once again. More importantly, her arrival forces Cocona into the last major conflict of the story: breaking away from her mother. 
Cocona must leave her parents’ nest so to speak. Only the nest is a boat in fantasyland and her parents are a tabletop condiment and an aural receptor. Nevertheless, Cocona must finally mature. 
Astoundingly, Flip Flappers has always followed this same story: Cocona growing up. Only it’s been framed in that avant-garde manner the entire time. 
Remember those worlds in Pure Illusion? They also featured Cocona experiencing acts of a pubescent or sexual nature. Teething as a bunny. Getting all “hot and bothered” around the ghostly girls. Laying on a bed, in nothing else besides a black gown, next to the succubus form of Papika. 
Remember those events in the regular world? She repeats many of her early actions when she has the same dream, puts on her clothes in the mirror, and heads off to school. That is, a routine which doesn’t define her. She fails to find purpose in her future, tagging along with Papika on their adventures just because it’s fun. 
Remember those themes throughout the whole journey? Knowing one’s own identity is a part of maturing. Thinking more critically is a part of maturing. Understanding different perspectives is a part of maturing. Controlling one’s own fate is a part of maturing. 
What at first seemed like just an anime involving a cute relationship, weird places, and action on occasion comes together as this smart, rich tale of a girl finally growing up. In other words, Flip Flappers becomes that bold statement: a story about Cocona’s maturity from childhood and into adulthood. 
Even after all this dissection, two important points remain: the integrity of the narrative itself and the coherency of the connections made. 
Starting with the first point, and being as fair as possible, the anime struggles on a basic writing level. It introduces an evil-organization subplot that the show not only fails to flesh out properly but also ends up meaning very little once Mimi appears as the main antagonist. The dialogue can also get quite bland as Cocona yells “Papika!” and Papika yells “Cocona!” at least a thousand times (give or take) each episode. And the flashbacks present in the final arc mistime both their pacing and their position. 
As for the second point, it’s worth wondering: Are these themes simply plopped next to each other to give the illusion that they form something more worthwhile? Well, yes and no. Yes, because the show does not go out of its way to bridge these separate ideas together. No, because the sheer number of examples is too large to ignore outright. 
No matter what, it’s clear that Flip Flappers tried to do something more, something different. If nothing else, that’s at least worth a commendation. 
Flip Flappers maintains almost as much visual strength as it does thematic depth. 
On an artistic level, the anime does about as much as it can. It makes use of a lot of vibrant, varied colors to paint both Pure Illusion and the regular world with intrigue and finesse. A rainbow-esque bunny-morphing machine world. Orange sands that drape over dunes. Purples and pinks and blues light up a strobed techno city. 
The semi-soft style helps too, providing a calmness in its lush forests and underground laboratory. Attention to cinematography and shot composition make cuts like an upside-down reflection of Cocona off a puddle of water with a clocktower in the background the norm. 
Plus, Flip Flappers takes advantage of its lighting. Be it Buu-chan’s lightbulb creating the silhouette of a skull around Papika and Cocona in episode one or how in episode two light fills the whole classroom save for the shadowy bar that covers Yayaka, the anime knows how to make the most out if its lighting. 
Its character designs are likewise impressive due mostly to their complementary nature. Cocona and Papika are opposites (short and long hair, bright orange and depressed purple). Their magical-girl outfits are awesome, too, with their swapped color preferences, frilly black-white-pink dresses, and hard heels. 
Yayaka deserves a mention, too. She pins her bangs back, the dark-pink streaks that part her blonde hair serving as a reminder of her grey morality. Her black soldier suit with accompanying hookshots give that cool edge. But it’s her later eyepatch, cape, and belt (now with only one hookshot) that turns her into the nomad who abandoned her “home” to protect the only thing she holds dear and highlights her character development with but a single glance. 
Like its storytelling, though, the subtler artistic choices give the show its strength. Looking at Papika and Cocona’s magical-girl designs once more, they rely heavily on a butterfly motif. Butterflies on their hair, chest, and hips are visible, and the yellow wings that grant them flight make them butterfly-esque, too. And how are butterflies created? Through metamorphosis. A fitting biological act given Cocona’s own metaphorical growth from a baby caterpillar to a full-fledged butterfly. 
Other details are affected as well. When Papika saves Cocona from falling into the black hole in episode seven, their spaceship is none other than the concrete tube they regularly stay in. Yayaka and Cocona first met at a hospital waiting area, so how coincidental that their main place to hang out with one another is a nurse’s office. During the Iro-memory dive, Buu-chan makes an “appearance” as a yellow, four-wheeled cart that Papika drags along with her. And that big painting in the hallway of the school? It actually depicts Mimi floating in a pond after her (evil side’s) defeat – which is exactly what happens event-wise. As if fate was saying that Cocona will inevitably win and will thus eventually mature. 
How about one more example? During episode five, the anime recreates a famous scene from The Shining when Buu-chan wheels around a corner and sees the evil twins down the corridor. Another clever inclusion, considering the premise of this famous horror film (warped reality through insanity). 
Flip Flappers is undoubtedly Cocona’s story, but her two best friends make all the difference. 
Cocona starts off in regular anime fashion. After taking some mock exams at her cram school and later speaking with her advisors, she’s unsure of what path she wishes to follow. A fair spot for any middle-school-almost-high-school teenager to be in. 
In strolls Papika. Or rather, she glides in, whisking Cocona away to Pure Illusion where she experiences a world she has never known. At first, she’s apprehensive. It’s too weird and too dangerous, so she wants no part in something that she feels will inevitably bring harm. Yet she has fun. A concept she’s not necessarily used to as she follows the same routines at home and continues to lack confidence in her own future. 
Both worlds challenge Cocona. Her dreams control her mind. Her indecisiveness controls her identity. Pure Illusion controls her perception. From very early on (albeit avant-garde), the anime centers Cocona on those important themes. She also starts to try new outlets and learn more about herself in the process. Yet, as she hesitates to reenter the realm, and her actions influence the real world, Cocona ponders whether she even should be here. Yayaka’s constant warnings don’t help matters either. 
Thankfully, Cocona has Papika. 
Papika is technically the deuteragonist of Flip Flappers, but her role is less main protagonist and more ultimate supporter. And she’s darn good at supporting, too. Papika is cheerful. Simple-minded yet sincere. She brims with energy and happiness, letting nothing demotivate her drive to enjoy life and all its wonders. Indeed, that’s arguably her greatest strength: always moving forward and refusing to stop and wait. She finds it difficult to say complicated words, and she has a hankering for food (green bunnies too). But she always has Cocona on her mind. 
That’s something regularly seen. In Pure Illusion, Papika’s often the one who pushes Cocona along, grabs her by the hand, or otherwise encourages her to go beyond. She wants to be there for Cocona no matter what, for she sees her as nothing less than her most cherished companion. 
Their foil setup is a classic one – timid, mature character paired with the outgoing, silly one – but it works. Papika makes up for Cocona’s inability to have confidence in herself, and Cocona keeps Papika reeled in as best she can. While the two don’t always get along, their friendship blossoms as they Flip Flap into their magical-girl alter-egos and overcome the different dangers of Pure Illusion together. 
Unfortunately, Papika can’t do everything for Cocona. On the deserted island, Cocona finds herself way too far in over her head. And the different worlds see her controlled by bunny teeth and helmets and ghastly girls. 
It also doesn’t help that Papika starts to regain her memories, and, in doing so, she starts to confuse Cocona for somebody called Mimi. Cocona gets upset at Papika for not being able to tell the difference, but they don’t outright have a falling out. At least not until Papika fully unveils her backstory. At which point Cocona says those dreaded three words: “I hate you.” 
All the while, the last important character – arguably the strongest in the anime – has made several appearances up to this point. Her name? Yayaka. 
Flip Flappers characterizes Yayaka as a semi-delinquent who likes playing hooky and hanging out in the nurse’s office more than she does thinking honestly about her next place of education. However, she’s not completely without care. She’s close with Cocona, grabbing her in worry and going so far as to note how soft her friend tends to be. 
Yayaka isn’t the same, and she says about as much on more than one occasion. “My mindset is totally unlike yours.” When she reveals that she’s working for the other side, the evil organization, she backs up her claim well enough. 
She steals the amorphous gems when she can. She does not get along with Papika whatsoever. She continues to follow orders from her higher-ups. Nevertheless, Yayaka doesn’t drop her friendship with Cocona. She warns her when she can. She also gives her advice and even helps sparingly. Despite all the bad she’s associated with, Yayaka still demonstrates good. Moral mixing that easily adds dimensionality to her character. 
Her motives remain mostly a mystery in the first half of the anime, but, come the second half, the audience learns more about her and her situation. Her organization disapproves of her constant doting on and laxness with Cocona, stripping her of certain privileges and threatening her with removal altogether. And, through certain flashbacks, the show shows Yayaka befriending Cocona from a young age – to get close to her for the organization and thus earning her a “home.” 
The climax of her conflict occurs in episode nine where she wages war. War against Papika, the girl who has “stolen” her own best friend, and herself, the girl who must choose what matters most. After everything, she shields Cocona with her body, demonstrating as clearly as possible the choice she has made. 
Yes, Yayaka lied to Cocona. She admits that. But that doesn’t mean Yayaka and her had nothing between them. Indeed, Yayaka knows deep down that the time she has spent with Cocona has affected her. Changed her mindset to one that’s perhaps not quite unlike hers. 
Thus, she does what she can to prove it. She helps Papika rescue Cocona as the enemy invades Salt’s laboratory. Later, she makes up with Papika, rekindling her motivation in the process. And together they chase after Mimi to save Cocona within Pure Illusion because that’s what friends do. 
The ultimate proof of her full development writing-wise comes when she finally, successfully, officially Flip Flaps for the very first time. She cries out what’s nestled wholly in her heart: that Cocona is the most important thing in her life. It’s a strong moment not only because of the cool action sequence that follows her transformation but also because it definitively marks a satisfying conclusion to her entire character arc. 
And so it is that Papika and Yayaka save Cocona. One could argue that it’s a “the power of friendship” type deal. However, given the focus on Cocona’s maturity within Flip Flappers, it’s most likely more than that. 
Becoming an independent person is important for personal growth. But that doesn’t mean one can do it all by himself or herself. Just as Pure Illusion requires partners to enter together, so it is that Cocona needed her best friends to finally escape from the control that trapped her, to finally allow her to mature into the person she could always be. 
As for the other, forgotten side characters – Salt, the twins Yuyu and Toto, Professor Hidaka – they unfortunately remain rather extraneous throughout most of the season. They’re either given too little to mean much to the larger story or they receive almost nothing at all. Salt’s growth comes through small snippets of flashback. The twins eventually look up to Yayaka. Hidaka is little else besides a mad (and hysterical) scientist. 
Arguably, these characters get the attention proportionate to their importance. After all, the anime is really about Cocona, Papika, and Yayaka. Meaning, it’s fair that the majority of the extra side characters simply don’t matter in the long run. 
To that end, Flip Flappers builds its trio in strong fashion. They aren’t as impressive as its narrative, and they’re not exactly incredible on both an individual and group basis. But the show provides them with enough traits, moments, and changes to mark their characters as notable successes. 
It almost doesn’t need to be said: the ending track of Flip Flappers wins in the music department. In fact, one could argue that it’s the best trait of the entire show. Indeed, even the anime plays it one last time following the final scene rather than letting said scene lead the audience out. 
What makes it so strong? Mostly the composition itself. The rising and falling tones. The whispering “Flip” and “Flap,” one for each ear. The fairytale instrumental work. Not to mention how the whimsical nature of the piece fits Pure Illusion quite well, and how the fun, almost playful approach invites its listeners to both bob their heads and sing along to its catchiness. While not as deep as the story of Flip Flappers itself, the ED is arguably the show’s most memorable facet. 
The opening track and the rest of the original soundtrack don’t reach anywhere near the same level as the ED, but they as well have their strengths. 
The OP contrasts with the ED, incorporating a lot of techno beats and effects to create an empowering song. Its second half is particularly awesome. Rousing vocals, background cheers, and slight forays into lighter chimes pump the audience up for what’s about to go down. 
As for the OST, it contains a wide array of different musical options. Cocona and Papika transform into their magical-girl selves through a dainty tune replete with fairy sounds and twinkling changes. A slow piano piece rings out as worry takes over Cocona’s heart in the cold and the trees. An acoustic-guitar version accompanies her bittersweet realization that Iro didn’t keep her promise. A happy tune with woodwind instruments and light bongos plays as Papika cheers up Cocona when she feels “empty.” 
Voice acting doesn’t stand out as much as the music does, but the more niche performances certainly do. Michiyo Murase as Uexküll the bunny rabbit waggles her tongue to hilarity. Kazuyuki Okitsu as Buu-chan sputters his name with determination. And the creepy “qrE3TInqs” girls of the haunted school make the audience want to close out the video right then and there from fright. 
I am a fan of esoteric, artsy stories – and the same holds true for this tale too. 
While watching the show, I found myself having fun. Papika shouting about unfairness or running around without a care in the world made me laugh. I liked the action, too, especially when they started to transform into magical girls more often. But the real fun with these kinds of shows comes afterwards. All the digging and research and interpretations. 
The further I investigated the anime, the more impressed I became as I found more throughputs, layering, and importance. I wasn’t expecting it to connect an idea of control throughout itself. The overall purpose of the story – to showcase Cocona’s maturity – is also something that surprised me as it all came together. Even the worlds of Pure Illusion. Their symbolism, settings, and similarities were far more involved than I initially thought. 
I will say, I’m in agreement with a sizeable portion of the community: execution worsens during the last quarter of its run. The rushed pacing, to cram everything before it ends, doesn’t make the transition go smoothly. The flashbacks are lame in their construction, too. And, while petty, Iro’s neighbor’s vocal performance got on my nerves. 
Even so, Mimi’s involvement adds more layers to the already thick thematic sandwich the show offers to its audience in restaurant style. (But I still don’t like the old lady’s voice.) 
I do wish the show didn’t get repetitive with its worlds. Two of their visits were just their own school and town (the scary episode and the multiple-Papika-personality episode), and the final arc simply reuses the other worlds that were already in rotation. Still, I can’t be too hard on it. Given everything else it set out to do and accomplished, I’m willing to give the show some leeway. 
And my favorite part of the entire anime? Toto, with a blank expression on his face, spinning wildly in the visuals of the OP. It made me chuckle and say “Whee!” every time without fail. 
Flip Flappers doesn’t do everything right, but its drive for something bigger and better and beyond leaves a lasting impression. Robust thematic depth. Careful artistic choices. A stellar ending track. In the end, who needs a chair when one can fly so high? 
Story: Great, small pacing problems and unimportant subplots aside, this avant-garde narrative about the growth and maturity of a young girl, supported by thematic density through identity, thought, perception, and control, provide a tale that, like Pure Illusion, is more than meets the eye 
Animation: Great, color, lighting, and artistry abound, but it’s once again the subtle details that scream the loudest 
Characters: Good, Yayaka goes through a satisfying character arc, Papika brings the support, and the two work with Cocona to help her mature, but the lack of attention given to almost all the side cast cannot be dismissed 
Sound: Good, good OP, great ED, good OST, okay VA performances 
Enjoyment: Good, esoteric experiences are often the most interesting 
Final Score: 8/10

    Style. Almost every episode has a style of its own. Almost like wasting ideas that could have been used on several different titles upon just one. The styles are not completelly different, they share the basic details in common. The overall drawing of everything is different from any other anime,  resembling things like Kill la Kill maybe. The drawing is outstanding, everything is super-bright, colorful and shiny. Every frame is like a picture in itself, and every detail has a clear purpose in a visual sence. Playing of different of colors with each other has its own effect. Beautiful. 
Bright charecters with charisma, sound, background music, fairy magical story about traveling between worlds, everything besides art plays along with the art so that all falls into the whole anime in a seamless fashion. As long as it's whole and seamless it looks magical. Anything extra would be just redundant. Everything is done excellently and nothing is redundant hence 10/10.

    Flip Flappers was an anime that got me excited about watching something on a weekly basis for the first time in the longest time. It seemed to be a show that had a lot to offer while putting up a deceivingly generic look. It had a mysterious way of presenting itself that subtly distinguished it from something we've seen too many times already. Sadly, the same can't be said about how things turn out after about half way through. 
The show had a lot of quirks that would have you question if they are being subtle or just written poorly but it showed a lot of signs that they were self-aware of where it stands that were reassuring. I hate to use the word ""mature"" but Flip Flappers really seemed to have something more serious  with the themes that they were building up. A lot of the conflicts felt like they were leading somewhere important and ""mature"" to the point where ambiguity felt intentional. Even the aftercredit scenes that mysteriously never really got mentioned in the next episode felt like a narrative device that was going to be explained as an important part of the plot later on. A bit of a stretch, I know, but the show had me anticipate a lot of great things.  
The characters, while still within a reasonably generic archetype, felt like something that belonged within the given universe. They were shown in a way that had me accept that they could very well be living people. Believable personality is something that is missed quite often in anime and I think Flip Flappers is proof that decent writing can make generic characters interesting and maybe even seemingly complex. There's something sincere about their overall behavior and makes a few cheesy scenes easily bearable. Though honestly, I'm just glad their personalities aren't dedicated to being simply cute. Though, I would still argue they are cute. 
Every episode was a different experience especially with its surprising range of art direction. Overall quality seemed almost too good to be a regular TV show. They're filled with meaningless but cool references done tastefully and a lot of clever composition and dynamic lighting. You may not agree with me when i say Cocona and Papika are interesting characters, but I don't think many can deny that Flip Flappers had some impressive visuals. The change in mood for each episode is handled very well and makes it hard to guess what will happen next. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of impending struggle which made it exciting to see not just the new settings but also how the characters will react within it. They all seemed to work well for a show that sells itself as an episodic adventure.  
However, things seem to go a bit shaky mid way and falls apart by the end. A lot of ideas and potential development seem to have dropped completely and everything just became extremely straight forward with a lot of underwhelming expositions that lack the same witty self-awareness it had before. Things that seemed important are either never discussed again or turned completely irrelevant. Characters start to literally explain the analogy  behind certain imagery within the show as if it had lost its faith in the viewer's intelligence. Even the visuals are obviously worse than previous episodes for what were supposed to be some of the key moments of the show. As harsh it may sound, it turns into a show that really could have been any other show. Basically, it became something I originally avoided to watch Flip Flappers instead. A straight forward plot and a straight forward dialogue aren't necessarily bad, but it's definitely not what I kept watching Flip Flappers for.  
The drop in quality took me by surprise and disappointment. To summarize my experience with Flip Flappers, it went from being more like the ED song to being more like the OP song. There just seems to be a lot of thought put into the aesthetics to the ED while the OP is arguably generic and unfitting with the tone of the show. Ironically, the outro/preview music that comes after the ED is very catchy as well.   
I really wanted to like Flip Flappers and I genuinely did up to about episode 7-8. The rest is up for debate. Maybe I was just over hyping and over analyzing things. Despite what I have said, I would still recommend watching Flip Flappers as the first half of the show is worth witnessing regardless of how you may feel about the other half.

    Overall - 7: 
This show is a well animated, enjoyable mess of a show. The plot is all over the place and nothing makes sense, but if you look past that you might enjoy the show. 
Story - 3: 
I'm not going to try to dress this up, the plot is bad. In addition to either being far too complicated to reasonably explained or much too magical to try to put rules to the show focuses too much of its effort on delivering plot twists. I love plot twists, but in order for them to be meaningful the story has to make a reasonable amount of sense and follow through on what those plot twists mean to the story. This show fails in both those aspects. 
The plot functions well when it's not trying too hard to deal with the bigger picture and just focuses on the fight at hand, and it does this well in the beginning. Unfortunately this didn't last. 
Art - 7: 
The worlds the characters go to, the fights they have, and the character designs themselves are all top. The day to day stuff not nearly as much, but it's still functionable. 
Sound - 8: 
The OST really has some good tracks in it, and the ending theme of the show is one of my favorite anime songs of all time now. 
Character - 8: 
The characters are great, and the more screen time they get the more you understand about them and feel for them as well. This means that some of the side characters just aren't as appealing, and characters who don't get much screen time in the beginning can seem bland until they get their development. 
The characters also suffer from some of the bad elements of the plot, making their relationships to each other get confusing. 
Enjoyment - 8: 
This show was very fun, and I really enjoyed it (when it wasn't too caught up with the plot). There were times where I was hyped up for the fight, amazed by the worlds, and choked up by some of the sadder moments. I was annoyed by the frequency with which the characters called out to each other (seriously, not only did this happen like every episode but they just keep calling out again and again).

    I absolutely love Flip Flappers! This is one of my favorite series from Fall 2016. Without further ado, let's get into my review on why this anime is that awesome. 
Story (8/10) 
The story ain't anything special. It's just an adventure story between two girls. However, it is told in  an interesting way. There are episodes with their individual story but the story are still well told. Nevertheless it still kept me entertained. 
Art and Animation (9/10) 
The visuals on this anime is just awesome. Each scene in this anime are well done. The art and animation are both unique. It doesn't follow the typical moe art style nowadays. The animation sometimes reminds me of studio Trigger and it suits this anime pretty well. Don't believe me? Watch the PV. Granted that there are people who will not enjoy this art and animation style,  but personally I love it! The opening visuals did well in switching from the dark side to the bright side. The Ed theme is unique in using picture book style ending we normally see from Disney. 
Sound (8/10) 
The OP theme is catchy and the ED theme is cute to listen. The soundtracks are nothing special but each of the soundtracks is used in the correct scene. Never did a scene feels off because of its BGM. 
Character (8/10) 
This is where the anime shines. Although the character quirks are cliched, however it still can't change the fact that the characters are well developed and interesting or enjoyable to look at, particularly our 2/3 main characters.  The relationship between Papika and Cocona are well developed and cute. None of the characters are annoying or unlikable, at least in my opinion. However, beside the main characters, the side characters just came off as bland and underdeveloped, nevertheless they are still likable characters.  
I enjoyed this anime to its fullest because of the art, animation, OP and ED theme music and visuals, and also the characters. So I will definitely recommend this anime if you want an anime with a cute girl and girl relationship and also unique artstyle.

    ""Flip Flappers"" is an outstanding show and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a short anime that is really engaging. The story line has so many great plot twist and will keep you watching until the end. The art is outstanding because the artist show many different forms of art in just one anime . The sound is really good in sub and works well in the anime. The character development is so complex and intertwined but not to much to get most people confused. I really enjoyed this anime and I give it an overall 10. This is one you have to watch.

    It has been a long time since I've fallen in love with one character this much, let alone two, three, four gah the entire cast for this show is friggin great! 
The second half is definitely so much better than the first. Don't get me wrong, the first half is a fun FLCL trippy road trip through time and space but the second half is deeper and more heartwarming, more pulse pounding and overall just the better part of this anime. 
I nearly dropped this anime before the episode where they go to that desert world, I'm a fan of Henshin Hero shows so that one caught my attention to say the least. 
The last thing I want to touch on is that this anime is one of the best representations of parenthood I've ever seen, not gonna spoil it but this show certainly is a fine example of just how far parents will go to try and protect their children even if it's not for the child's own good in the end. 
The ending was very happy for a magical girl show in this day and age which is what I was dreading, not knocking Madoka but it's good to see some Shoujo heroine's can still earn their happy endings. 
Oh yeah, and the op and art are some of the catchiest and smoothest things I've seen in a long time. A big round of applause to Studio 3Hz, may just check out Dimension W now.

    Flip Flappers. Yep, Flip Flappers. An anime about… something. With a name like that, Flip Flappers could be about a number of things. Most people would think it’s some sort of children’s show. But anime are children’s cartoons anyways, hurr durr. But, is that really so? 
Well, this original anime by Studio 3Hz, which did Dimension W, that ran from October to right before the New Year of 2016 is a mash up of many genres. While MyAnimeList lists Flip Flappers as comedy, adventure, and sci-fi only; it is not actually so. I don’t even know why it’s being touted as a sci-fi anime. It’s not sci-fi. 
Anyways, this little 13 episode monomyth has basically got it all. Drama, yuri, comedy, horror, and you name it. Many people have resorted to describing Flip Flappers to be: “‘Inception’ met ‘FLCL’ and they both had gratuitous threesome sex with ‘Kodomo no Jikan’ in a liquor-fueled one night stand to produce this coming of age story about two middle school mahou shoujo probable closet lesbians”. 
Yeah, I was paraphrasing up there but I bet I caught your attention with that. If not, then, go read the MAL synopsis again. 
If you read the synopsis and thought that Flip Flappers sounds like any other mahou shoujo anime then you, sir, are horribly wrong. 
Let’s first talk about the story. 
Being compared to Gainax’s actual magnum opus, that is FLCL and not that trash Neon Genesis Evangelion, one would expect a lot from Flip Flappers – especially in the department of ‘God, I have no idea what’s going on but I sure am loving this!’ 
While FLCL and Flip Flappers do share a lot things in many departments, the story is actually the place where they are the least similar. 
FLCL had a distinct style of relaying its story that heavily relied on comedic exposition through visuals and saucy dialogue. Flip Flappers adopted style and slightly changed it into an episodic format friendly one. With each episode, the style metamorphosed just enough to let each individual episode come off as its own unique portion that subtly builds on the world of Flip Flappers through creative use of varying scenarios in the anime’s rather flip-floppy plot device (maybe location in this context?) called Pure Illusion. 
To be honest, this way of story telling is very confusing for viewers who aren’t used to noticing every teeny tiny detail in a scene. Bring subtitles into the picture and the viewer tends to miss out on even more details. That means to fully enjoy Flip Flappers, at least second watch should be essential for most. I know I will be rewatching it as I think I missed out on a major plot point. And, if I didn’t miss anything then Flip Flappers has a giant plot hole. Either way, not going go discuss that part due to fairness. 
This also shows the kind of issues prevalent with stories like the ones Flip Flappers and FLCL have. 
At times the pace might be really slow and then accelerate matters into full gear in five seconds tops. For an anime like this, that isn’t really a problem unless if the areas of snail-hood go into filler-like territory. This is, sadly, something Flip Flappers tends to do a lot. While Flip Flappers is director Kiyotaka Oshiyama’s first full-fledged work, he still has had a lot of practice with anime greats like Dennou Coil, the Fullmetal Alchemist movies, and the second season of Space Dandy. He did a good job with Flip Flappers but, honestly, he could have done a bit better. 
Other than these points, Flip Flappers has an engaging story with a somewhat satisfying conclusion that’ll require you to fire up some neurons to actually understand the story. It’s nothing mind-blowing but you still get that warm feeling like the one you get right after an intriguing puzzle. 
In my opinion, the greatest thing about Flip Flappers’ story is that everything is in the anime itself. You won’t need to go online or harass your neighbor’s weeaboo pet dog for answers. In the case of FLCL, pretty much most of the story was almost entirely up to one’s imagination. That thing was cool chaos in animated form but it didn’t help itself by butchering it’s coherence. 
Now onto the characters. 
For a coming of age story, the main character has to be great. Coconoa is not. She is just okay and that wouldn’t have been a problem if she wasn’t the worst character in the entire anime’s cast. Even the two twin villains, whose most recognizable trait is that they repeat the one another’s line, she routinely goes up against are more interesting that her. Maybe if Coconoa was just a bit less emo for her age then she would have been loads better. It’s true that she is empty and the anime is about her finding her identity but she wasn’t handled well in that regards. The biggest moment of these to not is when she blows fuses a couple of time for tiny reasons which is something her character isn’t supposed to do at all. 
In comparison, Papika was handled much better better. While she was still a tad one-dimensional at first, she quickly rose up to shine as having the most and best character development by the time the last episode hit the credits. Going into detail about Papika would require me to spoil the story but I will say that she should be paid closer attention than Coconoa. The same goes for the rest of the characters. While being heavy cardboard cutouts, they each had their own funky charm. Hell, the Goddamned pet rabbit of Coconoa had more personality than her. 
Nearing the end~ 
The character designs and the fun use of many saturated colors provide the animation with kind of spunk and whimsical intensity a show like Flip Flappers need. The animators knew what they were doing. Unfortunately, they didn’t have the time to fully realize their goal so many corners had to be cut. 
As usual, I watched the anime in 1.5x playback speed and noticed a number of places where the color was missing and things like a character having an item in one hand and not having it in the next were very common. You shouldn’t be noticing things like these in visually heavy anime at increased playback speed. I’d be damned if I don’t say that at times the animation had many frames missing and it felt like I was watching at reduced speed… 
The background music was fun. I may snag the OST sometime soon. I didn’t like the OP. The ED was just perfect. 
Voice acting is same as most stuff. The crazy scientist was the summit and all of the times Papika goes on her usual ‘coconoacoconoacoCOnoaCOcoNOAAAAAAA’ spiels was downright fucking annoying. 
To end, I’m going to say that Flip Flappers is a 7.5/10 in my book. 
Ignore the rating and still watch it. It’s a fun ride I’d recommend to anyone. Except for lolicons.

    Flip Flappers is an anime fairy tale.  It brims with wonder from start to finish, much of its action taking place across various fantastical dreamscapes.  The series features magical girls complete with transformations, but Flip Flappers neither follows in the footsteps of the magical girl genre, forgoing the emphasis on daily life and casual romance for full immersion into the magical, nor does it seek to be a deconstruction by setting its story in contrast to the norm of the genre, instead budding out into its own new branch. 
The series begins episodic, each episode its own story with anything left unanswered at the end of the episode remaining unanswered, or cleared up in the unshown time between the episodes.  As the series continues the episodes gradually gain more and more continuity, up to the final third of the series where the episodes are undeniably tied together.  It is in this final third of the show that the story's moral question is brought into focus, as the main conflict of the series comes to light and is eventually resolved. 
By far the most wonder-filled, fantastical, and colorful anime I've seen to date, Flip Flappers gets an absolute recommendation from me.

    Flip Flappers is a story which struggles with its own identity. Simply put, it was most enjoyable when it didnt take itself seriously.  
The main premise is that 2 girls, Cocona and Papiko are to make multiple trips to an coexisting, yet elusive world called 'Pure Illusion'.  The first 8 or so episodes really did a great job at unraveling this interesting world, and had me coming back to learn more.  Every episode there was a new idea of Pure Illusion- the haunted time loop house, the neo-city, and the monster filled iceland, were the most memorable for me. Ideas were getting tossed around and it was a ton of fun. The interactions between the duo are cute and lighthearted. 
The art is also worth mentioning, the way this show handles artistic story telling, with a color palette ranging from vibrant to dull, is incredible. Action sequences are consistently fluid, with the use of flashy sakuga. 
The opening, Serendipity by ZAQ, embodies the whole mood of the show pretty straight on, with upbeat electronic music, beautiful fight scenes and with the beginning lines ""into the sky""embodying the sense of adventure I truly felt when watching the first 9 or so episodes. But after that point, the opening just serves to remind us that the show has truly strayed away from what made it great in the first place. 
The story at some point, takes itself way too seriously. There is a hilarious lack of build up for the tension that arrives. The drama crashes in like a toddler who was testing the limits of a bike. It is rushed: the reveals, the explanations, the revelations, the resolutions. It never feels right. At some point, I was thinking ""what if they used their animation budget to make more episodes instead"". Everything good about the show I've said before, besides the art, just gets thrown out the window at some point. It leaves the viewer unsatisfied. Nothing feels complete, or established. The show becomes over ambitious- attempting a plot to wow the audience but leaves its former identity in the gutter and its viewers scratching their heads. 
Flipflappers is the guy in elementary school who is working on a perfectly fine art piece, peeks at someone else's, and ultimately ruins his own in an attempt to copy the piece he peeked at (aka me). Complicated plots are cool but there's no reason to fix anything that's not broken. I can't bring myself to give this show that low of a mark, because I truly enjoy a big portion of the show. But it is because I enjoyed it so much at first, it is more the disappointing that it turned out the way it did.

    Flip Flappers is to say the least, a confusing yet highly enjoyable anime. The story is about 2 girls named Papika and Cocona travelling to other worlds to get these amorphous. Every world they travel to is unique and has its own gimmick. On the surface this story seems simple but it can be hard to keep up with.  
The story is pretty good if you can follow whats happening however, to the normal viewer its hard to keep with the twists and turns. One minute you think you have it all worked out than suddenly, something else is revealed that makes you rethink the entire thing. At least it ended pretty good compared to other anime. 
The animation is some of the best I have seen (To be fair though, I haven't watched many anime renowned for having great Animation). It looks great throughout and shines during the fight scenes. From the epic op to the final fight the animation is superb. 
The op ""Serendipity"" is amazing, with the stunning visuals and the beautiful track. This is one of the few animes I watched the op everytime. The ed is ok at best though. It has some nice little clips but I found myself skipping it often due to wanting to move onto the next episode. 
To sum up Flip Flappers, it is an anime with a confusing but intresting story, stunning visuals and a relatively good soundtrack.

    Flip Flappers is equal parts confusing and enchanting, but those are perhaps the only constants in a story that isn't sure what it wants to be.  
This underlying dissonance raises questions about narrative decisions as one undergoes the tumultuous journey: Why even introduce Nyunyu? Why was one episode randomly a drawn out mecha battle? Why dedicate so much time to building up and later revealing the backstory and ties of the shadowy, antagonistic organisation Asclepius if it is simply going to be cast aside as Mimi fills the role? What are the goals of these opposing organisations, anyway? 
Perhaps none of that should matter, because the focus of Flip Flappers seems to lie in characters. This is an aspect the show does fairly well, with side characters like Yayaka, Iroha, Mimi, and Salt having remarkable stories. The biggest plot developments - conflicts and climaxes - involve character relationships that aren't necessarily tied to the bizarre, inexplicable premise. This, mercifully, allows some tangible semblance of progression. 
True to form, Flip Flappers' highlights are inconsistent with the rest of the show. The slightly terrifying episode spent in a dark, looping version of the school is masterfully done. The tragic experiencing of Iroha's story, and witnessing the bittersweet result of changing her past, is the type of content I wish Flip Flappers had explored more frequently. Mimi, Papika, and Salt's past is also a strong highlight, but suffers from the fact that it comes as a result of a jarring change of focus late in the narrative. 
The art of Flip Flappers is its most effective facet. The fantastic worlds Cocona and Papika explore are beautifully crafted, and the entire show has an endearing hand-drawn sort of aesthetic to it. Combined with some comforting music, Flip Flappers very occasionally commands a unique and magical aesthetic that sadly gets lost among the suffocating amount of intrusive questions raised. 
While its inconsistencies in everything from tone to pace do allow for its strongest points, Flip Flappers would have been better off picking one direction to fulfil. However, as much as it can feel like fumbling around in the dark, I would still say it is an experience worth taking to anyone who can see the light at the end and forget about the rest.

    Have ever tried mushrooms or LSD? Want to have the same experience, but without negative effect on your health? Boy, There is an anime for you!!! 
Story: Flip Flap out of 10 
The last sentence. Do you remember what it ...? Of course, not! You are high, now! Let's go to an adventure! 
Art: Tripping out of 10 
Whaaaaa!!! So many colors! Outlines! Shapes! Everything is liquid! Unless ""it's really hard"" (literally what Cocona said, if fansubs are correct). 
Sound: INTO THE SKY!!! out of 10 
No tripping experience is complete without appropriate music. And ""tripping"" is literally part of the lyrics of ED (in English, not translated). 
Characters: Dripping tears out of 10 
Papika, Cocona, love, 'shrooms! You still remember anything else about the characters? Let me give you another pill... uhm, I mean episode. What characters, it is just Pure Illusion! 
Enjoyment: Socchi mo Kocchi out of 10 
Do you watch drama to laugh at the characters misery? Do you watch comedy to cry about characters troubles? Do you watch action to follow the normal people's life? Do you watch slice of life for the action? If you are one of those kind of people, you might enjoy this anime. If you are not, well, you better judge this anime by its genre. But what is it? 
Is it comedy? Is it magic? Is it sci-fi? Is it adventure? No. Do not believe MAL tags. This is entirely new genre, with the only appropriate name would be ""tripping"" or ""mushrooms"". Being one of kind, it achieve its one of a kind goal - getting high. 
If  you are serious person, who wants enjoyment in a limited time you have, perhaps you should skip this anime. If you are tired of anime and have nothing else to watch, this might bring you back to the dark side (or in this case to colorful land of Pure Illusion).

    RE-POSTING this review since it got deleted (b/c Flip Flappers finished airing or whatever), but I´m just gonna leave eveything as it is, inculding my update after completion c: 
I'm gonna be straight with you, there's about a 50/50 chance that you will either absolutely LOVE this anime, or it simply just isn't for you and you'll find it “meh” at best. I, for my part, happen to be one of those people who've been waiting YEARS for something like this. Fair enough, this has its very own reasons. So let me tell you about Flip Flappers: 
In its core I'd say this anime is about PERCEPTION and furthermore, PERSPECTIVE. We follow the main characters, Cocona and Papika (I honestly love almost every character in it, the twins for example are fucking priceless), and they go on adventures together in a world they call “Pure Illusion”. Said Pure Illusion is meant to serve as “visualization of the mind” ...although it's not always so clear, whose mind it may be (this time). 
This is the basic idea behind it. I'm not going into detail here for fear of giving anything away, so let me do this review differently by starting with some “negative” aspects: 
- ART: I get that a lot of people are probably thrown off by its look. This is exactly what happened to Madoka Magica. But while Madoka Magica did this to fool the audience in order to shock 'em later on, Flip Flappers looks like this because it needs to. If it weren't all girly, colorful and over-the-top, it wouldn't quite get its messages and its actual meaning across. Or at least not in the way it should be done. Which is why I think this style suits the anime perfectly, not least because it IS in fact a fantasy/sci-fi show, though, if you look closely, a coming of age story: very largely about self-discovery through overcoming fear, doubt and other obstacles. But before we're getting into spoiler territory I'm just gonna stop here~ 
- “FANSERVICE”: There's seemingly random bits of fanservice here and there. Or really just some weird scenes in general :'D For example episode 8, which suddenly increases in ridiculousness and made even me cringe a little - not because of the fanservice per se, rather because it's paired with such a cutesy look. But here's the thing! The reason why Flip Flappers gets away with it is because it's all within the context of 1. the respective world they're in and 2. the anime's true intentions. Meaning that, if you cringe, then that's because it WANTS you to. The show's aware of how you perceive it and might or might not do something to oppose that (for example when Hidaka takes off his glasses in ep 12!!! GOLD), and that's genius if you ask me. 
But talking about true intentions, I'm actually done with everything remotely negative, so here's EVERYTHING I TOTALLY LIKED about Flip Flappers: 
When I finished the first couple of episodes, I had literally no idea what I had just watched. I thought it was something like Adventure Time, only with cute girls giving off some innocent yuri vibes, or rather, another yuribait and nothing more- but hoo boy, did I underestimate this show...! 
Really, it seemed so random at first, nonetheless so incredibly FUN. The show throws so many ideas at you, one after the other, similar to FLCL some would say. And for that alone it would've gotten 8/10 already. But then...you suddenly get it. That one thing the story itself may be truly about :-o And never ever in my life would I have dreamed of an ANIME whose story would actually, genuinely cover this exact issue, all the while doing such a great job at it. In fact, it's done so smoothly, I didn't realize it myself the first 4-5 episodes in, despite me relating quite well to it all. 
This is a highly symbolic show with more than just one or two layers. It manages to criticize and “play” with genres and TV tropes, and it does this in such a charming way!!! It twists the tropes around, averts, subverts or underlines them. You've got your references to Alice in Wonderland, Sailor Moon, DBZ, Evangelion, the KKK... Hell, even Mad Max! Yes, the plot is certainly not flawless and it leaves some things unexplained. 
But still, nothing this anime does is unintentional. *Except maybe Nyunyu's entire existence lol. However, if you're able to read between the lines/look past the screen, there's gonna be one or another aha-effect for sure. 
- 
UPDATE: 
Okay so after having seen all 13 episodes, I think I'll have to lower the score to a 9, but hear me out! It's not like the ending was bad, I liked it. It's just that the last three episodes or so seemed terribly underwhelming compared to the sheer awesomeness that is ep 1-10. 
There were some pacing problems, the animation worsened (b/c budget I guess) and it left some things unsaid which I feel should have been adressed very urgently. But you know what? I don't give a damn. Good show, adorable af ♥ 
The ending could've turned into complete shit and I'd still love, love, love this anime 'cause I already got everything I wanted from it prior episode 10 tbh :') Ep 10-13 may as well could've never happened. But overall it's extremely rewatchable. I feel like I've missed a LOT of hints that may make me see the big picture even better once I rewatch it, so I will.

    This series was watched in Japanese dub with English subs on Crunchyroll. Thus, the “Sound” category refers to the Japanese voice actors and actresses.  
Flip Flappers has to be one of my favourite anime series. 
The story was good, 7/10. Each episode showed the journey Cocona and Papika going through the world of Pure Illusion in order to grab all the crystal shards. The story could have been approached a tiny bit better but I enjoyed the fact that it was not too cliché. The story appealed to me a lot, especially towards the end.  
The art in my opinion was amazing. The art showing the transformation when Papika and Cocona shout out “Flip Flapping” has a shoujo vibe to it which I am still am trying to get used to. This is where I felt where it could have been cut down and had a bit more of a realistic vibe to it but yet again, this part is basically the cliché part where they transform and eventually beat the evil; nothing else. Thus, I suppose it does not need to be realistic and it is just my tastes that I need to change. 
The voice actors/actresses were amazing.  It felt that the voices matched their characters. I did not notice the background music being awful. It blended in well with the certain scenes. The OP and EDs were not perfect but they were not all too bad. At first, I did not really like the OP but now I can stand it at least. The ED at the start does not really have a kicking explosive start but the chorus is where I decided to make the ED one of my favourite EDs.  
I felt that all the characters combined were well balanced. However, I felt that some characters did not react to situations in a realistic way. This anime, however, was not portrayed in a realistic way, but fiction. There were some antagonists were just there to be there, however, other antagonists did have motives. I also felt the supporting cast was perfect. They were not too bland. I generally hated the antagonists because of their evil nature. However, the antagonists needed to exist in order for this anime to be what it is or else their flip flapping adventures will become all for naught. (no antagonists mean they did not need to go on flip flapping adventures and just enjoy school life, making it become a slice of life anime instead. 
I overall think this anime is very enjoyable. I might even re-watch it. I feel that others can also enjoy this anime as much as me. This is probably an anime to watch for people who just cannot decide what to watch. I recommend this to absolutely anyone. Cocona and Papika shall stay in my heart forever. These two characters are what makes the show enjoyable.

    A Flip Flappers Review 
This is a series that really had me going for a while. I knew almost nothing about Flip Flappers going in, and to my pleasant surprise, the show made me want to learn everything about it within a couple of episodes. It presented something that felt so fresh and original while also displaying an unspoken variation on that of which it was derived. Building off of magical girls in magical worlds, Flip Flappers reimagined what came before it with a heaping amount of playful ambiguity and managed to stay utterly engaging despite how thoroughly confounding the show probably would’ve looked to be on paper. 
The first three quarters of the season exemplified this, as we watch the main character Cocona get dragged into a world of “Pure Illusion” by Papika, a girl who’s seemingly very innocent, passionate, and hard to communicate with. We’re given about as much information about this strange new place (and the strange people entangled with this situation) as Cocona is, which is to say barely anything at all. “Pure Illusion” is what the name implies, and exists in a space separate but connected(?) to reality. These two, who originality meet by Pure chance, have the ability enter these worlds and search for “amorphous fragments”. Nothing is explained about what these things do or why they need to be collected, we just know that Papika has a desire to collect them. 
The show is full of unclear motivations, be it with the immensely ominous organization of assumed villainy or the tiny group of underdogs that are seemingly the “good guys”. It’s all a matter of only answering the most rudimentary question of “what it is they want”. For most of the season it’s not revealed why exactly they want these fragments or how they’re going to go about utilizing them. With such bare-bone motivations, it might be hard to imagine just how this show could be so compelling without a firm grasp on the stakes at play. 
Well as it turns out, clear-cut stakes aren’t always necessary in capturing a viewer’s full attention. By putting a heavy focus on the characters, Flip Flappers directs its narrative spotlight away from the plot and instead concentrates on the two main characters and their growth. As Cocona’s and Papika’s relationship goes back and forth between love, resentment, confusion, and other neurotic emotions, we’re able to witness Cocona open herself up and also shut herself in as she tries to make sense of what exactly is happening. Their personalities complete each other, as Cocona has quite the anxious spirit, but also just enough indecisiveness that she’s able to be dragged along by Papika’s innocent fearlessness. Together they take part in the joys of unbridled adventure, and no adventure would be complete without a few hurdles. 
As if these random worlds of pure imagination weren’t already dangerous enough, Cocona and Papika turn out to have some competition. Cocona’s childhood friend Yayaka turns out to be some sort of trained hunter of amorphous fragments, and alongside her are two monotone sidekicks that seem to be robots because of their complete lack of compassion, but it’s never actually delved into. All we know is that they work for that ominous evil group. Of course, only the audience gets a glimpse of this and not Cocona, but the villainous force behind these three is a massive cult with an unknown goal and an unmeasured amount of power at their fingertips. It’s only to be assumed that they are in fact “evil”, but it’s a pretty safe bet considering their outfits look like the KKK. An interesting choice, but race has ultimately nothing to do with the show. Instead what I think was meant by this aesthetic choice was to convey a sense of overwhelming and misguided desire for purity. Anyway, the mysterious ambition of the group remains unwavering, but Yayaka herself is not quite as committed. As the story progresses, she begins to show her feelings for Cocona and how those emotions are a detriment to their cause whenever the girls end up fighting over amorphous fragments. And that’s about when we get into the final quarter of the season. 
The way the show set itself up to be until this point was something I thought was extraordinary. I felt like I knew so much about these characters in a raw, impassioned sense, rather than in a manner of just learning the cold, hard details. Flip Flappers didn’t tell me a damn thing, and it really felt like the show expected viewers to understand the basic formula of the action genre because it wouldn’t explain almost any of it. It would play with these illusionary settings to illicit certain response from its characters as well as convey things about them through the environment. Episode 6: “Pure Play” for example, plays with color and memory, contrasting warm, homely recollections with cold, morose reminders of loneliness and pain, all by having individual characters and settings colored with either shades of orange or blue. 
It was thoroughly engaging and thought provoking, as Flip Flappers treaded the not often taken path of showing its story rather than telling it. Not that either approach is necessarily better than the other, but Flip Flappers started with the former and I was hoping it would stay that way. Instead, it suddenly devolves into a very contrived exercise of needless exposition. Certain characters sit in a very mundane setting as one of them explains to the other their view of what exactly is going on, and why the fate of the world depends on it. Then the show flashes back to the cause of Pure Illusion and makes sense of how these characters got to be entangled in it, in a very straightforward fashion. The story becomes something else entirely, and while I don’t think the final twist is at all a bad one, it lacks the narrative presentation that made the show unique in the first place. 
Without getting into spoilers (I’ll save that topic for another time), motivations are made clear by the end, yet the show still has some non-philosophical or particularly interesting questions left unanswered. Certain characters are introduced for what appear to be absolutely no reason. Specifically, a loli character with a ridiculous outfit that serves no practical purpose whatsoever. There’s also an art student that’s around for about two episodes then just disappears, plus we never really learn anything about the amorphous twins or what they do after it’s all over. It’s strange that the show is leaves these random things ambiguous, when just a moment ago it seemed to want to explain everything to its audience. 
The ending, while I think strong at its core (again, saving that discussion for later), is a bit random and what surrounds it is poorly thrown together. It starts to lose focus on Cocona and Papika, which was the most powerful thing the show had going for it. The center of attention stretches too far as it allows characters with almost no screen time up until this point to suddenly have important roles to play, which just ends up feeling like a feeble attempt to tie everything and everyone together. The show has three distinct characters’ worthy of attention, and it probably should’ve just kept that focus rather than throw in more needless elements that don’t all entirely come into fruition. 
It’s a true shame considering most of the show was a Pure delight. The animation is superb, the action is incredibly satisfying, and the settings of Pure Illusion range from wondrous and awe-inspiring to very contained and deliberate in conveying a sense of characters and relationships. Not only that, some of the worlds seem to be forms of charming parodies, like the desert wasteland reminiscent of the planet Tatooine from Star Wars. 
Now before I end this review, I’d like to give spotlight to my favorite character: Papika. She is a very interesting type of character, one that I can only recall in all my history of watching anime one other time. While she isn’t explicitly defined to be this kind of person, it seems to me that she indeed has some form of mental impairment. Her compulsiveness, strange social behavior, single-minded persistence, and limited speech patterns; I’ve only researched a little about it for this review, but I’m pretty certain it has to be autism. And that’s a really interesting and hard to understand perspective, not only to introduce in a story, but to create as a main protagonist. The way she shares the stage with Cocona demonstrates that regardless of mental impairments, they’re both equals. Then their reliance on each other show they’re both incomplete. And I guess I just find Papika to be the more fascinating side of the relationship because her disabilities and incredibly innocent outlook on life offer a perspective not as common as the insecurities that ail Cocona and define her personality. 
For the most part, Flip Flappers is unabashedly unique and adventurous. While I was personally disappointed in how thing play out in the end, it couldn’t possibly ruin the intrigue and elation I’d felt leading up to that point. Its settings are amazingly vibrant, creative, and push characters in smart directions while sometimes telling even more about them than the dialogue itself. The characters will certainly stick with me, and although I’m glad their story was contained within a single season, I also can’t help but long for more. Without a doubt, watching Flip Flappers was a…Pure joy *snickers as everyone reading this rolls their eyes*.

    Flip Flappers is an original entry in the magical girl genre focused on middle school student Cocona and her interactions with the energetic Papika as both adventure in the alternate world of Pure Illusion taking on enemy creatures and acquiring magical powers from the amorphus gems that are left behind by the creatures when defeated. 
The one thing that sticks out with Flip Flappers is its gorgeous animation when the series is taken over to Pure Illusion. The scenery of Pure Illusion offers up some rather creative and bizarre environments and enemies that Cocona and Papika encounter in their adventures that include a colorful landscape where our two heroines start to develop rabbit-like characteristics and a gloomy version of their school that traps the two girls in a time loop. There are a variety in the types of threats that Cocona and Papika have to confront within Pure Illusion that allow for some variety in the type of choreography seen in action scenes throughout the series from a typical superhero-powered battle to even a mecha fight. The animation has some shortcomings with character designs looking a bit on the simple side for details in certain regards and some of the animated sequences looking a bit jerky with movement. But these don't detract too heavily from the rather unique presentation offered with Flip Flappers. 
Moving past presentation, Flip Flappers' storytelling is mostly straightforward with focusing on Cocona and Papika's adventures. The first half of the series is mostly focused on the two girls collecting the amorphus gems they acquire from defeated enemy creatures, learning more about the world of Pure Illusions, developing their relationship, and crossing paths with a rival organization also seeking out the amorphus gems for mysterious reasons. There are hints dropped in early episodes that Cocona and Papika may have a closer connection than what it would seem on the surface. The second half gradually explores these developments (and what is revealed leads to a dramatic twist for the series compared to its more light-hearted mood) and the motives of the rival organization in question, which eventually build up to a climactic battle that tests the bond that our two heroines established with one another throughout the course of the series. The revelations mostly make sense when looking back on some of the hints dropped, though there are a few unclear elements to the plot that Flip Flappers regrettably does not address in its finale. 
Minor issues aside, Flip Flappers was still a solid entry in the magical girl genre having a creative alternate world that Cocona and Papika have their adventures in and offers up an engaging plot focused on exploring the bond and connections that our two heroines have with one another. A solid recommendation if you are a fan of magical girl titles.

    Flip Flappers is without a doubt eye-pleasing. The first half of the series is intuitive, spontaneous, and entertaining. At first, the story is confusing. It's not clear what you're watching but makes you connect the dots as you watch more. For one thing though, the animation is superb.  
The themes are not clear cut, they're actually quite ambiguous. The show's themes require you to think a little bit and piece it together which can be challenging but interesting. It makes you think and each scene is meticulously made to probe thought. But as you watch more you'll find the themes resonate more as a coming-of-age story surrounding the main character, Cocona such as gaining independence and exploring your place in the world and identifying who you in relationship to the people around you.  
Unless you wanted this theme explicit to you, then this may not be the anime for you.  
Otherwise, this anime relies on animation a lot to help the audience make inferences about the story and drive the momentum of the story. However, this also means that the characters are not fleshed out enough. I feel like the show had a lot of opportunities to grow their characters more but a lot of them are left without actual substance to the story. For instance, there are a few characters that come up that are seemingly important but if you were to think of their contribution to the anime as a whole, that importance may not be there.  
Also, the pacing of the anime is confusing (perhaps re-watching might change my mind about this). The first half of the series is a slow-build and it gets more intense towards the last 4-5 episodes. But as the series goes into the end, the story becomes messy and there's a lot of information thrown at you which can be overwhelming. Surprisingly enough, the animation quality is still consistent. But, there's quite a number of plot holes and ongoing questions that the anime fails to answer or give closure. There is some attempt to answer these questions but it's still very ambiguous episode after episode. 
Overall, the the series is highly commendable. It's intuitive, fun, and very eye-pleasing. The use of colors and animation is superb and impressively consistent. An ongoing problem with the show is that there's a plot holes in most of the episodes (probably due to their heavy reliance on using animation to tell the story) and become more frequent in the end of the series. However the ambiguity makes you think and urges you to piece it together.  
Also, there is a tendency of throwing too much information at the audience especially towards the end of the series. The characters are not fleshed out that much but perhaps this was done intentionally to probe that ""coming-of-age"" theme. 
Even so, I would urge anyone to watch this anime. It's entertaining, amusing, thought-provoking, and fun-loving. Give Flip Flappers a chance!

    Story: 7/10  
The story follows Cocona, an ordinary, rather quiet middle school girl whose life is changed when she meets Papika, a very outgoing girl who tells Cocona that she has been looking for her. Papika takes her into a tunnel that leads them to a strange world which she says is called 'Pure Illusion'. Here Papika tells her they must find treasures known as 'fragments'… they aren't the only people looking for them. It later emerges that Papika is a part of an organisation known as Flip Flap. 
At first I thought the plot was boring, but boy was I wrong! Watching the first episode made me say ""wow..."" and wonder what will happen next. Sure the story was normal, or more like a fairy tale one. But to me it was beautiful, imaginative, full of many plot twist that kept me watch until the end. 
The art surprised me a lot, never thought it was that great. I loved the colors, especially in pure illusion, it was just gorgeous! The characters designs were also pretty good and fit the show very well. 
I gotta say, the OP and ED are both my favorite! I never skipped them watching every episode. The soundtrack was amazing and pretty catchy, and the voice acting does a great job, I loved Kayano's work. 
The characters are interesting and very unique. Cocona and Papika are the protagonists and they seemed pretty much the opposite of each other to me, Cocona is a calm and serious girl who's insecure about her future and Papika is a cheerful and energetic girl who's interested in Cocona. The two develop a strong friendship through their adventures in Pure Ilusion.  
There's also Yayaka, Cocona's other friend, who's a determined and strong-willed girl. She's my favorite character. 
I wish we get to know more about the other characters, I have nothing to say about them.. 
Enjoyment/Overall : 10/10 
This show is incredibly fun, the characters, the art, the soundtrack and the story. Everything was enjoyable! It is definitely worth the watch.

    Flip flappers is a criminally underrated show. 
Not a lot of people talk about it, and not a lot of people have seen it. 
It's a magical girl anime centering around going into a different world and collecting pieces. Sounds pretty basic, but it's far from it. 
It has a weird kind of art style, but it's extremely pretty and fits well with the show in general. 
Flip flappers can be very energetic and confusing at times, and somehow turn dark the next episode. It's an episodic show with a nice ending, fitting the pieces of the puzzle together. 
If you're the least bit intrigued by this, then go watch it now!

    Dimension Jumping Magical Girls with a dash of a ""Coming of Age story"" and a paintbucket full of beautifully bizarre scenery! 
LA wants to get straight into it...so let's dive into the technical rabbit hole shall we?. 
Flip Flapper's plot format for the first 10 episodes goes into a ""World a Week"" kind of schema but using movie and anime references as it's settings, such examples being Episode 3 having Fist of the North Star and Mad Max Fury Road settings to Episode 5 having the Shining merged with yuri genre settings to even the meta-narrative of ""archetypes and HECK the MECHA genre in one episode. Even their transformation sequences harkens to Pretty Cure's transformations to the point it's oozed into their attack names. The plot format surrounds Papika and Cocona trying to find the the ""amorphorus"" for the FliFlap organization under the various omni-genred episodes we get for unknown reasons and another rival organization by the name of Asclepius trying to get it as well for the first 9 episodes. Really these early 9 episodes was to emphasis and develop the relationship between our two main leads of Papika and Cocona through going through their trials and tribulations of their relationship and most importantly Cocona's indecisiveness, they both face when going into the Pure Illusion worlds. Come episode 10, all the hints and the reasoning to getting the amorphorus, Papika in general, Cocona's involvement in all this, Pure Illusion in general all comes into full force, something LA wasn't HARDLY expecting. In all respects, this development isn't exactly new as the hints were their just subtle in it's approach and because of this, the plot twists come episode 10 were amazingly executed, what happens after episode 10, the omni-genred feature of self-reflection and coming of age story for Cocona for Flip Flappers quickly changed into a yuri shounen anime...seriously that's the vibe LA got after this development, but that a bit later. 
Papika and Cocona are polar opposites for the most part and although it's an easy opposites attract what with Papika the hyper-always genki character who's rather clingy to Cocona, her mysteriousness can kinda be a saving grace to Papika (which was LA's perspective). Cocona on the other hand, is a strict, no nonsense character though she opens up halfway through the anime though she reverts or becomes confused by her relationship to Papika (quite frankly metaphorically visually shown in one episode). There is one other character, Yayaka who's a friend of Cocona but she's ALOT more that you'd realize and becomes a rather focused character by the end of it and her rivalry both in character and relationship to Papika and Cocona respectively really made an interesting character and really impacted the major plotline during the first 8 to 9 episodes, because of that she quite easily was LA's favourite character in the series. 
There are other minor characters that do get their own development episodes but through LA's perspective is shown through some of the Pure Illusion worlds, the most easily noticable being Iroha Irodori voiced by Saori Oonishi and if you could interpret it, Hidaka voiced by Jun Fukushima. Once again come episode 10, a floodgate worth of character and plot development focus on many of the secrets of Asclepius and FliFlap comes into focus and essentially reigns in character development from the various characters surrounding these two secret organizations WHILE keeping Papika and Cocona's development simultaneously. LA really can't explain more otherwise it goes GREATLY in spoilers, especially one character development who's enveloped and connect to ALL of this.  
The voice acting, there are two notable seiyuu's LA has to take note of, Ayaka Ohashi as Yayaka and Minami Takahashi as Cocona, they both nailed their characters greatly as well as giving them a wide vocal range though Minami had stuck round with the indecisively shy vocals due to Cocona during the beginning but she like Papika's seiyuu M.A.O got better over time. On speaking of which, M.A.O as Papika was narrowly annoying due to M.A.O's constant hyper genki status throughout their adventures and both M.A.O and Minami Takahashi shouting each others name in a moe cadence gotten M.A.O a bit of slack, but seriously, both M.A.O and Minami Takahashi as seiyuu's definitely gotten better over time. The rest of the vocal cast was pretty decent though some had the inflictions of hyper genkiness that M.A.O had like Jun Fukushima as Hidaka and NyuNyu's voice actor (was uncredited as LA wrote this). LA thought the one notable from the minor cast would easily go to Welwitschia's voice actor Aki Toyosaki in voicing one of the episodic villains and MAN did Aki go hammy in this one!.  
As for the soundtrack, LA quite easily loved both the OP and ED for this anime, but most definitely Flip Flappers OP ""Serendipity"" by ZAQ was LA's favourite OP for Fall 2016. The ED, ""FLIP FLAP FLIP FLAP"" by TO-MAS feat.Chima added to the bizarre fairy tale book feel to the anime and at times during cliffhangars did bring in either a moodswinger once this ED arrived but nonetheless both OP and ED were great for Flip Flappers. LA doesn't have much to say about the OST in general, though it was atmospheric to say the most, but the OST and the sakuga used blended soo well that LA hardly noticed the OST half the time (though LA is saying this in a good light). 
The animation, as LA stated at the preamble, Flip Flappers is an outright sakuga fest of animation and it's the more fantastical and broad reach of atmospheric detail from the crazy landscapes of the desert to tron-like cities to classic architecture to the more creepy mansion worlds and fast frantic battles makes LA be reminded of an Alice in Wonderland meets Anime kind of appeal to it's animation. The character designs are ""exotic"" and color-coded for easy distinction, not to mention LA just loves the parallels in color brought onto Papika and Cocona, easily coming from how Papika and Cocoa's hair color swaps during their transformation sequences further emphasizing Papika and Cocona's relationship with one another. What can LA say for Studio 3Hz, but if the anime's plot isn't getting to you, the animation most certainly will. 
The final three episodes if anything really did change into a cohesive narrative instead of the episodic BUT at the same time tying loose ends towards those episodic episodes and even call backs to them, this also gave a HUGE amount of character development to Yayaka, however she's a really heavy spoiler character in Flip Flappers overall, what LA will say is that because of these final three episodes, she herself came to her own realization and she became a very focused and 3-dimensional character. This also leads up to Cocona's own realization which comes in the form of the surprise major ""villain"" of the anime which brings themes of ""fate or your own freedom"" which again ties up loose resolutions towards both Cocona's adventuring with Papika throughout all the Pure Illusions to Cocona's relationship to Papika solidifying itself by the penultimate episode. As much as the narrative structure changed, it also helped that the ""episodic episodes"" lead into something much greater and just wasn't used to be ""filler-ish"" episodes which gets revisited at one point along with a few relational indecisiveness from Cocona to have a resolution but it also helped in the character development to most of the major characters as well. If there was but one flaw LA could see in the final arc was that it condensed what was the mystery and subtle background hinting to the bigger picture into a simple yet slightly complicated story with a villain who doesn't know any better (though again not a bad villain on that regards due to the circumstances) with only the major characters impacting the plot. What compensated all this was the weird and intensely fantastical final battle with this villain along with it resolving the majority of the plotlines, THAT was enough to satisfy LA with this kind of ending. 
Flip Flappers' episodic omni-genred nature to quickly change into a simple story with a villain just to resolve all the mystery behind Pure Illusion, Papika and Yayaka along with Cocona's indecisiveness. Flip Flappers had a great thing going with it's fantastical Pure Illusion worlds and the romp and character self-reflection, ""coming of age story"" as subtle hinting as good themes coming from these wondrous Pure Illusion worlds, it stumbled slightly however once it went into a cohesive narrative and turning what could have been turned into an anime with a bigger picture into a simple story, but LA can quite honestly give a saving grace for how the ending was resolved along with that final battle, but other flaws such as it's lacking character development from it's minor cast but nonetheless, LA doesn't think Flip Flappers NEEDED to fill ALL basis to be a great anime, what Flip Flappers ended with was good enough not to get LA's scorn for. Yet still praise it's storytelling in the form of Cocona's coming of age story, brilliant animation, soundtrack and satisfyingly resolved ending.

    This could've easily been a 10 if it flowed a bit smoother later on in the show.  
Art, Sound and Character don't need to even be talked about, every single character was so unique and likable, the ost was fantastic, I didn't like the op all too much, but I never skipped the ed. The Art is inexplicable. Violet Evergarden, heard of it? Fantastic animation, in my eyes it's the best I've ever seen. FlipFlap? The art style is nothing like Violet Evergarden, but in itself there is so much it entails. If you hadn't read the synopsis yet, some girls travel to a different world with so much variety to the point where you can almost make an entire anime dedicated to each and every adventure they go on. This alone combined with my score for art should tell you that the animators didn't let anyone down. I can't describe it in words, everything told a story. There were so many places they visited, all of which were packed with slight, well thought out details. Every frame interconnected fluently, and with all this came a wad of diversity. Near the end (no spoilers don't worry), Some of the characters' eyes start to slightly change color, and you can easily tell why. The art in this show is soo good, all I can do is look up to them and wish I could explain how their art is so much better than many, many other shows. 
Alright, I know I said those didn't need to be mentioned but I rambled on about them all anyway. Now onto the two lowest scored parts, both of which I rated nines, Story and Enjoyment. I will combine these into one little paragraph as the reason I didn't give enjoyment a 10 is because the story didn't quite reach a 10. At the beginning, I loved it. I told all my friends about it. Don't get me wrong, I did the same at the end, but things got a little wobbly in the last few episodes (just like before, there's no spoilers, no worries), but, like all shows, the climax started to kick in, and it started to get wobbly. Many things happened and plot holes were cleared up, some of which made a lot of sense, but others seemed random. Things began to happen simply because it made the most sense, and it did, everything was fluent, but when I started to fanboy about it, I realized there were some things that made absolutely no sense. And when some characters were going through changes it often times felt rushed and/or pushed to advance the show. To be exact, I felt slightly confused and annoyed by this a total of 2-3 times.  
Other than these small little holes that arise when concluding an episode, or the show as a whole, the premise of the entire anime is (9) Great. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was eager to watch the next episode. The show kept my eyes glued to the screen, and this is without a doubt a fantastic show. Everything flowed together like bread and butter and gave so much room for creativity in such a masterpiece. There is so much imagination in the art, in the music, in the characters, in us, the viewers, and in every other part of the show. I hope everyone reading this gets to experience this journey of a show, it truly is something breathtaking.

    Finding the hidden gem of a year is always the best feeling an anime fan could feel. In my short experience with seasonal anime (following seasonal stuff since around 4 seasons ago as of the creation of this review), completing this series was my reminder of why I follow seasons in the first place. Watching anime weekly provides the opportunity to try out stuff one would have never had given a shot if certain series were completed. I was really having trouble containing my thoughts for this series, which is why this review will serve as the way to express them. An anime who's name is what I imagined the title for a soulless kids show would be... get this... Flip Flappers. 
Minor Spoilers ahead. My overall thoughts can be found in the last paragraph for those too lazy to read, though I doubt this will be long anyways. 
The story of Flip Flappers can't really be detailed in much ways without getting into spoiler territory. MAL's synopsis for once does a good job at saying what this show is about (without spoiling), but it does not do the events that occur justice in every episode. The main character Cocona is an everyday middle school girl that encounters a red-haired, eccentric girl of her age (in a flying surfboard of all things) named Papika. Shortly after their first interaction, they end up in a parallel world where it snows 24/7 and giant white-haired mammoths are the norm. After a life threatening situation, the main girl's thigh birthmark starts glowing, she goes badass Super Saying and saves her (it sounds weird, I know). What happens next is a sort of ""episodic"" adventure between our main characters, with each passing episode embracing its random nature. Explosive sakuga action, fun comedy, the discovery of intriguing worlds, yuri undertones and an insane mix of ideas ensue.  
When I said this show is ""episodic"", there was a reason that I added it in quotation. This show does have a very linear plot. The reason I said episodic is because for the majority of the series, there's a huge ""where the hell is this going?"" vibe. At the end of each episode the viewer is left off with more questions than answers, wondering if their questions are going to be answered at some point. It sounds bad but trust me, the show shines its brightest when its setting things up.  
The story of this show is between two rival  secret organizations who send out middleschoolers (the two main girls working for one of these two) to look for mysterious ""fragments"" said to being capable of granting any wish if all are collected. Pretty straightforward and decent, but I found the main plot to be way more uninteresting than the ""episodic"" adventure. Basically, in the last episodes, the creator(s) making this show realized that they needed to wrap things up and answer things, so they did the best they could do to provide a satisfying ending. The end result wasn't bad by any means, but it is pretty evident that they focused more on making this a fun experience rather than having a thought-provoking plot. This reminds me of my experience with Re:Zero, where I enjoyed the journey a hell of a lot more than the main story. The story of Flip Flappers comes off as simple and lackluster compared to the insane ride we were given during the first 9-10 episodes or so. Since the show has to explain what they have set up, the last couple of episodes changes focus to other side characters that are crucial to the plot, but far more uninteresting than the original duo. My wish is that Studio 3Hz would have an unlimited budget to keep making episodic adventures between Cocona and Papika who are the real stars of Flip Flappers. 
Pop-culture References: 
It is always very interesting when a show references other famous works in pop-culture. This show didn't just made one or two references to real life works (for example how 3-gatsu no Lion referenced My Neighbor Totoro and made it a running gag, which was pretty cool btw), the show literally has anything and everything that would make the show cooler. It's like the creators of this show sat down one day, wrote down everything they liked from modern entertainment and decided to add it to Flip Flappers. Some include the following: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, how they literally chase a rabbit through a hole like in Alice in Wonderland, Star Wars' Tatooine, Dragon Ball's transformations and fight scenes, Mad Max vehicles and enemies, mayhem like in The Warrior and the Sorceress, a little bit of over-the-top animation from Ginax, Jackie Chan fighting maneuvers from Drunken Master, every Magical Girl anime ever, every Mech anime ever, Power Rangers, and many more that I am too lazy to look for. The show even does references to historical people and groups, like how a character is named after a German Biologist Jakob von Uexküll and how the baddies visualy are a carbon copy of the KKK (yep). Most references happen in the parallel worlds of ""Pure Illusion"" and seeing how unique and insane each look, I would have loved to see more, but sadly the anime has to come to an end and I am left wondering what other crazy worlds were left undiscovered. 
Yuri Undertones/Exploring Sexuality: 
For those who didn't follow discussions for this anime as it aired, there were plenty of talks whether this anime was a commentary on the LGBT experience told through a middleschooler and the self-discovery of being queer. For example, in many instances the show seemed to hint at something far greater than just presenting how good of friends Cocona and Papika are. Camera angles, optical illusions dealing with perception, fanservice, and other methods of cinematography were used to hint of a possible relationship between the two main girls. Hell, there's even an episode where Cocona straight up questions if her love for her friend Papika is just that, a friendship. Being completely honest here, I got pretty excited when stuff like this occurred (not in a perverted way, baka). In my opinion there aren't enough anime out there that explore sexuality, and the ones that do do not explore it in the way Flip Flappers does. An anime that dives into queer discovery being told through the eyes of a teenage girl, plus adding kickass sakuga and fun comedy sounds golden in my opinion. The setup was there and the subtlety was present, so did it deliver? Well, it depends on who you ask. The show takes the route where if you do not want these themes to be a part of your experience with this series then you will be okay (except for episode 7 were the yuri reaches its highest point). The best way I could describe it (being the geek I am) is comparing it to an Easter Egg in a movie or videogame. It's present for those who look for it, and those who don't bother to look deeper will never know. If you are looking for something more than just undertones you will be dissapointed just like I was. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the yuri subtleties that were present, but I cannot help but end with a bad taste of feeling like I was yuri-bated yet again. My crave for them yuris will never be satisfied. 
One of Flip Flappers' best attributes is without a doubt its visuals. This show is full of impressive sakuga action moments that look pretty amazing when they want to be (holy snap epsiode 3 was impressive). Of course it has its still moments, but for the most part it is a visual extravaganza, especially when the characters are in the parallel worlds part of what is known as ""Pure Illusion"" where the possibilities of fantasy are endless. The character designs are good and my only nitpick is that I found the character's eyes to be too far apart from each other making them look a bit weird to me at first, but again this is just a nitpick that I completely forgot about later on. Colors are also used heavily to convey emotion and establish a mood. Fanservice is apperant from time to time, but it's not ""in your face panties and tits"", rather more subtle and tasteful which I can at least appreciate. 
The soundtrack is another thing that is worth mentioning. It is not the best thing I've heard by any means, but it does a great job at setting the correct mood. The opening and ending songs are permanently stuck in my brain until I die because they are catchy as hell (I'm listening to the ED as I'm typing this ffs). The opening especially is perfectly fitting for this series. Just take a second and go check out the OP and tell me it doesn't get you hyped to watch the show. 
Character: 7/10 
What makes Flip Flappers such a great show (apart from all the unique worlds) is the characters, specifically the main duo you see on the cover. They have very different personalities, Cocona being a rather shy, cautious and well-behaved girl that cares for her loved ones and Papika acting as her polar opposite, with the only thing that they have in common is their love for others and one another. This back and forth between two completely different people make for very interesting dynamics and comedic situations. The side characters are okay with some having more development than others, but overall there wasn't a character I disliked (except for that pink-haired scientist that is just obnoxiously loud and serves as an unfunny comedic character). 
Conclusion: 
In the end, Flip Flappers is by far one of the most underrated and overlooked anime of the year. It is a memorable story about a girl overcoming her difficulties, and this self-growth is portrayed through parallel worlds that defy logic and understanding. It starts out great and gets better and better as the series progresses. Unfortunately, the last three episodes take a simplified route at answering the viewers questions that were built up throughout the series and is not nearly as good as the rest. Is it a yuri? Is it a magical girl show? Is it a clusterfuck of ideas? I'm not entirely sure yet, but what I can say is that Flip Flappers is one hell of a ride.

    When keeping up with 2016 anime, I would often watch a title with a nagging sense that something was missing - something I wasn't seeing that was keeping a show with a workable or seemingly exciting premise from being truly engaging. And yet, for the longest time I couldn’t quite put my finger on exactly what that something was. 
Then, as the year approached its end, I was shown a world almost entirely unlike anything I knew from that year. Suddenly, it all made sense! What was missing was surprisingly simple: a sense of passion - ambition! A willingness to take risks - to try something bold, run with it confidently, and, perhaps most importantly, to have fun along the way! 
This key ingredient sums up exactly what Flip Flappers sets out to do, and for the most part, it delivers in style! It’s not a show that’s interested in playing it safe, running with the pack, or following the norm. It does its own thing in its own world. It remains committed to this and never looks back. Not only does it feel novel, but as it runs, it succeeds in providing something many of its contemporaries struggle with: pure, unapologetic fun. 
The show immediately pops with a striking presentation style that is excellent for the experience it attempts to create. Anytime the setting enters the whimsical world of Pure Illusion (which it very frequently does), a vibrant and impressionistic colour palette combines with sketchbook character designs to create worlds which immediately pop out at viewers; smears and flashes of colour - the worlds themselves - comes alive onscreen through highly expressive and fluid animation, all backed by a suitably fantastical score. Whenever this show wants to sell a big set piece, bombastic moment or climactic sequence, it does so with ease, energy and expression filling every frame! These moments are exciting; often breathtaking, and they combine with a general livelihood and an ever-present sense of wonder and novelty to immediately make Flip Flappers a fun watch! 
But such moments aren’t the only things contributing to this anime's flair. The very nature of Pure Illusion - an abstract world which seems loosely representative of characters' inner states of mind - is a perfect fit for this style of entertainment. Flip Flappers can effortlessly realize just about any setting it wants without it ever feeling out of place, nor completely random. This is great for keeping the level of variety and creativity consistently high. With this, and since much of the show runs on a cohesive semi-episodic structure, pretty much any crazy idea the show comes up with can be successfully built up to, and then executed with gusto! 
And so, when the main pair of magical girls suddenly finds itself in an epic high-speed flying surfboard chase to escape from a crazy torture factory, or a DBZ-style fight involving a mind-altering mask culminating in a meteoric final smash, it works like a charm! 
All of this crazy not-quite-randomness is thankfully held together by a controlled yet dynamic sense of tone and pacing. Each episode offers something new - something fresh - and each one makes an effort to go all-out with itself. In addition, it all ties into a core theme of the show: that of identity. Pure illusion itself is an expression of this, and in terms of story, each episode for most of the series tackles aspects of the theme in a different and interesting manner. One particular highlight of this (and of the show’s writing as a whole) came in episode 6. I won’t say any more on the matter, but it remains one of my favourite anime episodes of 2016. Point being, the show has a sense of cohesion that keeps most of it from feeling too unhinged, and allows viewers to build up expectations that it can subsequently defy in any number of ways. 
Just a few episodes in, I was already preparing to crown this my favourite anime of fall 2016 by far! And... in the end, I definitely think this is a show worth watching, but unfortunately, it hits a few stumbles. 
For all the strengths of the show’s presentation and structure, the characterization is often lackluster. While the main characters aren’t one-dimensional, per se, they tend to lack in depth or detail that could really make them interesting to invest in. The main duo of Cocona and Papika can certainly be fun to watch as they contrast with and bounce off each other, but this dynamic relies heavily on moment-to-moment chemistry and less on meaningful conflict or development. That’s not to say it isn’t present. Cocona in particular does go through several instances of personal conflict and development - disagreements with Papika’s adventurous ideologies being one example - but little of it, for Cocona or any other character, is presented with the kind of weight, importance or urgency to get a viewer eager to see them grow or overcome any difficulty. Similar things can be said for the rest of the main cast. As for the supporting characters, they’re pretty forgettable, with maybe one or two exceptions (Again, I refer to episode 6). As a whole, the characters don’t actively harm the show, but rarely do much for it either. 
One may also notice many of my aforementioned praises apply to ""most"" of Flip Flappers. Alas, it admittedly falters a bit later on, and in ways that prevents it from ultimately reaching its full potential. Sometime around the halfway point, Flip Flappers had a change of writers, and it shows. I suspect the general direction of the story was either changed or left on the sidelines for too long, because when things finally start unravel, they REALLY unravel. And so does the quality of storytelling. As if from nowhere, the show decides it has a ton of plot to reveal, and is going to pick up the pace as much as it deems necessary to get through it all. 
How much is that, exactly? Enough that all the viewer's attention is suddenly fixated on following this mass of new information and development, instead of actually enjoying the ride. Flip Flappers, which relies so heavily on its apparent simplicity and well-paced structure to remain grounded - to create its special brand of charm - loses itself to a degree when it comes unhinged. In its strives for progression, it sacrifices any chance to be reflective or create a sense of wonder and fascination, and it doesn't leave the audience much time to catch their breath either. 
The result resembles a rollercoaster whose design was unexpectedly and radically altered partway through assembly. What was once a carefully-paced ride quickly becomes a tornado of loops and corkscrews and twists and turns one after another, and another, and another, and another, while the track suddenly becomes bumpier and more hastily-thrown together at the expense of rider comfort! 
It’s almost as though they got two-thirds of the way through construction and realized the track was too straightforward, so they decided to build THREE TIMES AS MANY CRAZY TURNS into the last third to compensate! “What’s that?! We’ll make our riders dizzy?! No worries! We’ve got them in the cart already!” I admire the ambition, but Flip Flappers may have tried to tackle just a tad TOO much. Attempting to cram all the resulting plot development into 4-5 episodes was always going to be nigh impossible without the pacing suffering to a degree. If it had been granted a longer construction time and was a 2-cour series, then likely none of this would have been a problem, but regardless, what we got was, at times, a bit of a mess. 
Thankfully, Flip Flappers doesn’t completely lose its way during this segment. Even at its clumsiest of times, it never completely loses direction, and if one can keep up with its frenetic pace, the story can still be followed to a degree. In addition, its sense of expressiveness and energy remains mostly intact throughout, while the visual quality stays impressively consistent. And fortunately, this jerky ride still eventually reaches a fairly satisfying and conclusive stopping point (ending) so riders can steady themselves. 
One final silver lining to the comparatively weaker third act actually emerges from the previous ones, and that is the show’s knack for effective foreshadowing. For all the twists, turns and unexpected bits of information Flip Flappers eventually blasts through, many of them are actually built up to quite well. While a few things still feel a bit spontaneous, Flip Flappers as a whole rarely seems to haphazardly throw out its plot twists without some level of setup. I won't be giving anything away here, as even with the chaotic structure near the end, discovering these things can be fun to an extent. Amidst all of them, though, there was one revelation in particular that really impressed me with its unusual yet brilliant method of foreshadowing. Without giving too much information, one of the ways it hints at itself is through the very structure of certain episodes themselves, and the effect that structure has on the viewer. If that sounds rather meta, you’d be right, but if it sounds like I’m overthinking things, I can affirm I’m not. 
If only the viewer was a bit more invested in the character(s) involved. Then, perhaps, this revelation would have had more impact - beyond its novel execution - and indeed, the same can be said for the show as a whole. 
Ultimately, Flip Flappers concludes itself as an imperfect but valuable marvel. It strides forth unexpectedly, as if from another other world, seemingly out of nowhere, to show what it can achieve! As a thematically varied audiovisual treat, full of creative energy, it possesses a rare, passionate desire to do what many series forgot how to do: to just have fun for once. In today’s period of frequent anime monotony, Flip Flappers stands out as a welcome modern breath of fresh air; one that knows its strengths, and plays to them well.  
- FINAL SCORES & SUMMARIES - 
* Critical Quality: 6.5/10 (Story - 6 | Art - 9 | Sound - 7 | Character - 5) 
– Despite some late-game plotting and pacing weaknesses, as well as functional but unremarkable characterization, Flip Flappers excels where it counts. Its top-notch, vibrant, energetic presentation and consistent creativity really help it succeed. 
* Memorability: 7.5/10 – In addition to a strong sense of novelty, Flip Flappers knows how to craft creative and memorable moments and properly sell them, and does so frequently; it all gives this series a very unique identity. 
* Enjoyment: 6.5/10 – My enjoyment was brought down a fair bit by the final third, which simply wasn’t as engaging as the rest despite all the surprises and plot developments. But the “rest” I refer to was definitely a fun ride! 
* Overall: 6.5/10 – Flip Flappers didn’t quite reach the highs I was initially hoping for, but I still consider it a respectable series that achieved what it set out to do. Even with its setbacks, it has enough standout qualities to make it well worth watching, and I can confidently recommend it to anyone interested. One small warning, though: the ending theme won't be leaving your head for a while.

    Flip Flappers is one of those anime that craves a visual feast for the eyes rather than telling a cohesive narrative and developing interesting characters. This is rather an exception; Flip Flappers is a gorgeous looking anime. Brimming with strikingly colorful aesthetics of a whimsical fantasy world. The uniqueness of designing a fantasy world with different variations of its own world is a feat. Flip Flappers is all about visual presentation and it rightfully executes how that whimsical fantasy world can be. So why does this get a 6 regardless of the fact the anime has vast potential to be an underrated/hidden gem? Well, everything else was just overlooked and these overlooked aspect is what set apart of the cracks shown. 
Cocona is our central protagonist of Flip Flappers; A quiet and reserved ordinary schoolgirl encounters a strange hyperactive girl named Papika, who finds complete interest in Cocona just from her nice fragrance or scent. Papika drags Cocona into an alternate dimension strayed from their normal one, thus began their wild adventures of what is known as Pure Illusion. Not much is rather further developed beyond Papika's blatant fascination with Cocona and Cocona's indecisiveness whether she likes being on an adventure with said clingy hyperactive Papika. Their relationship can be summed up into a yuri-bait connection that felt forced. Yes, it is explained why Papika acts the way she does in later episodes but it does come off obnoxious when we are reminded that she loves Cocona. The other side characters are either forgettable and uninteresting even the ones that are developed.  
If there is one thing that Flip Flappers excels the most is the art design; the colorful cast of characters are very distinguishable and each episode have variety of art from cutesy and fun to gloomy and dark. The character designs are very adorable especially the main heroines. The colors pops or stands out to blend the aesthetics of the details in the background; a pleasing eye candy. The animation is also a noteworthy praise with intense heart pumping action. Although, the action sequences were just the icing on the cake. Nonetheless, the art is gorgeous to look at 
The structure of an episodic adventure is really good set up of variety of different imaginative and creative world Pure Illusion has to offer. It can range from a sci-fi Tron-like cyberpunk city to a post apocalyptic Mad Max setting. These aspects are implemented within these world and takes a unique spin of these worlds like adding mechs and magical girl power-ups. However, the following final act is what set the bar low on the expansive world of Pure Illusion felt artificial than what was already established.  
This is where the major criticism that hurts the overall experience of Flip Flappers. The final act/climax was clearly extremely rushed and the lack of direction. Characters are randomly added out of nowhere and served no purpose to the plot, excessive amount of exposition dump and seamless explanations of the world, removing the sense of boundless exploration that Pure Illusion was set to establish in the beginning. At this certain point, the interest was lost and the climax was focused on the story than the random adventures.  
I don't think Flip Flappers is bad, far from it. The poor writing, weak characterization, and the finale suffers the show's potential of an actual hidden gem. I wanted this to be something special than other mediocre obscure shows yet seeing through the cracks cannot be overlooked. Still, the the uniqueness of Flip Flappers will always be the visual presentation and how it was executed significantly as an eye candy experience. Watching Flip Flappers only for the aesthetics is your main reason why it is worth watching. It is a fun joyride through wild imaginative creativity.

    As with any type of storytelling media, the overall value of a show will be inevitably judged by how much the viewer makes out of it. And, if there’s a show that exemplifies this idea of a viewer’s dedication to enjoying something affecting their overall opinion of it, it’s a strange little magical girl show from Fall of 2016. 
Flip Flappers is one of the most polarizing series I’ve ever seen in anime. On the one hand, there are those who would defend it as ingenious and philosophically meaningful, while on the other hand there are those who dismiss it as cheap yuribait with a contrived and unfitting final arc. Obviously, I’m not going to be in the hate camp. But I won’t be trying to defend the show’s philosophical value either. I’m simply here to explain the reasons why I enjoyed a fun little Alice-in-Wonderland-style romp through the mind-bending world of Pure Illusion. 
CHARACTERS - 7/10 
The characters in this series are quite simple to understand, be it for better or for worse. Three stand out as our main heroines: Cocona, a melancholic schoolgirl who desires to quietly lead a normal, safe life but often finds herself going on fantastic adventures; Papika, an energetic girl who seems to be the polar opposite of Cocona in almost every way, and Yayaka, a more mature girl who seems to be grounded in reality as is Cocona, but even less so susceptible to the emotions that drive Papika. 
Some fans have compared these three girls to the proposed three parts of the human psyche: id, ego and superego. This comparison would paint a picture of Cocona (ego) being pulled towards emotional, spontaneous desires by Papika (id) while simultaneously being pulled toward more realistic, colder motivations by Yayaka (superego). Now, there is no way to confirm whether or not the writers initially intended to structure the interactions of their characters in this way. However, it certainly makes for interesting and believable interactions, because the fact remains that, whether intentionally or not, the characters do reflect the psyche and the internal conflicts felt by almost everyone. 
One of the biggest appeals of this show is the way that it embraces the “show, don’t tell” style of storytelling. The first eight episodes of the show focus almost solely on Cocona’s relationship with Papika, demonstrating to the viewers their characteristics and the clashes in their ideals by putting them in various fantasy situations that they’ll need to work together to get out of. Because of how, as the viewers, we able to experience the girls’ interactions firsthand rather than by being told about them via exposition dumps, the climax of the series when Yayaka starts to play a bigger role in the story feels much more meaningful than it would have if the show hadn’t spent its first two-thirds introducing us to our characters. 
The side characters, although fun, don’t serve much of a purpose other than to provide occasional exposition or fanservice. However, each of them, no matter how small their role in the story may be, undergoes a complete character arc by the finale. All of their motivations and worldviews are explained through flashbacks, which additionally help us to understand their reasons for doing what they do and, more importantly, why Pure Illusion behaves for them in the way that it does.  
VISUALS - 9/10 
Easily one of the strongest aspects of this show is the visual style. The art is totally unique, looking very much like a strange combination of SHAFT’s character designs and Trigger’s vibrant, energetic artistry. The characters are drawn beautifully, and the landscapes of Pure Illusion somehow look even better. The trippy watercolors that blend together to form the backgrounds are stunning, and very well convey the atmosphere for any given episode. The dull grays that blend together during the “horror” episode set a completely different tone than the neon lights of the “mecha” episode, which feels altogether unique when compared to the infamous “Mad Max” episode. 
Because Flip Flappers is a show about differences in perception of reality, another thing that it does exceedingly well is conveying a character’s emotion by showing what they can see. In one episode, Cocona and Papika are experiencing childhood through the eyes of girl in a dysfunctional family. When she walks in on her parents fighting, they are drawn very loosely, and they pulsate and distort, colors blending and changing to reflect the terror and confusion that this girl feels.  
Flip Flappers also likes to tell its story through the use of symbolism and optical illusions. Early on, a character shows up who will later be revealed to be a villain masquerading as a kindhearted woman. Her first few appearances depict her as the famous illusion that makes it impossible to identify whether the figure in question is a beautiful girl or an old hag. Later on, the show teaches us to associate two characters with each other by giving them the same clover crown at two different times in two different episodes. It even warns us that it will get darker near the end during the first episode, when Cocona and Papika huddle together in the unmistakable shape of a human skull. Even simple things like inconsistencies in reflections tell entire stories in themselves, and a sharp-eyed viewer is rewarded handsomely for their attention to detail. If you pay close attention, you can predict almost the entire show just by watching the OP. 
Finally, the animation during action sequences is absolutely brilliant. The fights are characterized by colorful explosions and bright streaks of color as the camera does loops and flips to follow our heroines. My personal favorite sequence is when Cocona and Papika fall through a tunnel into Pure Illusion, and the lines of their characters and the colors of ear skin and clothes begin to change and flash in a total acid trip of gorgeous animation. There is a beautiful scene when someone explodes into clover leaves that drift through the air in a single spectacular shot. 
During the final episode, the Flip Flappers team ran into budget problems. Because of this, there is an obvious drop in quality during the finale, causing the show to just look “good” and not “phenomenal.” But hey - Evangelion ran into the same situation, and everyone loves that show. 
SOUND - 10/10 
The soundtrack is, simply put, one of the best I’ve ever heard. The OP is very catchy, and all of the insert songs are memorable and fit the tone of the scene well. However, the real shining point in the soundtrack is the ED, which is not only easily the best ending theme ever, but one of the best pieces of music ever. Listening to the ED just once will give you a good idea of how the series plays out. It starts as a simple, upbeat song accompanied by little bubbles and other sound effects that fully immerse you in its musical world, but it gradually evolves into an epic, more-than-slightly foreboding and mysterious orchestral piece that sounds like something out of Madoka Magica. 
STORY - 7/10 
Flip Flappers is a show about the Umwelt. The Umwelt is a theory proposed by a scientist named Uexkull (people who have watched the first few episodes of Flip Flappers may recognize Uexkull as the name of Cocona’s pet rabbit). This theory states that perception of reality is different for every given organism, and that each interpretation of the same experience is just as correct as the next. This show takes the seemingly abstract and advanced concept of Umwelten and makes it much more accessible and fun by presenting us with a story about two magical girls who have the ability to jump into these realities created by other people’s interpretations of their surroundings. 
Now, what sets Flip Flappers apart from other magical girl anime is the fact that, after jumping into these Umwelten (called “Pure Illusion” in the show), what our characters do has a clear effect on the “real” world after they leave. Large amounts of the story are told through symbolism, and the viewer has to be paying full attention in order to get the full experience. For the first eight episodes, very little plot development actually occurs, or, at least, very little that is immediately visible. The final arc harkens back to everything that has happened thus far, and has the potential to catch the viewer by surprise if they got too used to the idea of being drip-fed a story. Flip Flappers draws influences from, parodies, and gives not-so-subtle nods to (some would even say “rips off”) Evangelion, Mad Max, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, Alice in Wonderland, and Nausicaa, to name a few. I won’t try to defend these influences due to the fact that they didn’t bother me. The story was still a good one, and that was what mattered. 
There are many theories as to what deeper meanings may be concealed within Flip Flappers’ eccentric plot. One of the more obvious points is the fact that, as the story goes on, it becomes more and more apparent that Cocona and Papika are in love with each other. As Cocona struggles to come to terms with her sexuality, she is eventually forced to confront an over-protective mother who is less than pleased that her daughter is a lesbian.  
Additionally, Pure Illusion has been compared to the Dantean model of Hell by some, as various characters in the show state that Pure Illusion has layers, much like Dante’s model. Symbols of Hell and similar concepts such as the Thinker statue, the Drowning of Ophelia, and a literal vision of eternal damnation populate the show’s early episodes. Now, as I said, I’m not going to try and defend the show’s supposed philosophical value. But I will state that the entire series is very open to interpretation, almost as though it is the viewer’s own Umwelt. I can’t say whether or not this is intentional, but it’s very enjoyable either way. 
The show can be divided logically into two halves. As previously stated, the first half is about Cocona and Papika’s relationship, and is very episodic. Some of the episodes suffer pacing issues, but nothing too dramatically awkward happens. Following the girls’ ninth trip into Pure Illusion, the plot finally kicks in and the show starts to feel more deconstructive, or at least much darker and more mature. Similar to how the Harry Potter books get progressively darker to reflect Harry’s maturing, Flip Flappers does the same as Cocona finally comes to terms with her sexuality. This is what has awarded the show with the most criticism: the ending. However, it didn’t bother me, because I saw it coming all along. 
ENJOYMENT - 9/10 
There’s not much to say here. I love this show. I would run home from school on Thursdays just to watch the latest episode, then lie down and ponder it for at least a good hour afterwards. I participated in drawing the great big thank you card that /a/ sent to the studio after the last episode. 
OVERALL - 8/10 
Flip Flappers is quite the enjoyable ride, for someone willing to keep an open mind and accept the show for what it is. It’s unique and pretty, if nothing else. Give it a try, and see if it suits your taste. If you aren’t sold by episode 5, it’s probably not going to be worth your time. But if you’re looking for something equal parts tender and intricate, this is a perfect choice.

    Flip Flappers is a show I didn’t initially care about as I just saw it as an average cutesy fantasy show. Magical girls, inter-dimensional journeys, cute aesthetics, these are things that the show possess that have been done before already. I wasn’t a fan of the cast at first as well. Most of the cast lack substance and the two main characters Cocona and Papika’s rollercoaster relationship annoyed me to death. However, I kept watching and every new journey that unfolds lead to new things that continually picked up my interest. It eventually peaked and came to the realization that this show proved that it has a lot of potential, albeit not all of them has come to fruition.   
The first thing that fascinated me is the visuals. They are just hypnotizing as we are presented the world of Pure Illusion and how it contrasts with the real world. The animation is good yet eccentric at times with its bright colors and fast-paced scene transitions, like a constant attempt to grab the viewer’s attention. It’s honestly the main reason I didn’t decide to drop the show early on, it’s just a well-done eye candy. 
The setting looks generic but it keeps on unveiling a lot of things, though gimmicky at times, as the main duo travels through the different faces of Pure Illusion. It helped me understand the characters better as it reflects the character’s perspective. Cocona sees it as a nuisance yet Papika sees it as an adventure. Yayaka sees it as a long-term mission and the rest of the cast sees it as a mystery. This conflict aided the strengthening of relationships especially the two main characters who seemingly fight all the time. 
As the show progressed in the second half, major revelations are being dropped one by one which caught me off-guard. The whole Pure Illusion started making sense with respect to what the objective of the story is. While I mostly received this as a positive thing, it’s also problematic since the show decided to suddenly go deep into the story when it’s been doing well episodically beforehand.  
Like mentioned before, the show has a lot of potential as it keeps opening these potential plot points by the episode. New aspects of the setting are being explored, the characters are starting to get fleshed out, and the story is starting to take flight with the real objective being uncovered. However, not all of them were addressed by the end of the show. There were a lot of questions and mysteries left to what the show was trying to offer. It’s like we are presented these tasty ingredients prepared to be transformed into a dish, but the product feels unfinished. Nevertheless, the story remains solid enough to not crumble on itself. 
Overall, Flip Flappers managed to go beyond my underwhelming first impression. It turned out to be one of the best shows this season had to offer. It’s a show recommended to those who like cute girls dealing with fantasy elements with a bit of personal edge to it. Well-presented, consistent, cutesy, heartwarming, I think I already written enough trying to describe how a surprising delight this show is despite addressing a considerable amount of issues but give it a shot anyway. It looks nothing special on the surface, but you might be in for a possible surprise.

    If something makes you happy, excited, or sets off another string of convoluted positive emotions, it’s kinda tough not to like. Hell, even things that makes you scared, anxious, or want to cry, emotions that seem negative in nature, are contributing factors to why you might like something. Think back to whenever someone tried to explain why they loved “Clannad: After Story” with “it made me cry,” or think back to whenever someone told you why they loved “Shingeki no Kyojin” with “I couldn’t stop looking at the screen!” The same can be applied to why people love those moe slice of life anime, it just makes them happy. It’s tough to beat emotion with logic, which is why Flip Flappers felt so damn successful. A world where anything could happen, the writers do what they want because they felt like it, not limiting themselves to a set of rules or principles, and goddamn, it was lovely. Every episode explored a new world, with new characters and a different sense of fun each and everytime. Flip Flappers understood perfectly well how to have a good time, and it was an absolute fucking blast to watch. 
However, all of the fun can easily be destroyed in the face of an underwhelming ending. Flip Flappers was shaping up to be a wonderful series, but a sudden shift from episodic fun to an attempt at establishing a serious story changed everything. You could certainly argue that the final arc was what they were going for the whole time, while everything else was filler, but the “filler” was still significantly better than the actual story. Somehow, even the absolutely gorgeous animation had suffered. In comparison to everything else, the final scenes looked underwhelming. This may seem like a silly criticism, but for a show that boasts visual beauty, it’s disappointing when that beauty fades. Even then, I wouldn’t mind if the story managed to stay on track, but it doesn’t. 
------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fun Beginnings 
Flip Flappers absolutely decimated my expectations. The cover screamed nothing more than another typical magical girl anime. However, it really is so much more. This series is about exploration, travelling beyond the unknown, and doing crazy things for the sake of fun. 
The series surrounds a middle school girl, Cocona, being carried away from her boring, mundane world by a very mysterious girl, Papika. Cocona gets introduced to this “portal” device that will allow her and Papika to travel to whatever world necessary in order to complete their objective. This objective is to obtain crystal shards, which Papika is having trouble gathering on her own, so she enlists Cocona to help her as best as she can. 
Even if you haven’t seen the series, it’s pretty clear that this is a setup for something of an episodic nature. At first, the focus was on Papika, Cocona, and their adventures (or perhaps misadventures) within all of these varying places. Every episode explored a new world, and each world possessed strikingly different themes in a wonderful attempt at originality. It’s hard to confine Flip Flappers to one genre, because it tries so many things over the course of its thirteen episodes. A few examples: 
There’s an episode where Papika ventures across a gorgeous orange desert in a battle to the death against a group of bandits. She was trying to protect a weak village of weak creatures, and when she squares off against their leader, she practically goes Super Saiyan, and you see the two zooming across the sky as if you’re watching Dragon Ball Z. This episode is clearly inspired by the super power genre.  
There’s an episode where Cocona and Papika have to pilot giant mechs and battle with other giant mechs over the backdrop of a gorgeous neon city, destroying most of that city in the process. This episode is clearly inspired by the mecha genre. 
There’s an episode where Cocona and Papika get trapped in a school, where doll-like figures with giant black holes for eyes follow them around telling them that all they want is to be their “friend.” This episode is clearly inspired by the horror genre. 
It was hard not to appreciate what the series was trying to do, as every time I clicked “next episode,” I knew I was in for new. This was an absolutely wonderful change from what I had been used to. I was simply in love in with this sense of adventure. 
However, Flip Flappers once again decimated my expectations, except this time it wasn’t in a positive sense. The last third tries to give us a real story. It tries to wrap up what it had set up, and it wants to leave us on a good note. I could understand this, as having the series stay episodic through and through was probably a scary thought, so the creators might’ve wanted to at least give it an ending. However, this final arc doesn’t manage to be as likable as the rest of the series, and it really destroyed some of the fun. 
Not-so-fun Endings 
Flip Flappers loses its charm when the creators shift the tone entirely. It tries to develop the characters backstories, give everything some kind of relevance, and they finally tell us what the hell is going on. There’s nothing wrong with what it was aiming for, but it just doesn’t work out the way I would have hoped. 
What had happened to Papika and Cocona in their lives is incredibly compelling, and genuinely got me excited. Seeing Papika’s relationship to Cocona’s mother, and how they were stripped away from each other in such a barbaric way gave me goosebumps. We also get an explanation on why they’re searching for these shards, who the people chasing Papika and Cocona are, and why Cocona’s life is the way it is. Everything was explained decently, and at the start of the serious arc, I was convinced that it would work out pretty well.  
However, where things start to get messy is when the series encroaches upon the conclusion. As Papika and Cocona draw closer, in an attempt to “save” each other, things become more about love, faith, and their “bond.” This sort of escapism might have worked before, in the mystical and whimsical portion of the series, but after giving us this serious, edgy, more depressing backdrop, all tension is diluted when it’s solved so inconsistently. The goosebumps faded away, and I was left with an empty feeling. It didn’t help that the animation started to take a serious hit. The final scenes felt underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the series. Not only the animation, but where all the previous fights were these epic unbelievable brawls, the final fight was more about hyping up a super-move of love to one-shot the final boss. Even if this was consistent with what the show was originally going for, the changing of the tone towards the end didn’t help that they decided to transition back into what they were originally going for out of nowhere. 
Even if you disregard this, it’s not like the serious arc was being handled too well to begin with. Sure, I liked some parts of it, but it didn’t change that the writing started to get a bit messy, characters were acting inconsistently, and the story felt underwhelming with its attempt to dramatize everything. Seeing Papika and Cocona go from lovely, fun personas to this serious bunch with edgy backstories felt out of place. I started to get used to it, but then it did a complete flip and they went back to what they originally were. It’s hard to be sure what to feel at this point, so all I could do was watch aimlessly. 
Flip Flappers starts out wonderfully, giving us a taste of pure fun for the sake of fun. It does whatever the hell it wants in an attempt to excite you, and it really works. Where things start to fail is when they try to create a darker story, characters, and tone. The serious arc is unfortunately very underwhelming. Although it isn’t bad, it never manages to be as fantastic as the series was beforehand. Flip Flappers really could’ve been something, and I’ll never stop being disappointed that it didn’t turn out the way I wanted.

    This show is amazing...if you liked Madoka or any generic anime that has an organization that won't tell the main character what they are doing or why they should be doing it until the last 2 episodes of the show. 
The show's atmosphere drips with the depressing normalcy of Cocona's life. She's a realistic shy high school/middle school girl who just wants to live her life in peace. UNFORTUNATELY, a random girl shows up named Papika, who is one of the most unrealistically cheerful and positive plot driving characters ever. If you like that type of character then this is definitely a fun ride, if you would prefer something more realistic, again Madoka like, then this show falls short. Papika might as well be immortal, or at least an inhuman freak who believes she is immune to death. Papika and Cocona are two of the lucky few who get to go to bizarre and amazingly inventive worlds the likes of which no one has seen since the Witch Labyrinths from MM...  
Although the worlds are more thought out and unique than MM, they lack a sense of purpose towards the greater plot and are just a showcase for whatever random thing popped into the animator's head that week. The two girls go to these worlds, which may be quite deadly, for no reason beyond curiosity and a prize that neither seems to care about.  They desire the greater goal of getting ""a wish"" but they barely care about the 10 or so pieces they need in order to actually get the wish. Once they learn the organization's overall goal, it becomes even more questionable why they would help out the organization beyond the fact that the story must happen or there will be no show. 
Character designs are very unique and purposefully cartoonish, allowing radical changes to their designs when going to different worlds. Unfortunately, the designs are easily the most interesting part of the characters. The art style of their shaded eyes reveal their lack of complexity and failures compared to MM. You might believe there's depth beyond their standard girlish antics, but in reality the character's emotions range from super excited to depressingly sad with nothing but boredom in-between. 
The story obviously is just going to string the audience along until the story becomes darker and darker where the leader of the organization reveals his wish that he wants to achieve and the girls must use the power of their love for each other to overcome whatever the ""adults"" have chosen to believe is the superior ideology.  There is an evil organization. They are barely explored and are basically just the villains from the anime Evangelion and Darling in the Franxx.(hooded figures who want to rule/warp the planet into their own ideal world bla bla bla) 
It is above the traditional, generic magical girl series, but only just barely and I pity anyone who has much higher hopes than a 6/10 for the show's run. 
To be fair, this is probably more like a 5/10, but my standards for stories right now are to at least break previous ideas of the genre and go in a direction that might be better than the ones before it.  For that reason I dropped it to a 3/10.  You need more than a unique art style to push the boundaries of what's expected in new anime.

    What started as a zany romp through intriguing worlds turned into a cliched story. Helicopter parenting is bad and when you try to protect your kid from everything it turns out *you're* the one hurting them! Only in Flip Flappers case the helicopter mom force feeds LSD to everyone to the point where the show turns into Inception and you're not supposed to know what's reality and what's Pure Illusion. It takes a lot of cues from Evangelion and that may be up your alley but it's not my thing. 
The animation stays consistent in its style but there is a slight drop off in quality as the show progresses. Music is fine, there are a few stand out track but the OP and ED stand out more than music used within the show.  
As far as characters go Papika is stagnant, Cocona goes through the standard 'I didn't want to do this/adventure but now because of friends I do!' arc complete with angst in the middle for ""conflict"", and Yayaka learns the true meaning of friendship. Pretty standard stuff all around. Salt isn't a character until the last 4 episodes, Nyunyu just never is a character, the twins (triplets?) don't amount to much but I suppose they had a slight character arc. The best episode in the show in my opinion was centered around a character whose name I can't remember because she was the focus of only that episode and then disappeared for the rest of the show and was only seen in the end as a nod to the fact that they took the time to design a character, remember? 
Overall pretty standard stuff, I was really excited for it in the beginning but it tripped over itself in the end and crossed the finish line in mediocrity.

    It's painful to see a show with boundless imagination be constrained by the cold, harsh facts like Flip Flappers. It's a beautifully animated show with an endearing, infectious sort of charm, but BD sales are the lifeblood of seasonal anime, and all the charm in the world won't count for anything if you can't make the grade. Flip Flappers struggled to find an audience, and you could feel the creators; mad-dash scramble to wrap everything by the end of the first and certainly only season. 
If given the chance to stretch its legs and take its time, perhaps over two full-length seasons, I think Flip Flappers could have developed into something really marvelous. The chance for anything like that now, however, is pure illusion. 
Flip Flappers has a great start. The artwork and animation is gorgeous throughout, full of liveliness and energy, capturing everything from fantastical dreamscapes to heated battles to the subtle, little gestures that are so often forgotten. That and the intrigue of the setting and the characters was enough to draw me in. I kept watching for the varied worlds each episode would offer; it reminded me of Space Dandy in that each setting felt like a chance for different artists to go hog wild and really let loose. Papika and Cocona are likable leads to boot, which always helps. 
Something I also appreciated was the show's slavish devotion to showing, not telling. There's no narration, no characters explaining every step of their thought process (at first), it's all conveyed through the visuals and the way these characters interact. That can be all too rare in anime and should be applauded. 
Unfortunately, the last third of the show starts to cram in plot point after plot point, as if the crew realized that they were running out of time. We stop exploring these distant worlds and instead have to drudge through the tedious, infinitely-less interesting backstory. Characters show up with no purpose (NyuNyu). The characters we already have are pretty thin, with little depth or nuance to really explore. We have yet another ""small child with reality warping powers of a god running amok"" plot. Then the whole thing ends with so many threads unresolved at best or completely forgotten about at worst; Yayaka, who's friendship with Cocona is the basis for a powerful turning point in Ep 8, is almost entirely redundant by the end and gets no conclusion to her arc. The story doesn't end, it just stops. 
It's a shame that a rushed end can damage an otherwise good or even great show, but that's why execution is so, so important. 
All that being said, don't take this 6 to mean its bad. I would still heartily recommend Flip Flappers as a whole; it's breathtaking to look at and, at its best, it's a wildly fun and imaginative ride. You just have to take the show warts and all.

    Have you ever felt like a show was made just for you? One that, in spite of all its flaws, you can see some good in it? Flip Flappers is this to me. 
Flip Flappers is fun, original and refreshing. Believe me, watching the first episode and seeing Papika surfing in the air with her hoverboard is extremely refreshing from a lot of LN derivatives and High School Garbage I've the displeasure of wasting my time on.  
Then there is the superb animation, the surprisingly memorable musical scores, and the vibrant colors ties everything together for a splendid 20 minute episode of fun. 
The plot is fresh and imaginative, although watching this over the course of several weeks ended up making me hype this show up, I still appreciated the ending and overall plot in this series. It'll make you laugh, make you cry, and make you scream. It's one of the very few shows where I ended up liking most of the characters in it.  
Adding to that, the show has a surprising amount of rewatch value, little details don't get noticed unless you pay close attention and the show actually rewards keen viewers. 
If there are any missteps, it's due to the pacing. Early episodes were slow but later episodes had erratic pacing. I would have preferred if the show was a 2-cour series, it would greatly fix most problems I have with the pacing. 
And what can I say? It's a great ride and I'm glad to be on it. 
It is the best I've felt since watching FLCL.

    Papika and Cocona. Remember those two names well. Flip Flappers chronicles the adventure of these two girls as they venture into a world known as the “Pure Illusion”. For a girl like Cocona, this is a dramatic change of her life. Think about it though. If you certainly got dragged into a world of unknown, wouldn’t you be curious, scared, or excited? Those are the sort of feelings I was expecting this show at first. It’s expecting the unexpected. 
As an original anime, viewers need not to worry about faithfulness related to adaptation. Also, director Oshiyama Kiyotaka puts his talent to work. For those who are unfamiliar with his resume, he’s been involved with various projects pertaining with sci-fi elements. (ex. Space Dandy, Bounen no Xamdou, etc) As such, you should expect to see plenty of expressive ideas and creativity that he pours into Flip Flappers. The first few episodes seems to also draw influences from fairy tales such as Alice in Wonderland. However, the story itself is much different as the Pure Illusion world brings unnatural ideas to reality. The basic concept is two girls working for a mysterious “Flip Flap” organization in order to collect amorphous fragments. These fragments are implied to have the power to grant wishes.  
I have to admit, watching Flip Flappers began as nothing short but exciting. My original impression was something along the line of a magical girl series of cute girls doing cute things while trying to accomplish a goal together. That quickly evolved as we see how action packed this show can really be. The third episode will leave you in awe as the audience will be presented with a spectacular battle. It adds elements that can draw similarity from other popular works such as Mad Max or Fist of the North Star. For this reason, Flip Flappers breaks the mold of the usual cute girls doing cute things but derives into more of a surrealistic adventure. That adventure takes place mainly in the Pure Illusion world where many creative ideas are used. What makes their adventure special is that while it can feel crazy and wild at times, it retains the strengths of storytelling and at the same time updating it for today’s audiences. The storytelling also gets more complex as we learn more about the main characters (specifically their past) and connections to the Pure Illusion world. The supernatural phenomenon and purpose of the characters will also be realized that easily can draw the viewers’ curiosity frequently. 
Of course, Flip Flappers can’t shine without its characters. That’s where our main protagonists, Papika and Cocona comes in. Papika and Cocona are sort of polar opposites on side of a coin. Cocona is a pretty serious girl who seems somewhat insecure about her future. She attends a school but is often cautious about people and events around her. It seems that she is often careful about letting others get close to her. This is the opposite for Cocona, a highly energetic girl who seems to be very interested in Cocona. The two develops a unique relationship as they explore the Pure Illusion world in all its glory. What I find most interesting about their relationship goes beyond just a charming character chemistry. Rather, it’s how Papika’s influence seems to change Cocona. She becomes livelier, sheds her initial reservations, and better express her emotions to others. It’s also hinted at many times that Cocona seems to view Papika as much more than just a friend. To me, her character goes under heavy changes as she begins to realize her purpose in the world.  Remember, she was very unsure about her future but finds purpose through her character connection with Papika. On the other hand, there’s Papika, the girl that always wants to get close with Cocona. She naturally tries to become her friend from the very start despite Cocona’s cautious personality. From my point of view, she is like the light of that Cocona is searching for in a dark tunnel. She is able to open Cocona’s eyes to a brighter future.  
Besides Papika and Cocona, we are also introduced to other characters in the show. Yayaka (Cocona’s childhood friend) is perhaps the most prominent one among those introduced as she has a past history with Cocona. However, the most intriguing part is how her role in the show also has influences on Cocona. The way this show adapts character drama becomes more and more emotional as time goes on. Now, what I do have some concern with is the later stages of the series as more revelations regarding Cocona is revealed and those that gets involved in her life. The antagonist in this show may or may not be likable for their roles. It’s also easy to say that while I do enjoy the character drama, it can sometimes feel a bit forced and thrown into the face of the audience. However, one thing is for sure. It’s still pretty convincing way to explore human emotions. Jealousy, regret, apathy, compassion, loneliness, love, shame, acceptance are just a few of those.  
Produced by studio 3Hz, I have to admit, the show feels like something out of a fairy book when it comes to visual dynamics. It gives a very picturesque feeling with its setting that sharply contrasts between the real world and the Pure Illusion world. In fact, fairy tale allusions enter the show itself such as with the animal motifs and stylistic dresses. As more episodes progresses, there’s even mecha that enters the story! That being said, the show’s risks paid off for its visual quality and is more than just about being symbolic or unique. It’s there to show that Flip Flappers stands out as a show on its own merits. Character designs and transformations may seem like a generic magical girl theme but retain its surrealistic expression. Speaking of expressions, characters convey that exceptionally well to display their emotions. Cocona is a prime example as this as she is the most human character in the show while Papika’s goofy personality makes the series more relaxing and playful to watch. As I mentioned before, the battle segments in this show is fast paced yet precisely crafted. Think of it similar to FLCL or Gurren Lagann as it displays the talented directing of the staff. When in motion, it’s when the action really becomes epic. There’s also some fan service (namely an episode with swimsuits) but that really shouldn’t hold you back from watching the show. 
The soundtrack and music offers a unique dynamic to the show as well. In particular, the ED theme song highlights the talent of Kiyotaka Oshiyama’s directing as the lyrics has a balanced rhythm. The OST also offers a good balance between intense battle segments to the more emotional dialogues. This comes with character voice mannerism that is impressively performed by the voice actresses. I’m mostly impressed at the two main leads – Cocona and Papika. The two are able to deliver their lines in such a believable way that it’s just hard to ever turn heads away from them. I mean, who can ignore their iconic “Flip Flapping!” line? 
Ah Flip Flappers, an underrated gem that some people may have overlooked this year. It’s a series that brings fantasy to a surrealistic level in a world of unimaginable possibilities. The characters play their roles in a fashion that has meaningful purpose while always arousing the curiosity of the audience. Storytelling may or may not suit your tastes but I’d still advise in giving this show a chance. It’s too fun to pass up on as it proves creativity at its finest.

    I remember discovering Flip Flappers in the fall 16 anime season and I immediately fell in love with it. It was a fantastic coming of age story that had great characters, beautiful and unique visuals and a funky soundtrack. It was so good that I put Flip Flappers in my top 10 anime to come out from this decade. 
Fast forward to 2019 where this decade of anime is reaching to a close I decided to re-watch Flip Flappers just to see it's truly worthy of being in my top 10 favourite animes from this decade along with stuff like March Comes in Like a Lion, Hunter x Hunter 2011, Little Witch Academia TV and The Ancient Magus Bride. 
As a middle school student, Cocona has been trying to decide what to do with her life. Magical girl, however, wasn't a career path that she'd ever considered. When suddenly a strange girl named Papika thrusts her into a secret organisation called Flip Flap Conona's outlook does a radical flip-flop. Her views start to chance when she gets dragged by Papika into an alternate dimension called pure illusion where she's charged with gathering crystal shards and facing off strange creatures from various alternate dimensions with the aid of Papika. 
On the surface, Flip Flappers looks like you standard throwaway magical girl show from 2006 but when you actually watch the series especially past the first episode you begin to see how special and unique Flip Flappers is. At its core Flip Flappers is a coming of age and adventure tale that features pretty colours, charming characters and attractive symbolism. 
The journey aspect of flip flappers while not revolutionary is unique. 
The first half of Flip Flappers is like watching two cute girls going on a journey travelling to various worlds, interacting with the set world, learning various life lessons and returning into the own world as different people. This is easily the best part of Flip Flappers story because not only the show was capable of using it's coming of age elements with its captivating symbolism that synthesise well with the narrative but it also brings out a lot of core themes and messages that strengths the characterisation for Conona and Papika. 
The second third is for the most part similar to the first third however it started to introduce its core themes and story elements to the mix. Not to mention this is where Flip Flappers comes full on character-driven series putting its episodic structure in the bench. There are a lot of themes that Flip Flappers explored like growing up, puberty, understanding one another, and sexuality and these's were masterfully executed in the anime. 
If you are a Yuri fan then Flip Flappers would be your cup of tea. It has a lot of Yuri elements that only strengthens the show's core themes thanks to great direction and writing. 
Despite Flip Flappers being one of the more unique coming of age stories from this decade of anime, it has one major flaw that prevented Flip Flappers from being one of the all-time greats from this decade and that is the final third aka episodes 9-13. 
Spoilers aside from the series kinda lost of what it so special in the first place. The shows tried to introduce a lot of new plot elements that weren't explored in the earlier episodes but these new plot elements, unfortunately, fell flat on its face thanks to the lacklustre episode count which is not enough to flesh out the new story elements in the narrative. 
To the final third's credit, the ending itself was satisfying as it was able to tie up most of the loose ends. Plus the character development for Cocona, Papika and especially Yakaya in the final third is incredible completely overshadowing most of the issues that I had in the final third. 
Since Flip Flappers is a coming of age tale, the main characters must be great and interesting to justify the narrative and themes? Lucky the main characters in Flip Flappers were fantastic and well thought out from start to finish. 
Conona is an example of a coming of age protagonist done right. She starts off as a shy and cautious person who doesn't know what to do in life thanks to her lack of social skills that prevented her to socialise with anyone apart from her grandmother and Yakaya. 
As the series progresses as Conona spends more time with Papika travelling into various worlds in pure illusion she becomes more social and confident to others. 
While Conona is a greatly written coming of age protagonist, she pales in comparison to the energetic and lovable Papika. 
She is my favourite character in Flip Flappers. 
On first glance, she appears to your usual girl who is the thirst of adventure. She has no sense of danger and has little understanding of personal boundaries that put people off but as the series, progress Papika not only starts being a more reliable person thanks to great character development. 
The best part about Conona and Papika as characters is how strong their character chemistry. At the beginning of the series, Conona didn't care less about Papika but as the series progresses they understand one other thanks to brilliant character interactions and by the end, you really feel that these two are unbreakable. 
While Cocona and Papika were great and well-developed characters, I cannot say a thing for the same thing for the supporting characters. They were not bad characters but at they were pretty forgettable then again that's expected from a coming of age story that is partially focused on a handful of characters but it would have been cool to see some supporting characters get a moment in the spotlight. 
The one expectation of this is with Yayaka. Despite being part of a rival/villain organisation she a nicely written character that I loved from start to finish. Her development is a strong as Conona and Papika. 
Flip Flappers visually can be best described as a firework factory that is filled with pretty and vibrant colours. The various world's that Conona and Papika were beautifully crafted as they all have their own identity. The various colour palettes for the background scenery Characters designs were unique and appealing to look at. 
My praise for art doesn't end there. For starters, I really love how Conona and Papika have swapped hair colours when they transform. 
Then there's the symbolism which is easily the second best things for Flip Flappers.  
Without getting into heavy spoiler territory I found the show use of symbolism to be very clever. 
From the change of colour contrast, character movement, imagery and great shot composition the show was able to communicate its narrative and themes through visual storytelling. The only other shows that I saw visuals storytelling done experimentally well is Utena, Penquindrum and Yuri Kuma all works directed by the very talented Kunihiko Ikuhara. 
The glorious art is only made better of how smooth, dynamic and crisp the animation is. 
You can tell the staff were fans of Gainax and Trigger as almost every fight has that Trigger/Gainax flavour. 
As much I love Flip Flappers visuals there was one thing that kinda bothered me and that's the fan-service. 
Fan-service isn't necessarily bad, but, the way the Flip Flappers uses it was pretty distracting. Frequent butts, tights and crotch shots mess up certain key moments in the series.  
This wouldn't be such a problem if the characters were not middle school. I understand that puberty is one of the show themes and all but did we need weird and awkward fan-service? I don't think so. 
The best word to describe the soundtrack for Flip Flappers is adventurous. Done by the underrated talented music group TO-MAS the score does a fantastic job at capturing the adventurous and mysterious tone of Flip Flappers thanks to the nice choice of upbeat, mysterious, electronic and sci-fi tracks that play in the anime. 
The opening theme Serendipity by ZAQ is a great opening that fits the anime perfectly. 
The ending theme FLIP FLAP FLIP FLAP by TO-MAS feat Chima is one of the best anime ending themes I ever heard in an anime thanks to its catchy and happy nature that masterfully closes an episode of Flip Flappers well. 
Audio-wise Flip Flappers is very good that features a lot of talented voice actors for both languages. 
If I had to pick dub or the original Japanese audio it would pick the dub as it is not only it's one of Sentai Filmworks dubs, in general, the dub actually fitted the show better. 
Add this up with the strong performances by Luci Christian (Papika) and Brittney Karbowski (Conona) and you got yourself a great dub especially for Sentai Filmworks standards. 
Flip Flappers is one of the best and unique coming of age tales I have seen in a long while. The rich thematic exploration charming characters mixed in with splendid soundtrack and the fascinating production values really make Flip Flappers one kind of a series even with its couple of handfuls of flaws from the underdeveloped final third (despite having a lot of good moments) and the shotty use of fan-service. 
Regardless Flip Flappers is still one of the best animes I have seen from this decade but it's sadly no longer in my top 10 as it is now comfortably sitting in my top 30 rather in my top 10. 
Flip Flappers is a beautiful ride that I will never forget. 
Thank you Studio 3Hz and the staff for making this near perfect journey possible.

    While browsing for some shows that I might watch this Fall season, I stumbled on this one, got curious on the visuals, I watched the promotional video on it although I found the synopis too vague that time and I thought to myself ""This show has potential"" and it came the pilot episode. 
Flip Flappers, the show that most of the people overlooked because of the number of magical girl shows this Fall 2016 season has brought. What I liked on this show was it's subtle yet too vibrant and how it was incorporated with meanings behind it that you will not notice 23 minutes had already passed. Graced with beautiful art design, engaging characters,and some of the most consistently sharp visual storytelling, episodic themes where at times calm and subdued then comes a bombastic outing, even crazier and bigger in its scale it manages to break away from easy comparisons thanks to a tone, aesthetic, and narrative ideas that are so unique and engaging. Flip Flappers’ storytelling and character writing goes completely unsaid. It's strong point was both character story and adventure , but it stands out as a confident, imaginative, and consistently beautiful example of visual storytelling done right.

    Critics call this series: ""beautiful, imaginative, action-packed, and mysterious"" 
I'll add that it's also ""diverse, unique, immersive, and, most importantly, it's (*cough*cough* mostly *cough*) coherent!"" 
Flip Flappers is pretty underrated and will take you on a relatively unpredictable journey with two middle school girls named Papika and Cocona as they travel to another dimension called ""Pure Illusion"". The story begins mysteriously as it follows the warm and simple-minded Papika as she escapes from what looks like a lab and flies off into the night sky on her hoverboard. It then switches to the perspective of the visibly depressed or kuudere Cocona and briefly gives insight into her struggles to figure who she wants to be and what career path to choose. At this point, no one could have guessed the incredibly diverse future that was in store for these two protagonists. 
TL;DR at the end 
I strongly believe that Flip Flappers is one of the most original and imaginative anime ever made. It should get more attention because it definitely has all of the necessary ingredients to become one of the treasured gems of the anime genre. I highly recommend that you check this out if you enjoy diversity, unpredictability, action, and beauty. I usually like to contemplate anime, but this series was so unpredictable and silly that I had to turn my brain off for most of it, haha!  
The concept of other dimensions gave this anime the ability to explore unlimited possibilities. Mechas, ghosts, sci-fi, action, comedy, horror--- you name it and it was probably in Flip Flappers. The overarching plot showcases the growing friendship of Papika and Cocona as they journey to ""Pure Illusion"" to collect rock-like-things that grant a wish once collected (kind of like finding the dragon balls). They eventually come to face opposition from another group that's also trying to collect them. However, ~PLOT TWIST~ things aren’t really as they seem… What real-world consequences will their actions in Pure Illusion have? Do the rocks really grant wishes? Who, exactly, is Papika? In fact, who is Dr. Salt?  In fact... who... are you...? Just kidding, but these are some of the major questions that you might wonder throughout this anime. Overall, I did think it was a bit random (mostly in a good way) and sometimes the randomness strayed from the coherence of the plot. However, the pacing was, nonetheless, great and the stories/sub-stories were all interesting as well.   
Although the art was mostly simple, it was beautifully simple. The art was deliberately made to look simple and is one of the most colorful anime that I’ve seen. It was truly a work of art! The motion was a bit choppy at times, but you could really FEEL the action. Pure illusion (alternate dimension) was absolutely stunning with rich and vibrant colors, and its artwork was enough to make me feel fully immersed in this series. The art wasn’t good because of its detail, but instead because of its creativity. They did a great job on setting the moods of the diverse settings in Flip Flappers. Sometimes it goes from a fun and light-hearted mood to a sci-fi mood, and then to more darker moods. Although the art was really good, I never once thought “Oh... My... Fuck... BRILLIANCE! MASTERPIECE!” like I did for Unlimited budgetworks (unlimited bladeworks) or Kizumoneygatari (Kizumonogatari) so I couldn't give it a 10 (Visit Kill la Kill or Katanagatari [10/10 Art]) for how to be flambuoyant, but still fluid in animation) 
Sound: 9/10  
Every character’s voice matched the character, battle sounds were great, and background noises were normal. The background OSTs were primarily cinematic and didn’t have a memorable central theme like in Fairy tail, Kill la Kill, Guilty Crown, SAO, Madoka Magica, or Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles but it was nonetheless great background music. The opening was pretty good, but the ending was perfect for this anime. The ending was lighthearted, had an Alice-in-Wonderland-like feeling to it, and the artwork really matched the music perfectly. The sound was great overall.  
Character: 6/10  
I personally think the characters were the weakest part of this anime. All of the characters were cliche tropes that weren’t complex at all. The story was diverse enough that it didn’t matter much, but none of the characters were particularly unique in any way. It’s fine because I’m not sure how they could’ve developed more complex characters with its diverse settings in a matter of only 12 episodes. Their simplicity didn’t really take much away from the anime, but you probably won’t be getting any new favorites from it. 
I really enjoyed this anime. It was pretty unique, so I think I’ll remember it for a long time. I enjoyed it enough to watch it again someday! That doesn’t happen to me often (I’ve only really re-watched like 2 series). There was just something special about this anime that I haven’t seen elsewhere. 
TL;DR 
It was very unique, the story was pretty good, and it was interesting overall, but it could have been better. The story was also extremely diverse but consequently had some very minor inconsistencies. The artwork was creative, but a bit choppy. The sound was great and well-suited to this anime, but not amazing.  
Should you watch this anime? Well, I totally recommend it personally but: 
If you value anime for its uniqueness, then definitely! 
If you like artistic anime, then yeah! 
If you like girl action anime, then yep! 
If you like sci-fi anime, then ehhh you might want to give it a shot... 
If you found the story or concept to be intriguing, then you should probably try it for about three episodes... 
If you dislike simple anime and tropes, then no because this anime is very simple and trope heavy.

    Flip Flappers is the textbook definition of a hidden gem. A short, artistic original anime by a relatively unknown studio, and also an anime which is quite difficult to explain. This is partially because of its symbolic themes, but also because the execution itself is very unorthodox. It is like the anime equivalent of an LSD trip; something I can only describe as a crossover of FLCL and Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita. But somehow, Studio 3Hz actually made it work, resulting in what I would probably have to consider my favorite anime of Fall 2016. 
The story follows two girls who meet each other by coincidence: the extremely energetic and cheerful Papika, and the much more level-headed and all-round normal Cocona. The somewhat futuristic world which Flip Flappers plays out in does not only contain hoverboards and advanced robotics, but also a fair amount of less explainable things. Supposedly there exists a second, overlapping dimension called Pure Illusion which Papika and Cocona end up stumbling upon by literally falling down a hole into it. This other world is largely responsible for what makes Flip Flappers so different, because in Pure Illusion pretty much anything seems possible. It reminds me of Fantasia a bit with its magical, colourful landscapes, mythical beasts and other strange creatures, doors functioning as teleports, and just a ton of magic in general. Sometimes however it can be sci-fi-esque rather than fantasy-esque, with digital Tron-like cyberspace environments, mechas and more. 
Papika and Cocona work for the Flip Flap organization, which tasks them with searching for so-called ""amorphous"" fragments within the world of Pure Illusion, which are supposedly capable of granting wishes. These fragments can be found in different kinds of environments within Pure Illusion, which is largely what causes them to end up in such blatantly different surroundings in almost every episode. In their adventures however they end up finding out that Flip Flap is not the only organization on the hunt for amorphous fragments, as they encounter a second group who seemingly wants them for their own ulterior motives. And thus we end up with a lot of fighting in-between the two sides throughout the anime as they keep trying to beat each other to the punch for every fragment. 
Flip Flappers utilizes the strange world of Pure Illusion in order to tell unusual stories on a mostly episodic basis out of chronological order, and on top of providing interesting adventures it also has a plethora of symbolism underneath the surface. Pretty much everything in this show has a meaning. However, not the entire anime is on an episodic basis. Towards the end, everything starts to connect, and an overarching storyline you might not have even realized was ever there suddenly starts to become visible. Ultimately, it all culminates into a quite grandiose and conclusive ending. 
But what really makes Flip Flappers a success to me is that it manages to deliver its deeper messages without it really hampering the fun factor of the anime itself. A common problem I have with more philosophical anime is that they often end up feeling like nothing more than lectures and either turn out to be quite boring (like Mushishi) or just plain cringey (like Yuri Kuma Arashi). But Flip Flappers is actually a ton of sheer light-hearted fun on top of its subtle themes, like a child's imagination come to life with its execution, and even though there is generally way more to each scene than meets the eye, it is still very entertaining to watch. And as a result it actually made me interested enough in the show as a whole to motivate me to pay attention to the details as well, so in a way the fun factor actually made the deeper themes better too. It is the same reason you usually learn more from a class you actually enjoy than one that makes you literally fall asleep. 
The characters are overall quite likable but also very symbolic. Papika's bubbly personality is like a representation of childhood innocence, whereas another girl called Yayaka rather seems to symbolize adulthood, with Cocona stuck somewhere in-between the two extremes, unsure what she really wants to do. It's a nice way of combining character diversity with contrasting deeper themes. 
The production value is also quite surprising. Studio 3Hz do not have much in their repertoire other than Dimension W and Sora no Method prior to this, but even so they still definitely delivered here. The art style looks incredibly hand-drawn, like something you would normally see in a Studio Ghibli film rather than something you would expect to see airing on TV. But it fits really well with the Fantasia-like setting of Pure Illusion, further enhancing the experience of magic and wonder of it all. And on top of that, Flip Flappers boasts with not just having one of the best opening themes of the entire season, but also quite frankly one of the best ending themes I've ever heard in anime. 
Overall, what you have is an anime which honestly does not feel like it has any clear weaknesses in my eyes. The unorthodox setting and story, the way all the dots suddenly connect towards the end, the diverse and symbolic characters, the gorgeous art and the enjoyable theme songs, it is all really good. Just... not utterly amazing either. I guess the biggest downside would be that at times the story will undoubtedly come across as rather confusing, even if you really try to pay attention. Granted, this is all intentional, but that does not really help much in practicality. However, as mentioned earlier, even if you will not understand literally every message that Flip Flappers is trying to convey, I think you should still be able to enjoy it quite a lot. When it all comes down to it, that is probably its greatest strength.

    To be honest Flip Flappers should-be more popular. I felt that it had all the material needed to engage with audiences regardless of their preferences, and most importantly sell great merchandise. The only thing that stopped me from giving the incredible piece of art a solid 10 was the strange and often times confusing story; which I'll get into in a moment so please keep sitting in your chair, or levitating above, you wizards. 
So what is Flip Flappers about? Why should you be watching it? Can you eat it? Only two of the three questions above will be answered. 
Flip Flappers’ story is interesting in many ways. We follow the lives two cute girls, there’s intense action, amazing visuals, a yuri undertone lurking. What more could you want— other than nudity, perv.  
The Story can be hit or miss depending on your preferences. If you’re into simple story-telling and plot developments then Flip flappers most likely won’t be on your watch list. The plot, the real plot, not fan-service is very confusing at times. It is so bad to the point where I found myself questioning “what the hell going on?” in certain episodes. You see, Flip Flappers method of storytelling is hard to follow…  
There are often times too many distractions, mostly imagery, that if you miss a single detail then you will be momentarily confused as to what is happening in the story. This is extremely prevalent when there are scenes filled to the brim with dialogue and monologues. Personally, I found myself getting lost in the vibrant imagery or special effects while characters were talking. Now as far as the story telling goes, the “direction” I have to say that I strongly believe that both the narrative was straight forward as to be expected. Flip Flappers method of storytelling is “the hero’s journey.” For example, think of movies like Harry potter or Lord of the rings.  
For those who are unfamiliar with the scenario, something bad or out of the ordinary happens. This causes the girls to go on an adventure to solve the problem; they receive supernatural aid, and get just a bit of character development. As their adventure progresses, they run into the antagonist whom they proceed to do battle with. At this point, “death & rebirth” kicks in. The girls lose, but suddenly realize that this battle is important, plot armor kicks in, and they both gain some sort of supernatural ability that helps them defeat the antagonist. After the grueling battle rests, a predictable outcome, the heroes succeed and head back home where everything is nice and happy. 
Now with “the journey “that the girls go on. It is not incredible but it sure is unique. During the span of the entire series Papika and Cocnoa are involved in some type of journey that teaches them both lessons. For example they both need each other. They’re friends! Most of the problems the two have to fix during the series, I perceived them as stepping blocks for the two to continue building their budding relationship. 
There’s never a dull moment in the Flip Flappers’ story I feel like it provided more than enough entertainment. 
At first glance, depending on if you have a good eye or are just really experienced with watching anime. One would assume Gainax worked this title with its unique choices in art. However, they didn’t (as far as my knowledge goes) do much in the animation department. The credits in episode 11 say that they were used for outsourcing. This is common in the anime industry. Personally I believe that their unique art style was used as inspiration for 3hz.  
Backgrounds are beautiful despite lacking detail and high quality at times. Character designs are unique, cute which is most important. On the other hand, the animation wasn’t as impressive. I felt like there could’ve been improvements to the aesthetics and quality to make the show look more modern. HOWEVER! And Honestly, I think everything worked out. I enjoyed the beauty the show had to offer. It has a sort of “dreamscape” fantasy design to it. This choice fits with the theme of the show. Lastly, the colors are rich and the special effects are fluid. 
The soundtrack does an excellent job setting the mood for certain situations. I felt that the composer did a wonderful job of creating songs that fit theme of the show. Happy, jaunty, tunes, the bells are of course the most important part. Voice acting was good to say the least. I didn't feel like the actors were anything special. The opening and ending song... Scratch the opening song. The ending song perfectly describes what the show is about! the sound director deserves to be acknowledge for their contributions to the show. 
Enjoyment & Overall: Flip flappers deserves some notoriety for its great efforts and contributions to the fall 2016 season. I felt that this title was incredibly fun to watch! The characters, art, soundtrack and story. There was so many things that I liked in the show that made it enjoyable. I had to give Flip Flappers a solid 9/10 because of how great I felt watching everything unfold.

    What's to say? 
Aloof schoolgirl gets kidnapped by a bats### crazy magical lesbian girl on a hoverboard who REALLY likes her to explore nightmare parallel universes/dream worlds at great threat to their own safety, sanity, and mental health. 
There's imagery of nightmares, ruined childhoods, pet rabbits who go all rage mode, Mad Max,  fountain orgies... wait what? Anyway they're to go to these worlds for some reason, collect their crystallized essence, try not to die or irreparably harm the psyche of their friends in the process, and fight the Klan. 
Yes, the Klan. 
As in Ku Klux, those guys with the hoods who have their own magical guy/girls. I wasn't really sure what the Klan was up to lately--seems they've branched out. 
This is supposed to somehow make sense but comes across as if Kill la Kill and FLCL had a baby that didn't get enough oxygen. Oh, and you'll be singing the closing theme whether you want to or not, that thing is an ear worm. 
Yes, I'm sure there's meaning to all that imagery and the pop culture references can be maddening at times, but honestly they're trying too hard to be everything at once (magical girl deconstruction, concept anime, coming of age, an exploration of the mind/madness) and have managed to out Gainax Gainax in the end.

    First off, im going to start by saying that for the first time i watched this anime, i got pretty much surprised. i decided to watch this just out of curiosity and didn't even expect anything from it. but the first episode actually surprised the hell out of me. and i will give my reasons as of why, and what surprised me. 
The story to be honest, it looks kinda targeted for kids to me but it feels not at the same time. there is a gap between those two and that's where the story is. i said it's not targeted for kids or at least teens at the same time cause of the combination with the animation. i feel like the animation made it so that person above, let's say 15 or 19 can enjoy this show too. And what makes the story looks different is because of the serious element in the story itself. usually, story that only targeted for kinds, well you know, it's just a normal story. more like fairy tale story. with out any serious problem or complicated problems but Flip flappers is actually have some of them. especially regarding the main character. even i got a bit surprised when they revealed everything about the main character backstory. so, i think overall, the story is really well made. although, i think the conclusion isn't really that impressive. it's just a normal ending imo. i only got impressed with the plot revelation. from that point, i think the show got really serious and pretty deep.  
but i must say, the story has one mistakes. they didn't put any details about the supernatural elements. maybe more like world building ? i kinda feel like, with not doing that, there are some people who want to know about it so badly, but to me, regardless, i think it's great to not putting more details about it. so that it can gives a mystery elements from the story. and it will remain as a mystery even the story ends. i like that kind of story so i love it a lot. 
The character. i think the character are amusing and interesting. when it comes to character. i don't really know much what to talks about it tbh. one thing that i must say, it's so catchy to the story and animation. overall, it think it has a very good characters. 
Sound! just loved to the opening and ending song a lot. i didn't pay a lot more attention with the soundtrack tho cause i was pretty serious with the story xD but the opening and ending song are really the best imo. catchy with the show too.  
The animation and character design. This one, is one of the thing which surprised me a lot from flip flappers. i didn't expect, a single tiny bit, that the animation would looked like what usually studio trigger or gainax made. this is one of the thing which got me excited with this show too. the animation looked awsome. this is rare tbh to me. this kind of show, having the kind of animation which is on the same level like one punch man. it isn't the character design but the animation. as for the character design, it's more like rough imo, but in a good way. which when they made it into an action scene, they just nailed it a lot.  
So, from overall view, this anime is a rare one from 2016. the story was really interesting and always get me thinking ""what the fuck is going on?"" and made me want to watch more and want to know what's next. moreover, the animation always made me excited. they start the show with a good song and end it with a pretty nice song too. really like the set up. great show overall. 9/10  
this show felt like a disney show to me xD  
generic ? full of cliche ? cgdct ? yuri ? at first you will think like that but when they gave you the backstory or revealed everything, that view will changed i think. only it just looks like magical girls but they don't even state that it's a magical girl so...yeah...i think they are using it to look more entertaining and i think they nailed it. at least to me tho. i don't know about everyone.  
if you are searching for new stuff, i will recommend this show. 
Hope my review can be helpful to you. 
Thanks. Have a nice day :D

    Flip Flappers: One of the few anime I have watched where every episode, I say, ""wow....."" and wondered what was going to happen next.  
Story: 6/10  
The story follows two girls, Cocona and Papika, and their journeys through Pure Illusion. It is a magical girl anime where they transform into the ""Flip Flappers,"" but it is not the magical girl element that is the focus, but the common themes associated with the genre, with friendship as the main theme. The girl's friendship is tested time and time again, and every time they go to Pure Illlusion, we learn more about their and their bond. 
Unfortunately, the main storyline suffers from being quite subtle. For an anime with heavy imagery, it favors having the audience put everything together over keeping a straight storyline. The main plot isn't introduced until the second half, and many of the characters are put in the background in favor of the main three characters, Cocona, Papika, and Yayaka. I felt that characters such as the twins and the ""evil organization"" had little time to develop and play any sort of significant role in the story.  
Character: 5/10  
I loved the characters, but I wished we got to know more about the other characters in the Flip Flapper organization. Let me break the main ones down for you though: 
Cocona: The main character. She's rational, afraid of making decisions, and indecisive. She has a kind heart and wants to do the right thing.  
Papika: Childish, loves adventuring, and has no sense danger. Her spunkiness is her charm and biggest flaw.  
Yayaka: Strong-willed, determined, and knows exactly what she wants. She'll do anything to feel like she belongs.  
I loved how the characters were all foils of each other, with Papika being incredibly childish, and Yayaka being the most adultlike, and Cocona somewhere in the middle. However, they all struggle with their feelings and conflicted between right and wrong, and we watch the characters grow through the story, which was very charming.  
However, all the other characters has little to no development, but generic character arctypes. There's the crazy scientist, the artist, and that one generic guy in a Ku Klux Klan hat who does nothing but pretend to play an important role in the story.  
And then there's the Pure Illusion characters. Since the girls travel to a different world every episode, these characters received almost no love at all after their episode. (If you've watched the show, I wanted to learn more about ""Pops,"" the scientist of Pure Illusion. He was so cool!) 
Sound: 9/10 
I loved the soundtrack to this anime. It was fun, bubbly, and fit the show. The opening is incredibly catchy, and I never skipped it. The ending gave me goosebumps after the episodes.  
This show deserves an award. I loved the colors, from Cocona and Papika having contrasting hair colors to the fun, craziness of Pure Illusion. 
Enjoyment: 9/10  
Just because I felt the other characters weren't developed doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this ride. While I believe the story suffers, this show is incredibly fun to watch. There's an episode where they even go Power Rangers style and make a big robot to save the day. 
Each individual episode has its own world, and I enjoyed the interactions the girls had with the citizens of Pure Illusion.  
Overall, this show is worth a watch if like shows like Madoka Magica, or are interested in Magic Girl in general. It has a nice spin on the genre, and I highly recommend it for its strengths.

    I decided to watch Flip Flappers because of the beautiful artwork and because I was bored. There wasn't many series I wanted to watch during fall, and because the amount of animes in Summer that failed to live up to the hype, I didn't have any shows I missed to catch up on. However after seeing a little bit of Flip Flappers artwork I decided it might be worth a shot. 
When I started watching Flip Flappers I was impressed by the visuals but nothing else really caught my attention right away. However when a few episodes later I started to enjoy the missions they went on more and more, Cocona and Papika became more lovable with every episode and by the end of the anime I wanted nothing more than for them to be happy. The artwork was some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen. The amount of detail that went into every scene was amazing and I often found myself re-watching scenes just so I could truly enjoy the artwork. This one's a minor not the biggest reason to watch the anime, but for some reason I found that the ED was catchy, cute and all around fun song to end the episode with... Definitely take a listen to the ED instead of just skipping to the next episode if you decide to watch Flip Flappers. 
The only real problems I had with Flip Flappers was the poor ending and little character development the characters received. The ending felt rushed and after finishing it I found myself with more questions with answers. This is to be expected for a 12 episode anime as closing out an anime's entire plot that fast can sometimes be quite difficult. Also being a 12 part series, it's pretty hard to give every character the development they need. However with that being said, after ending the series we know almost nothing about the Twins, Toto and Yuyu. We met the characters around the first few starting episodes, yet we learned almost nothing about them. By the end of the anime I couldn't recall anything about either of the characters. Also this is more a personal thing but I wish they talked more about what happened to Iroha Irodori, her whole life was changed from Papika and Cocona, yet they never gave her the proper closer to her story...  
I really think Flip Flappers went under appreciated and definitely believe it's a hidden treasure of 2016. I really hope more people pick it up because this series definitely deserves more praise for it's beautiful artwork and exciting characters/story...

    Flip Flappers is a great, cutesy, mahou shoujo. I enjoyed the carefree feel that Papika created on all the adventures she brought Cocona along for, and this was supported by the art style which is a very soft and smooth art style. 
I never found an episode to be overly boring, some episodes had a good bit of length that was dry but most were filled with interesting moments with very little downtime in between. The show failed to seemlessly string together a coherent backstory by the time the show ended which I did not like, but it did not completely ruin my enjoyment of the show. 
I enjoyed the dynamic between carefree Papika and the up-tight Cocona while they have to go through the many different worlds in Pure-Illusion and find the crystal hidden in each world. The ending was alright, but as I said earlier could have been great if they had presented the information better, some information about the background was never given out at all!

    Throughout my time of watching various anime, I’ve occasionally come across series that, while they may not have been popular (or no longer talked about), I found them to be legitimately good despite the lack of a real following. People commonly refer to these types of series as a “hidden gem”. This is a term that I find reflects Flip Flappers perfectly. 
The story primarily follows Cocona, a girl who is unsure about her future and who’s reluctant to make choices for fear that she’ll come to regret them later on. One day, on her way to school, she has a chance encounter and meets Papika, a very tomboyish and action-oriented girl who takes her hand and leads her on an adventure into a fantasy world known as Pure Illusion, where the two girls are tasked with finding magical stones known as “amorphous” that are said to grant wishes. Their adventure takes them through multiple dreamlike worlds on their hunt for the amorphous’, where they face fellow hunters, dastardly villains, colossal monsters, and overcome their own pasts and personal adversities. 
While I personally think that the story in Flip Flappers is wonderful, I find the execution to be...quite confusing. There were times when I’d be watching an episode and would have absolutely no idea as to what was going on. It’s not that the story is badly written, per se, it’s just that many important details about the plot, it’s characters, and the world of Pure Illusion are explained in small details that can be easy to miss if you're not paying attention. There were multiple times while watching this series that I’d have to pause or even rewatch a scene to understand what was going on. Also, while it should be obvious at this point, this anime doesn’t spoon feed you the story, there will be times when you’ll actually have to think about how certain story elements work, or connect the dots from the dialogues, since some things are not expressly explained, but can be deduced from the bits of information that they do give you. While it can be confusing, I certainly don’t mind this form of storytelling. 
I also find it worth mentioning that this series does indeed contain some fanservice and yuri undertones. However, since both are fairly low-key and not really prominent, I didn’t find either to be particularly offensive in any way. It’s just something that I wanted to point out for people (like myself) who are put off by absurd amounts of fanservice. Luckily, for Flip Flappers, it’s nothing over-the-top. 
The key characters have a reasonable amount of depth that gives each of them their own unique personality. What I found most enjoyable about the characters is how their friendships were portrayed and developed. At first, Cocona’s friendship with Papika (her partner in crim-I mean adventuring) and Yayaka (her classmate) seem to take a lighthearted and predetermined route. However, throughout the series, they each have to fight and overcome their own personal challenges and feelings to retain and save their friendships with one another, which is an aspect that I personally appreciated seeing. 
Art, Sound and Animation: 
The art is perhaps one aspect of Flip Flappers that I enjoyed most. It’s beautiful, vibrant, and has an almost dreamlike quality to it that I found myself enjoying more times than once. Some of the background art is simply wonderful and almost reminds me of a couple of Studio Ghibli’s works, as well. In fact, there’s a few background scenes which would make wonderful desktop or smartphone wallpapers. 
I think that the OP and ED songs fit the series well. I especially enjoyed the latter, finding myself humming the song on more than one occasion. Frankly, I didn’t really notice the OST all that much, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It had the right tracks fitting for the scenes in question and...that’s about it. 
The animation in this series is truly unique and worth mentioning. At times the animation resembles works from studio Trigger or even Gainax (especially during the early combat scenes), giving the animation a very unique quality that I don’t think I’ve encountered in another anime. I do think that it’s also important to note that, while the animation was fantastic for the first part of the series, I did notice that the overall quality seemed to diminish in the latter episodes, which could be attributed to the change in studios midway through the series. While it still looked great, I noticed that in the more action oriented scenes, the animation had certainly been turned down a notch. 
Although I came into this series with next to nothing in the way of expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by the end. With the myriad of seasonal anime that fall into either blatant mediocrity or in the realm of “it’s OK”, I can confidently say that this falls into neither of those categories. Despite the few small problems that I had with this series, I still give Flip Flappers a 9/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy anime that doesn’t hold your hand or spoonfeed you the story.

    Score: 4.5 out of 5 stars / 8 out of 10 
Gorgeous animation 
Unique narrative that is layered and weaves together the random elements of the first 6 or 7 episodes into a longer narrative ""pay-off"" 
The random episodes, even seemingly without a coherent plot, are a true joy to watch 
Cocona and Papika's evolving relationship 
Never knowing what to expect 
Exposition at the end felt a tad bit rushed 
Character introduced towards the end with no narrative importance 
There is an instance in episode 11 where the animation was still frames for 5 seconds.  This did not effect the story 
Not everything was fully explained in the end but the conclusion is still satisfying 
Review Summary: Innovative anime with lots of hidden nuances and metaphors behind all the fun insanity.  The story is deeper than it first appears.   
You may like this if:  You enjoy FLCL, Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, or Paprika.

    Flip Flappers is intended to be a take on the traditional ""magical girl"" genre. That said, those familiar with such themes will most definitely be thrown through a loop, at least for the first 8 episodes or so.   
Cocona is a middle schooler with a seemingly unexplained past, who is met by the eccentric girl, Papika. Papika brings Cocona through to Pure Illusion, a world with seemingly limitless potential, in order to find fragments said to grant wishes. This leads to the two girls going on a grand adventure with many interesting experiences   
This Anime could have very well been a solid 9 for me, however, the later episodes let me down thoroughly, making me hover between a 7 and 8. I'll go over what pushed me to go with 8 later, but let's start with the issues. 
If you were unaware, around episode 7, the lead scriptwriter of the show left. Whether they were removed or left of their own accord, I can't say, but what I can say is that this change definitely feels like it comes off in episodes 8 - 13.  
It's hard to tell how much of the story was planned out to end the way it did, as there have been reports some episodes being completely different from how they were originally planned. Regardless, in my opinion, the last 4 episodes of this show end up being incredibly disappointing. It's a huge shift from seemingly subtle storytelling and character building to shoving as much dialogue and exposition into every final episode as possible, almost as if they realised they wouldn't have enough time to fit their overly convoluted plot into a 13 episode season.      
And it really didn't need to be so complicated. They just as easily could have closed off the series with an equally subdued ending as the rest of the story and it would have been absolutely fine. I'm guessing budget is a big issue, and it definitely shows in the final episodes. However, they still manage to make relatively interesting settings as a backdrop to the underwhelming exposition.  
So after all that, why would I consider giving this show an 8? It's somewhat hard to explain. Throughout those first 8 or so episodes, I really felt connected with the characters and the adventure. Travelling through so many interesting settings and slowly understanding the story of each episode was really a fantastic journey. Including the fact that episodes 5 and 6 were up there with my favourite episodes of any anime I've watched.  
I honestly wish I could recommend just watching the first 8 episodes of this anime, but the entire lack of closure you get viewing up that point would ruin the experience. However, this is one anime I would be very happy to re-watch, now that I have that closure and I don't even have to worry about the later episodes.  
Regardless, if you're willing to go through half of a really good anime and fine through wading through half of a not so great anime, I would highly recommend for you to watch Flip Flappers.

    When I watched this series, I did so with skepticism.  had been introduced to the world of anime by friends who frequented phrases like, ""You'll like it, but it's very sexual and weird."" and ""Sometimes, I'm embarrassed to tell other people I like to watch this stuff!"" Of course, this absolutely shocked me. I had grown up believing anime was a lot about large scale, epic fights, and messages of friendship and perserverance. I had been introduced to what some call ""Shōnen."" The shows intended to fill the hungry hearts of young kids with empowerment! ""Yeah! anime's the coolest! I love Naruto!"" As I grew up, I began to think it was cringey, that I was weird for holding on to these Shōnen shows. I hadn't explored much else of anime, I was worried and intimidated by my friends comments. There were some shows I held on to however. I fondly remember watching some of ""K-On"" and the ""Lucario and the Mystery of Mew"" was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Just as unfortunately as the fact that these nostalgic anime aren't on this site, I unfortunately did not want to venture much further past them. Flip Flappers seemed like a simple, and charming show to me. I was entranced by the animation and the creativity of the setting (known as Pure Illusion) and I was willing to give the site a shot! So I signed up for a free trial and entered into the world of Cocona and Papika. The strong, nostalgic feelings reminded me of my own life, and the shows themes of family and being yourself are strong. At least that's part of what I got from it. That's what some people want to hear, isn't it? How do I talk about the show without spoiling it? I want the people to have the same fresh experience as me, but I don't know how to sell it! I spent the review proving how much I don't know, but I don't know how to tell you what I do. Let's start like this. Flip Flappers made me love anime. It began cute and charming, and it changed into something I could not stop watching. It's my favorite anime of this season, and possibly my favorite ever. I sit here, writing this review, and I still feel there's so much more I want to say. But I want to get these feelings out of my head and ride on the melancholic, yet incredibly, powerfully, satisfied it's ending made me feel. I hope one day I may get to talk about the show more, but for now I just have to push it and shove it onto you like a weirdo who doesn't know what he's typing. I am a safe person. I tend to love the consensus masterpieces, but FF gave me a lot more than that. It made me interested in anime again. If there's anything I do agree with the consensus on though, it's that episode 3 was my favorite. I think there's something more personal and hard to explain about why I like the show so much. It's not that it's a magical girl show (I never understood or even watched many of them), yet something about Papika and Cocona are a lot more personal and meaningful for me. I've finished the show, and now that I have a Crunchyroll I don't really know where to go from here. It would be great to know if anyone had more ideas for shows I should watch from this season it'd be awesome! I'm just really new to this. I'm gonna watch every show I can. Shows like this inspire me to make my art better and to strive for positive relationships. I want to make the most of this site and I am desperate to find another show that makes me feel these feelings.

    I am having more fun watching Flip Flappers than I have had watching a season of anime for a long time. No question you should watch this show if you are even the slightest bit interested. I will attempt to convince you to watch it even if you aren't, but if all you wanted was an opinion on whether or not to watch the show than YES, WATCH IT. If you want to know why, read on! 
Art: The most apparent thing about Flip Flappers from the get is that it is immediately visually striking. The art is sharp and colorful, with elements reminiscent of both something beautiful and charming like a Miyazaki movie and something sharp and flashy like Kill la Kill or any other Trigger show really. It is worth watching for the visual alone. 
Character: My other favorite aspect of the show. The cast isn't huge, but on the whole they are both very well developed for a show of this length and surprisingly full of pathos. They get put in situations that give you the feels. The two main characters, Papika (basically a super manic magical Little Orphan Annie) and Cocona (who pretends that she doesn't want to go on awesome adventures but also not so secretly LIVES FOR IT), are strong and sympathetic. The secondary characters are just as well-rounded, particularly Cocona's grumpy friend Yayaka. A particularly great episode explored the relationship of one of the less prominent side characters and an elderly friend who is beginning to show the signs of her advancing age. I cried a whole bunch. I had coincidentally also drank a whole bunch prior, but as mentioned above it hit me right in the feels. To say much about the characters themselves would be a spoiler, but I suspect you will like them all if you get to know them. Suffice it to say, some of the best character work in recent anime for me. 
Story: In brief: two young girls, Cocona and Papika, find out that together that they can travel to Pure Illusion, which is essentially a series of fantastic and varied alternate universes. Craziness ensues. 
While the story has been consistently uplifting and entertaining in equal measure, it could be said that it is also a bit confused. One of the particular selling point of this show for me is that each episode feels distinctly different in tone. While this does make for a very enjoyable watch, it does bounce around crazily between fun and sad and scary and cool a bit too quickly at times. The pacing is kind of frantic as well, but the nature of the show kind of supports this breakneck pace through the story. All in all I would say great but overambitious for 13 episodes. 
Sound: The opening song is great, really puts you in the mood to watch something flashy and fun which is what the show offers. The ending credits are quieter but SUPER cute, and shows us the girls navigating a more familiar and straightforward fairy tale. 
The best part of Flip Flappers is that watching it feel like as much of an adventure as Cocona and Papika are having living it. It immerses you in its remarkably vibrant world and is consequently 100% worth your time, whoever you are.

    I would recommend Flip Flappers to many people. I don't usually watch this type of anime, and I've mostly watched slice of life in the past, but I was immediately hooked on this one. It's a light-hearted, quirky, and often bizarre show. I was reminded of Alice in Wonderland in some ways. 
The story is a thumbs up. The fast pacing and different themes (mechas, magical girls, sci-fi, fantasy, fantastical) prevented it from ever being boring.  However, it could be a bit confusing at times. That's understandable since it mostly takes place in other dimensions, so it has a surreal type of atmosphere. Even if it seems odd, there was a purpose behind most of these themes. You might notice a common recurrence of 1) repetition/looping time and 2) a thine line between reality and the fantasy world called Pure Illusion, making it hard to tell what's real. I'll leave you to interpret the meaning yourself. 
The themes of the story deserve a seperate paragraph. Many negative reviews are criticizing it's lack of a profound message, but that's because they're looking at it on a literal level. It's a Bildungsroman. Cocona, the protagonist, learns an important lesson and matures. This is a difficultstory to write without it being cliche and generic. But through clever and interesting symbolism, they make a unique coming-of-age story. 
I have no serious complaints about the soundtrack.  The OP and ED were really catchy, but the soundtrack throughout the show was nothing remarkable or memorable. 
If there were one reason to dislike Flip Flappers, it would be the characters. I'll admit that Hidaka, or ""Mr. wacky science man"" as I call him, was a hilarious comic relief character. The protagonist was also a great dynamic character, as she should be in a coming-of-age story. The rest, however, were flat and cliche. You have Papika, the unrealistically hyper and optimistic girl, Yayaka, the misleadingly cold girl who isn't honest about her feelings, Dr. Salt, the badass guy with a trench coat, and then there''s Nyunyu. I don't even know what Nyunyu is supposed to be. She's a useless comic relief character who doesn't really do anything but act cute. If you don't mind slightly cliche characters, don't be discouraged from watching Flip Flappers. 
I have no complaints about the voice acting. All of their voices are in-character and they have good acting. I especially enjoyed the voice acting of Hidaka, the wacky science man I described earlier. He perfectly portrays the eccentric, hotheaded, loud, mad scientist and genuinely made me laugh almost every time he spoke. 
A few parts seemed like subtle fan service but it's debatable whether you could call it that. Some clean-minded people wouldn't even notice it, and I had no trouble ignoring it. 
Next up is the art. Thumbs up in that regard. It's colorful and unique, with Ghibli-eqsue backgrounds. It's impossible to be bored by an anime with such visually appealing art and visual effects. An observant viewer will notice many visual callbacks. 
Overall, I loved Flip Flappers. It's not for everyone, but it's so refreshing and entertaining that I had to forgive it for its flaws.

    Flip Flappers might not be a masterpiece, but it surely is a hiddem gem.  Immerse yourself in this beautiful world ""Pure Illusion"" and join Papika and Cocona in an adventure to find their true identities. I feel like this anime is better enjoyed not knowing what it is about, but I'm sure anyone will find enjoyment in this series.  Don't worry about plot, or anything, everything will develop beautifully. Enjoy the great soundtrack, psychodelic scenes, great character development.  Give this series a try, you won't regret it. 
I can praise this series for their beautiful ED, great OP, and likeable characters.  Most of them have a reason to be there (except maybe Nyunyu). 
If there's something negative I can say about this series, it would be the fact that the story doesn't explain a lot and just creates things because it looks cool.  Also, sometimes the Art leaves a lot to be desired.   
Leaving that apart, nothing is terrible, everything is enjoyable and this is surely my favorite anime of this season.

Kill La kill+ Panty and Stocking+ Madoka Magika+ muuuuuchas drogas. 
No será la mejor serie del mundo, es un poco inconsistente, no es muy original... pero tampoco quiere serlo, más bien es una colección y  una celebración de todos los grandes hitos del medio (quien la haya visto entiende lo que digo), una obra que no busca ser pedante, catárquica o trascendental; Es una obra sin pretensiones que te promete hacer pasar un buen rato, y siempre que se lo permitas, diablos si lo consigue. 
English: 
Kill La kill+ Panty and Stocking+ Madoka Magika+ a loooooot of drugs. 
It may be not the best show ever, is a little bit inconsistent, not very original... but it dosnt want to be like that, is more like a collection of, and a tribute to, the great tropes of the whole media (who saw it, knows it), a show that dosnt seek to be pedantic, cathartic or trascendental; Is a show without pretensions that promises you to have a fun time, and as long as you let it, hell if it does it

    In short : skip this and go watch something else. Seriously. 
In long : Rarely have I seen an anime that tries so hard and yet, never succeed, not even once.  
Flip Flappers is an anime who wants to be cute, fun, creative, touching and a little bit sad. It tells the story of two young girls who each times, go live an adventure on an alternate and colorful world. With a synopsis like that, I should have love the show and yet, I ended up hating it. 
The story ?While I only seen 4 episodes (I couldn’t stomach more, even skiped parts of the fourth one), there is barely a story. Most of it, it's just Papika and Cocona in the real world, then on a alternate one, fight stuff, get theirs asses kicked, get power-up, win and goodbye. They try to tease bigger stuff but it’s not the main focus ; Flip Flappers wants to create « emotions », not complex storytelling. And that could work except but here, it doesn’t for a large number of reasons. 
Each of the world is supposed to be an « hommage » to something else (Ghibli movies, Dragon Ball Z, Gurren Lagann, Hokuto No Ken, video games in general, etc...) and you’re supposed to be excited in each one of them but nope, they are too rushed and poorly conceived to make you care. Blink once and you will miss one.  
And our protagonists, the ones that are supposed to make those adventures fun ? They are trash. I only remember their name because they spend so much time screaming them (I swear half of the dialogues are just them repeating over and over « Papika !!! » and « Cocona!!! »). 
Cocona is a bland, cold, bitchy and weak tsundere. She complains every two seconds, doesn’t have the guts to really stand up for anything and always act or react in the most annoying way possible. I think you’re supposed to forgive that because « Geeez, I don’t know what to do after highschool » and « being a teenager is harsh » but nope, she is still completely unlikeable and absolutely boring. She is also supposed to be smart but that’s only said once and never seen in action. 
Papika isn’t much better : the energic and optimistic one who is basically a stalker. She stalks Cocona like crazy and try to force some bullshit yuri-romance with Cocona by touching her or sniffing her without the other consent. And look, I’m fine with yuri-pairing but when any pairing is so forced and creepy like this, I can’t help but hate it. Other than her obsession with Cocona ? Well she likes eating and sometimes she is super-strong and can beat up giants and sometimes you can take her out in one weak blow… Yeah that’s it. She has nothing for her except looking cute, being cheerful and wanting to be anywhere near Cocona.  
And the rest of the cast you may gently ask, how are they ? Well, there are non-existent. Seriously. 
Oh sorry no, I forgot the robot. The one who is a pervert who loooooves to molest underage girls… 
Yes the show has a lot of awful, awful fan service who targets underaged girls. Want to see the two num nuts turned for no reason into furries ? Want to see a naked Cocona taking a shower? Want to see Cocona bite a metaphorical giant dick for no reason? Want to see the robot ejaculate because a naked little girl who is into BDSM hit him ? Too bad, because it’s here ! So yeah, the « cute » and « cheerful » side that the show tries to push doesn’t work with shit like that. The worst is when they try to make you sad like « oh no, Papika is dead » and then, BAM, a hidden gem hidden under the skirt of Cocona near her vag turns her into a super sayan and she saves the day ! Go kindly fuck yourself for that, Flip Flappers! 
The dialogues is also completely abysmal, with characters being stuck in repeating the same three-four lines each episodes. So any attempt at being funny, relevant or touching fails right away. Really, it's very rare to witness such poor dialogues. 
And the action ? Bland because not only I’m not interested in the characters living them but also because they are just copying others better anime that I could be watching instead. Why watch a bland recreation of Dragon Ball Z when I can watch the original, who is infinitely much better ?  
But what about the art ? Every reviews talk about how wonderful and pretty and beautiful and creative this anime is ! Surely it’s his saving grace right ? NOPE. While the animation is decent and it’s clear that they worked on the D.A, it’s just decent/kinda good. It’s nothing mind blowing or impressive and there is nothing to make you care about it, unlike actual good anime. And it's funny to see that everytime there is a scene with Coco's Grandma, the budget drops by 60%. 
In the end, Flip Flappers fails. I can't recommand it, especially since there is so much better anime you could be watching instead of it who are actually fun adventure (with sometimes darker moments) like Space Dandy, Gurren Lagan, Asobi Asobase, Prison School, Gakkougurashi or Houseki no Kuni! 
Also, the op and ending are quite good, which is kinda sad when you realize they are better than the actual show.

    [This review contains minor spoilers.] 
I slightly regret watching this. 
I definitely wouldn't recommend this to others. 
I have watched this once, subtitled. 
I won't watch this again. 
---- Positives ---- 
The first part of the series is superb, assuming you enjoy fast-paced fantastical adventures. 
During ~most~ of the series [ignoring the final few episodes], the characters go on fantastical adventures that are made even more interesting through the series's great art style. Viewers learn close to the minimal amount possible in order to still be able to follow along, and this is great because by the time you're starting to understand one aspect of the series, clues about other aspects appear, keeping the experience exciting and fresh. The character types are played well and consistently, with each being unique enough to have its place in the series. There aren't any monologues - everything is figured out by the viewers and by Cocona along the way. We're never stopped and forcibly pointed at an explanation point - the degree with which things make sense depends on how much effort you put in while watching the series, also meaning that you can chose what to care about and focus on, and simply ignore other aspects of the series, all while still enjoying it overall. 
The art is very good in almost all instances. 
I liked the drawing style, which stayed consistent through most of the series. Character and camera movement during battles was also well done. In the final few episodes, quality fell a little, but was still good, since the baseline for this series was pretty high. 
The ED is great. 
The ending song and ending visuals are great. I got worried at first that the scenes depicted hinted at future events, but thankfully they didn't seem to imply what I thought they were implying. 
---- Negatives ---- 
The series shifts for the worse near the end. 
The feelings of wonder and superb stated-vs-implied balance that were so well-executed in the first part of the series are lost in the final few episodes. This shift is very abrupt and the problem persists through the end of the series, ending on a bad note. We suddenly get a marathon of previously-seen environments - previously, all environments were new and interesting, only appearing once. We see foes come back and be tossed aside again without any depth being added. Any sense of relative power levels are gotten rid of and replaced with the in-poor-taste model of combat exchanges merely for effect. The viewer, for the first time, is forced to focus on plot aspects that get mundane quickly [and won't be mentioned because spoilers]. The fantastical scenes in the end are suddenly tacky and predictable instead of imaginative and wonderful. There was a hint of something deep at the very end, when they return to the real world, but other than that, the series just trips over itself and ends - even that final gimmick was done too hastily to have any profound effect. 
Opportunity for cancel: No. I was surprised and saddened to see this series start off so great and then just fall over at the end. There are multiple ways this series could have ended, and I don't understand why ~that~ way was chosen. In addition to overall story planning falling, visual planning fell too. It was frustrating to experience because this series was close to being one of my favorites. Instead, I'm just left with a mixed, uncomfortable opinion about this series now that it's over.

    If you've ever wanted a season long shoujo magical girl ala cerebus syndrome anime of Paprika (2006), with friendship and magic saving the day, then Flip flappers is the shit you've been waiting for your whole life.  
With one of the hypesest openings made in the 21th century, soundtrack with both very ambient and poppish songs, Studio 3Hz pushing for new level of visuals I've never seen them do before, and original story on par with Paprika and Madoka in terms of creativity Flip flappers is sure to offer something for all anime fans. Combined with good voice acting, Flip flappers leaves very little room for non-nitpicky and non-personal preference sort of complaints.  
Overall Flip flappers is up there with all the rest of the big heavy hitters of 2016 (Mobb, BnHA S1, Erased, Re:Zero, Gintama.. Although it won't appeal to everyone who found some of the prior entertaining.)  
Especially recommended for fans of Panty and Stocking, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and Paprika.

    Writing a review for an abstract art film is an interesting task. Any ""meaning"" I could write about would really only be my interpretation, and to be honest I'm not really one of those guys who spends hours of time poring over and interpreting the abstract. If you are that kind of person then feel free to give it a shot, there's certainly a lot of possible meanings one could take from this.  
It's a lot harder to recommend to someone if you're not that kind of person. Not so much because it's bad, but rather because it just kind of is. The animation is certainly smooth and the art style is pleasant, but it's not something your average person would be willing to write home about.  
The music is in a rather similar boat. It's a nice inoffensive companion to the animation, but overall isn't actually anything special. I certainly couldn't see myself listening to it on its own, as it just doesn't really have enough substance to hold itself up.   
Overall what I'd say is this: It's worth giving a shot if you've got nothing better to do and ten minutes to kill, but don't feel the need to go especially out of your way to see it.

    Mizue Mirai’s animations are noteworthy for creating the sensation of a digital-esque cleanliness, despite being hand drawn. Most of Mirai's works feel like they're proof of concepts, but Wonder feels complete and in my mind is his magnum opus. This film came together when somewhere in 2012 Mirai decided to start drawing one second of a short film every day for a year, with evey day continuing from the last day. Though some parts of the film feel much simpler, as if Mirai was too busy that day to create anything impressive, the vast majoritiy of this film is wonderfully animated, with an enormous amount of different ways Mirai finds to animate different coloured shapes bending, fusing, splitting, appearing and disappearing. Sometimes, when I watch this film, I notice a moment where there is such a wealth of stuff happening at once, that I sit there in wonder: how could Mirai possibly keep track of all this stuff? 
When I first watched Wonder I didn’t really get it. I saw a few simple animations and I thought the style was interesting, but I didn’t get what the point was. The music that was playing was abstract and could barely be described as music.  This could be said for most of Mirai’s works, except for his music videos. I was starting to get a little bored and as I was debating whether I would be able to sit through all of this, suddenly this goofy ass song started playing and it immediately put a huge smile on my face. It turns out that this anime short film about abstract animation is mostly kept strung together by one of the most fun and wholesome songs I’ve ever heard in my life, and I love it.  
Now that I was hearing this lovely song I was instantly hooked and the animations suddenly made a lot more sense to me. Before there had been a few bits of sound that seemed to be timed to work with the animation, but other than that these two elements seemed divorced from each other. Now I was watching a music video, where the music informs the emotions that the visuals portray or enhance. Not only that: there was now a theme. This goofy ass song now conveyed an air of goofy fun; and with that I was hooked on getting to know what out there visuals Mirai could create and let a dense atmosphere of fun wash over me. 
When you’re looking at abstract animations like this one, what’s most interesting about them isn’t how different it is from everything else, but what things from real life it decides to keep. Wonder portrays a few things you might recognise: vaguely animal or human like shapes, waves and flowing liquid and most strangely, puking. But the most noteworthy aspect of his style is his constant use of cells. Even if it’s just a strangely shaped splatter of paint, many of Mirai’s creations will have a coloured circle inside a different coloured circle inside of it. Most of these creations are coloured dots with tails that often swim around, so it’s clear they’re meant to look like cells; but he also sometimes uses what somewhat looks like naturalistic pencil drawings of plant cells. 
One of my favourite moments in the film is when a couple of green dots bounce around on a black mass of sorts and it both looks like they’re bouncing around on a piece of some elastic material and like they’re sinking into the black mass like your fingers would into a mass of watery foam. How exactly he manages to uphold both these feelings at the same time is still a mystery to me, but perplexing details, that you might not catch on your first watch, are what to me makes Mirai’s style irreplacable. 
Later in the film there is a moment where the music changes. Suddenly there is a spooky air to the film and the visuals change to match. Despite me saying that the music is what strings the animation together, the music hasn’t done that great of a job untill this point of matching big changes of what’s happening on screen. It doesn’t quite feel like it was handcrafted to match Mirai’s work. But this change in the music is different and properly signifies a change in theme that the animation was going through.  
I call it spooky, but if it’s that, it would be some of the most wholesome and goofy spooky music I’ve ever heard. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else would raise his eyebrows when I referred to it as spooky and would use a completely different word. That said, the visuals from this point on are definitely a bit more disturbing. There is a larger focus on human like shapes and there’s even some puking. One moment involves a cell swimming down a tight corridor and finding at the end of it a bigger cell without a tail, resembling insemination. Where as in earlier segments of the film there could be tons of colours on the screen at once, this part consistently limits itself to smaller colour palettes. This is also the part of the film where you might notice that the colouring job Mirai is doing is getting rougher and rougher and you can clearly see he’s using paint. 
After this section there is one more short, fun bit like the rest of the film, before there is another shift is music and visuals. The music is now accompanied by vocals. All they sing is: Wawwa, Wawwa. It’s very goofy. But whereas the music is being added to, the animation is devolving. Shapes are getting rougher and rougher and the transitions get less smooth and animated and random images start flashing across the screen. This is ususally the part of the film where I wake and realise what a deep trance I have been in. I let a slight sigh and as I slowly leave the trance, I feel as if I’m under the shower and the water is slowly getting colder. I decide to enjoy the last moments of the film as it quickly devolves into random splatters of paint and ends. I will also give an epilepsy warning for this final part of the film. 
Wonder is one of those anime I can frequently watch and once I’ve finished it, automatically sigh: “God I love this anime.” It’s not a perfect anime, but it also never gets old. It’s not an anime you think deeply about afterwards, but it’s one you will occasionally crave for that in-the-moment experience. Mirai’s craftsmanship is unique and I’m very happy it exists.   
If you want to get into Mirai’s other works, there’s a few recommendations I have. ‘Playground’ feels like it’s an earlier rendition of Wonder, made by a less experienced and established Mirai. ‘And And’ and ‘Poker’ are both music video’s like wonder, though I personally don’t like them quite as much. More famous earlier works of Mirai like ‘a log day of timbre’ and ‘Jam’ don’t give anything that Wonder can’t give you; that’s why I referred to them as ‘Proof of concept,’ but they’re not awful. I rated ‘The baby birds of Norman McLaren’ a 7 on mal, but I don’t remember why. A less worked out short that’s completely different from Wonder is ‘Modern,’ which has a very different, more geometrical, animation style. Lastly there is ‘Futsuu tte Nandarou?’ Which is a collection of 5 short stories, by random people, with accompanying animation from 5 different animators. Though  I couldn’t find a translated version last I checked. None of these hold up, however, to Wonder. I love this movie and with this review I hoped to properly convey what I love about it so much, as I can’t find anyone else who has done so yet. And maybe if you didn’t get it and you read my review out of confusion, you might now be able to return to it and appreaciate it’s brilliance. Though probably not.

    (4/10 is a good score for me, see my profile) 
Wonder isn't particularly visually mind bending, in fact I imagine anyone watching this has seen similar blobby animated doodles in the past, either as little animated gifs or as more properly realised flash animations on Newgrounds or someplace like that. It isn't boring, but since I am such a visually minded person when it comes to film criticism I was naturally drawn to the mechanical process of the movement, and in that respect the film doesn't blow me away. It's merely quite pretty. 
What distinguishes this one is that it's hand drawn and that it was made over the course of a year, with 24 frames being drawn in one day as a strict timetable. That it was hand drawn does not interest me in the slightest, but the strict structuring of development is actually quite interesting to me as it brings out the devices of improvisation and the process of shifting interests. 
Essentially the film is a fascinating visual diagram of animator Mizue's trains of thought, in that his imagination is captured for a few days or a week maybe on one specific idea before moving on to another. One idea is a series of colourful amorphous blobs drifting without purpose until they are dissected by a rigid spike running around in a circle, but then a second later it all dissolves and a new idea emerges. Perhaps not all the ideas are visually captivating, but some of them are and anyway the cycle of their inception and then retirement is more than enough to make this short worth watching regardless. 
The ending segment makes me want to see Mizue tackle paint-on-film animation, as it reminded me of The Dante Quartet by Stan Brakhage.

An art film 
-An interesting concept for an introduction but it still left question alive. Such as why is he doing this search? was he assigned the task? Was he just curious? Was this a family event? Was their a reward? The underlining purpose was a mystery. 
-Conclusion did not make much sense. In short one could say a damned fire now burnt brightly only to turn into inferno? 
- story's message No matter how difficult a situation presents to be one can find light or good in it. 
-puppet show animation 
-background was fuzzy at some points 
- background did not match characters 
- not realistic 
-A one person narrated story for any character regardless of sex. Was not a wise call. Especially because of the switch over in character insight. 
Wished hard for the movie to end. Was not being properly entertained. I did feel some pain for the main character of the story but i was not captivated. If old folk tales or puppets are your thing you may like this.

    Many users review series and animated movies following MAL guidelines and categorizing their rating. Sometimes they fail, because not everything is supposed to be treated as a part of the anime industry: there are also independent works, whose story is not always important, because they last a bunch of minutes, whose art is not always captivating, since they were made back in the 60s or 70s and try to be expressive more than realistic. The same goes for western movies: you can't rate sound, for example, if you're watching a silent film or dislike a black and white movie only because colors are not there. 
Kataku is a short independent, stop motion animated movie from 1979. It's a completely different experience from a yesterday-made series with bursting colors and flashing animation. A great experience I'd say. 
The masterful animation makes the story seem real and the plot, adapted from a play, is short but meaningful. You can feel the touch of the director in every frame. Kataku is something you must interpret with your heart and brain combined, considering the director was not supported by a studio, stop motion is a complex technique and many years have passed since 1979. The story is also from a traditional play, so strictly linked with Japanese culture and sensibility. 
I give it a 6, probably the best score a 19 minutes movie can achieve. I strongly recommend it to anyone, especially those who usually don't care about old works and independent artists. Just watch it and look how animation can also be something more than flat entertainment.

    Ok now i dont usually review all the season of an anime but in this case I felt i had to. This is the kind of anime that makes when you are watching it makes you go ""WAIT IS THAT TRUE?""! I wish there was a way to actually know if the information given in an anime like this is fact or fiction (Like Rurouni Kenshin- where Himura Kenshin  wielded the “reverse-edge sword”) 
The second season (can also be called season 1 part 2) picks up from where the first left off and added a bucket full of testosterone to this anime!  
And boy do they sure know how to make it so you binge it all in one go. The characters and their motivation/ background are shown in such depth that you connect with them regardless of who or why they are fighting against 
The artwork for these back stories was also a completely different type that just added more color to each charterer!  
The anime should get a season 3 since its netflix ( I REALLY WANT A NEXT SEASON!) BUT REGARDLESS the ending of the season will leave you with whole lot of good feeling and wanting there to be more!

    Kengan Ashura 
I liked everything about this season. The fights, the ost, the dynamic between the characters, the animation and hell, even the CG. It has good fights and some interesting characters and character designs. 
The fight that i liked the most was Ohma vs Raian because both went insane when they fought each other. Kengan Ashura is similar to Baki and thats why i like it, but also it has things on its own that make it good. I cannot wait for the 3rd and maybe last season. 
In terms of scores: 
Story- 7 
Art- 8 
Characters- 10  
Overall- 9 
I recommend it to those that want to watch good fights, with great soundtrack and cool techniques.

    Holy shit this show was one hell of a ride. Personally, I hate CGI/""animated anime"" but this show surprisingly pulled it off and I didn't mind the art style at all. Every single episode from episode 2 of the first season to episode 12 of the second had me on the edge of my goddamn seat. The show didnt waste ANY time on fillers. All 20+ minutes of every episode was packed with beautifully animated and unique combat, important character building scenes or something that enhanced or had meaning to the plot, a no bullshit straight to the point show. The shows characters are all unique and diverse in their own ways which is hard to pull off. The main character is one hell of a badass as well, and that's the first time I've ever said that. They really pulled it off with the MC here. Sounds were all amazing and I couldn't ask for more except a third season. 
TL;DR: Watch this show, it gets addicting at around episode 2 of season 1. MC is a badass and the show wastes no time. Fight scenes are beautifully animated and the art style Is easy to get used to.

    Well as for the story it's the 2nd season of kengan ashura so the story continued from the 1st season .... it's started from the 5th match of the 1st round of the tournament  
art quality , sound & character development was really cool to me , i would say it has developed from the 1st season a bit  
as the anime has focused each n every match of the tournament , where the different kind of fighter clash with one another , and their individual techniques and little bit past story makes every fight worth watching & unpredictable  ... and the enjoyment was at it's level best ..... 
so i highly recommend this anime to every action anime lover

    More kengan ashura? hell yes. 
So this is the second half of kengan ashura. It still delivers the same epic fights we got in the first season. Of course its animated in cgi but it still looks amazing and the animation is pretty smooth.  
The fights still contain a lot of action, testosterone and blood. Thus far my favorite fight has been Hanafusa vs Bando. Why? It was quite interesting to see what kind of fighter Hanafusa is. The man survived having his neck broken. The second one is Okubo vs Fang. 
The story is still the same. Fighting the kengan tournament. But we now progress to the second phase of the tournament. 
We got tons of more good characters. Kuroki is badass as fuck and Sao Pang reminds me of Asta. He is also quite the screamer but he is funny and tough beyond tough.  
I still love this anime a lot. Well, now lets just wait for the third season. This is awesome after you get past the cgi. I have recommended this to 3 friends so far and they all have been saying this is one of the greatest anime they have ever seen.

    Many people will be having doubts about whether we should be watching this because of the CG animation but don't let it stop from watching it. It is a great series. The fight choreography is simply awesome. You actually feel the characters are fighting instead of some static images. The fight scenes were really intense and exciting. I had a really fun time watching it. Baki fans are gonna have a great time with it even though this series turned out to be much better than Baki. All in all, it is great fighting series to enjoy. Have a good day everyone.
