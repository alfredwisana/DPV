Aesthetics

1. x-axis
2. y-axis
3. Color
4. Shape
5. Size 

Cannot understand the graph without the x-axis (data) n y-axis(categorical)

SCALE

Map to 1:1 1 data -> 1 graph
	MAP 1 TYPE OF DATA TO 1 AESTHAETICS


For every type of visualizations
	- Determine the number of aesthatics (some allow 2, some 2, some 4)
	- For every Aesthatics determine the type of data ( qual vs quant , cont vs disc)

Position Scales: Map 1 Data to 1 Position
	Using cartesian coordinates -> to find the position
		x-axis n y-axis
		Use of coordinates 



SLIDE CH.2 NO 6
	Compress / spread --> all of them are valid
	Not wise to manipulate the data -> not using the scale  correctly

IF USE THE SAME UNIT in the x-axis n y-axis --> use the same distance between the data --> equal lenght

NonLinear Axes --> the progression is not linear


5 - 15 - 30 - 50 ==> if visualize can be larger 

Used the log scale --> dynamic equation

Outliers ==> Data that have an anomaly, seperate themselves
	Very low number or very large numbers
	Make the visualization hard to understand

Log transform the data --> transform the data value
Make The Visualization is smaller --> not showing the difference


Curved Axes
	1. Angle
	2. Radius
